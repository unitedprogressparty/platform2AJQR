## Investing in Public Health, Research, and Global Cooperation

The health and well-being of our nation depend on a robust public health infrastructure capable of preventing disease, responding effectively to outbreaks, and pursuing ambitious research goals to tackle humanity's most persistent health challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in our preparedness and highlighted the devastating consequences of underinvestment in public health and scientific research.

Our platform calls for a transformative investment in disease prevention, pandemic preparedness, and biomedical research. We must strengthen our public health agencies, rebuild global health security partnerships, and set audacious goals, including the pursuit of cures for major diseases that afflict millions.

### Key Strategies for Disease Prevention and Pandemic Preparedness:

1.  **Strengthen Public Health Infrastructure:**
    *   Significantly increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state and local health departments, and the public health workforce. This includes investing in disease surveillance systems, laboratory capacity, data modernization, and workforce training.
    *   Ensure equitable access to preventive services, including vaccinations, screenings, and health education, particularly in underserved communities.

2.  **Enhance Pandemic Preparedness and Response:**
    *   Establish a permanent, well-funded national pandemic preparedness and response capability, learning lessons from COVID-19. This includes maintaining stockpiles of essential medical supplies (PPE, tests, therapeutics), developing rapid response plans, and ensuring clear communication strategies.
    *   Invest in platform technologies for rapid vaccine and therapeutic development and manufacturing capacity that can be quickly scaled up during a public health emergency.
    *   Strengthen global health security initiatives, including support for the World Health Organization (WHO) and international cooperation on disease surveillance, research, and response. Re-engage in global partnerships to prevent outbreaks from becoming pandemics.

3.  **Launch Ambitious Disease Research Initiatives ("Cure All Diseases"):**
    *   Set bold national goals and dramatically increase federal funding for biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies, aiming for breakthroughs against major diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria), and emerging threats.
    *   Foster innovative research models, including public-private partnerships, high-risk/high-reward grant programs (like ARPA-H), and large-scale data sharing initiatives (while protecting privacy).
    *   Prioritize research into the social determinants of health and health disparities to ensure that scientific advancements benefit all populations equitably.

4.  **Address Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):**
    *   Implement a national action plan to combat AMR, including promoting antibiotic stewardship in healthcare and agriculture, investing in the development of new antibiotics and alternative therapies, and strengthening surveillance of resistant infections.

5.  **Promote Global Health Equity:**
    *   Support global efforts to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries, recognizing that infectious diseases know no borders. Invest in global vaccination programs, disease eradication efforts, and capacity building for international health organizations.

### Conclusion:

Investing in public health, pandemic preparedness, and ambitious biomedical research is essential for national security, economic prosperity, and human well-being. By strengthening our domestic public health infrastructure, enhancing our ability to respond to future pandemics, pursuing cures for devastating diseases through bold research initiatives, and promoting global health equity, we can build a healthier, safer, and more resilient future for all.
