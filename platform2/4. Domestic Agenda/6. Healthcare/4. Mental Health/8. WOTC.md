## Promoting Employment Opportunities for Individuals in Recovery

Stable employment is a critical factor in long-term recovery from mental health conditions and substance use disorders (SUD). Meaningful work provides economic stability, structure, purpose, and social connection, all of which support well-being. However, individuals with histories of mental illness or addiction often face significant stigma and barriers when seeking employment.

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is an existing federal program that provides tax credits to employers who hire individuals from certain targeted groups facing significant barriers to employment. Our platform advocates for **expanding and enhancing the WOTC program to specifically incentivize the hiring and retention of individuals with documented histories of mental health conditions or SUD who are actively engaged in treatment or recovery.**

### Key Strategies for Expanding WOTC for Mental Health and Recovery:

1.  **Designate Individuals in Recovery as a WOTC Target Group:**
    *   Explicitly add individuals with qualifying mental health diagnoses or histories of SUD (who meet certain criteria, such as recent participation in treatment or recovery support programs) as a distinct target group eligible for the WOTC.

2.  **Increase the Value and Duration of the Tax Credit:**
    *   Increase the maximum tax credit available to employers for hiring individuals from this target group to provide a stronger financial incentive.
    *   Potentially extend the duration for which the credit can be claimed beyond the first year of employment to encourage long-term retention.

3.  **Streamline Certification Process:**
    *   Develop a clear, confidential, and streamlined process for certifying an individual's eligibility based on participation in treatment or recovery programs, protecting applicant privacy while minimizing administrative burden for employers. This could involve partnerships with state vocational rehabilitation agencies or certified treatment providers.

4.  **Employer Education and Support:**
    *   Fund outreach and education campaigns to inform employers about the benefits of hiring individuals in recovery, the availability of the enhanced WOTC, and resources for creating supportive workplace environments (e.g., reasonable accommodations, anti-stigma training).
    *   Partner with recovery organizations and mental health providers to connect qualified job seekers with participating employers.

5.  **Integration with Supported Employment Programs:**
    *   Ensure the enhanced WOTC complements existing supported employment programs (like Individual Placement and Support - IPS) that provide ongoing job coaching and support for individuals with serious mental illness.

### Conclusion:

Expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to specifically include individuals recovering from mental health conditions and substance use disorders is a practical, market-based strategy to combat stigma and open doors to employment. By providing financial incentives to employers, we can encourage the hiring and retention of a capable workforce segment that often faces unfair barriers. This policy aligns with our commitment to supporting recovery, promoting economic opportunity, and building inclusive communities. Meaningful work is a key component of recovery, and the WOTC can be a powerful tool to facilitate that journey.
