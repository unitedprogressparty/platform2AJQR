## Ensuring Dignified Care and Upholding Rights in Long-Term Mental Health Settings

Individuals living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) often require long-term care and support. However, the current system frequently fails these individuals, marked by inadequate community-based services, challenges in accessing appropriate residential care, overuse of institutionalization, and complex ethical dilemmas surrounding involuntary treatment.

Our platform advocates for reforming long-term mental healthcare to prioritize community integration, recovery-oriented practices, and the protection of individual rights, while ensuring that appropriate interventions, including carefully regulated involuntary treatment, are available when necessary to protect individuals and the public from harm. We must also improve the quality and oversight of residential care facilities, including "old folks homes" (nursing homes and assisted living) where many individuals with mental health needs reside.

### Key Strategies for Reforming Long-Term Mental Healthcare:

1.  **Expand Community-Based Support Services:**
    *   Massively invest in a full continuum of community-based mental health services, including Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams, supportive housing, psychosocial rehabilitation programs, supported employment, and peer support networks. The goal is to enable individuals with SPMI to live successfully and with dignity in the community whenever possible.

2.  **Improve Residential Care Options:**
    *   Increase funding and oversight for a range of residential care options, from group homes to specialized nursing facilities, ensuring they provide high-quality, recovery-oriented care and protect resident rights.
    *   Address workforce shortages and improve training for staff in long-term care facilities ("old folks homes") regarding mental health needs and de-escalation techniques.
    *   Promote smaller, more integrated residential settings over large, institutional facilities.

3.  **Reform Involuntary Treatment Laws and Practices:**
    *   **Careful Expansion and Strict Oversight:** Recognize that in limited circumstances, involuntary treatment (outpatient or inpatient commitment) may be necessary for individuals who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others due to severe mental illness and lack capacity to make informed decisions. However, any **expansion of involuntary treatment criteria must be approached with extreme caution**, accompanied by robust due process protections, strict judicial oversight, regular reviews, and clear standards based on imminent risk, not just diagnosis or non-compliance.
    *   **Prioritize Least Restrictive Alternatives:** Mandate that involuntary commitment is used only as a last resort after all less restrictive voluntary options and community supports have been exhausted or deemed inappropriate.
    *   **Advance Directives and Supported Decision-Making:** Promote the use of psychiatric advance directives and supported decision-making models to maximize individual autonomy even when capacity is fluctuating.
    *   **Gradient of Control and Care:** Ensure a "gradient of control and care" exists, offering various levels of support and intervention tailored to individual needs and capacity, ranging from voluntary community services to, in rare cases, court-ordered treatment under strict legal safeguards.

4.  **Integrate Mental and Physical Healthcare in Long-Term Settings:**
    *   Ensure residents of long-term care facilities receive integrated physical and mental healthcare to address co-occurring conditions effectively.

5.  **Combat Stigma and Promote Recovery:**
    *   Challenge the stigma associated with severe mental illness through public education and promote recovery-oriented approaches that emphasize hope, empowerment, and self-determination.

### Conclusion:

Reforming long-term mental healthcare requires a commitment to community integration, individual rights, and high-quality, recovery-focused care. While carefully regulated involuntary treatment may have a limited role for individuals posing imminent danger, the primary focus must be on expanding voluntary community-based services and supportive housing. Improving residential care options and ensuring robust oversight are crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals. By investing in a comprehensive continuum of care and upholding individual rights, we can create a system that supports recovery and allows people with severe mental illness to live with dignity.
