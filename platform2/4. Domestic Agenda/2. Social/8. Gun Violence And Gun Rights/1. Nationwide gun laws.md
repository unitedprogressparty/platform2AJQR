THis is filler content. We support the 2md amendment, and furthermore think everybody should own and train with one or more firearms. We bleieve that current and recent gun legislation is bat shit crazy and unamerican and a major problem going forward.
## Balancing Rights with Public Safety Through Comprehensive Federal Action

Gun violence is a public health crisis that demands comprehensive federal action. While respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, we must implement evidence-based policies to reduce gun deaths and injuries, prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands, and ensure responsible gun ownership. A patchwork of state laws creates dangerous loopholes and undermines safety nationwide. Our platform advocates for establishing uniform, common-sense federal standards for gun ownership, sales, and safety.

### Key Components of Nationwide Gun Safety Standards:

1.  **Universal Background Checks:**
    *   Mandate comprehensive background checks for *all* firearm sales and transfers, including those at gun shows, online, and between private individuals. Close the loopholes that allow prohibited purchasers (e.g., individuals with felony convictions, domestic violence restraining orders, severe mental health adjudications) to acquire guns without scrutiny.

2.  **Standardized and Responsible Permitting ("Shall Issue" with Strong Criteria):**
    *   Establish uniform federal standards for concealed carry permits based on a "shall issue" framework, *provided* applicants meet stringent, objective criteria. This includes comprehensive background checks, mandatory safety training (including live-fire training and safe storage education), and clear disqualifiers for violent histories or dangerous behavior. This approach aims to ensure non-discriminatory access for qualified individuals while maintaining high safety standards, replacing subjective "may issue" systems that can be prone to bias, while avoiding permitless carry systems that eliminate safety checks altogether.

3.  **Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs / "Red Flag" Laws):**
    *   Enact a federal ERPO law and provide funding to incentivize states to adopt their own. These laws allow temporary removal of firearms by court order from individuals demonstrably posing an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others, ensuring due process while providing a critical tool for intervention in crises. Make temporary court-ordered removal easier and more accessible for families and law enforcement under clear procedural safeguards.

4.  **Re-evaluating Restrictions on Certain Firearms and Accessories (NFA Items, Capacity Limits):**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive, evidence-based review of current federal regulations under the National Firearms Act (NFA) concerning short-barreled rifles (SBRs), short-barreled shotguns (SBSs), suppressors, and "Any Other Weapons" (AOWs), as well as regulations on firearm parts kits ("80% receivers"). The review should assess whether current restrictions effectively enhance public safety relative to their impact on law-abiding owners, and consider potential reforms that maintain safety while potentially reducing unnecessary burdens or clarifying ambiguous regulations.
    *   Similarly, review and potentially reinstate federal limits on high-capacity magazines, recognizing their frequent use in mass casualty events. Any relaxation of current restrictions must be strictly justified by evidence demonstrating no significant negative impact on public safety.

5.  **Restoring Rights for Certain Non-Violent Felonies:**
    *   Review federal and state laws that impose lifetime firearm bans for *certain* non-violent felony convictions, particularly those disproportionately affecting marginalized communities or related to offenses (like drug possession) that are being reconsidered under broader criminal justice reform efforts. Explore pathways for rights restoration for individuals who have served their sentences and demonstrated rehabilitation, balancing public safety with principles of restorative justice. This does *not* extend to violent felonies or individuals otherwise prohibited due to risk factors.

6.  **Eliminating Unjustified "Carve Outs" and Exemptions:**
    *   Review existing federal and state gun laws to identify and eliminate unwarranted exemptions or "carve outs" that weaken safety standards for specific groups or types of firearms without clear public safety justification. Ensure laws apply consistently and fairly.

### Conclusion:

Establishing responsible nationwide gun laws requires a balanced approach that respects rights while prioritizing public safety and equity. By implementing universal background checks, standardized permitting, effective ERPO laws, and by carefully reviewing existing regulations and restrictions through an evidence-based lens, we can reduce gun violence and make our communities safer for everyone. This comprehensive federal framework aims to replace the current inconsistent patchwork of state laws with uniform standards that protect both lives and liberties.
