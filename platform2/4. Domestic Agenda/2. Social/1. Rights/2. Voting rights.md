title: "         2. Voting rights"

See Campagin Finance Reform


We believe that every eligible citizen must have unfettered access to the ballot as the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. In recent years, systemic attacks on voting rights—including restrictive state laws, voter roll purges, and court decisions that have weakened the Voting Rights Act—have undermined our national commitment to equal representation. This platform proposes bold federal action to reverse these trends, expand voter participation, and modernize our election system.

---

### 1. Expand and Standardize Voter Registration

- **Automatic Voter Registration:**  
  • Mandate that all federal agencies transfer voter registration information electronically to state election officials when citizens interact with government services (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles, public universities).  
  • Allow citizens to opt out but default to registration to boost participation and update voter rolls in real time.

- **Same-Day and Online Registration:**  
  • Require states to offer same‑day registration at polling locations and online registration options to ensure no eligible voter is turned away on Election Day.  
  • Create federal standards that guarantee user-friendly, secure online systems accessible to young voters, seniors, and people with disabilities.

- **National Voter Registration Portal:**  
  • Establish a unified portal maintained by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) that provides clear guidance, real‑time updates, and multilingual support, ensuring all Americans can register regardless of their geographic or socioeconomic background.

### 2. Ensure Broad Access to the Ballot

- **Expanded Early Voting and Mail‑In Voting:**  
  • Require states to offer a minimum of a 15‑day early voting period and no‑excuse absentee/mail‑in voting to accommodate all citizens, including those who work irregular hours or live in remote areas.  
  • Make Election Day a federal holiday to guarantee that every eligible voter has ample opportunity to participate.

- **Secure and Accessible Polling Places:**  
  • Implement federal standards for polling place accessibility, ensuring that locations are distributed equitably and serve communities of all sizes.  
  • Mandate that states maintain adequate numbers of polling places and prevent the closure of sites that disproportionately serve minority and underserved communities.

---

### 3. Restore and Strengthen the Voting Rights Act

- **New Coverage Formula for Preclearance:**  
  • Reinstate robust federal oversight by enacting the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This includes a new, data‑driven coverage formula that requires states with a documented history of discriminatory voting practices to obtain federal preclearance before changing election laws.  
  • Ensure that any significant changes to voter identification rules, voting locations, or registration procedures in these jurisdictions receive rigorous federal review.

- **Federal Preclearance and Bail‑In Mechanisms:**  
  • Expand federal authority to intervene when state or local changes have a discriminatory impact. Empower the Attorney General and, when necessary, a three‑judge panel to issue temporary injunctions (bail‑ins) that block harmful changes until compliance with non‑discrimination standards is demonstrated.

- **Legislative Response to Judicial Attacks:**  
  • Acknowledge the damage done by the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which invalidated the outdated coverage formula for Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Our platform calls on Congress to pass comprehensive legislation that restores federal protections by updating the formula to reflect current demographics and discriminatory practices.

### 4. Modernize Election Administration and Protect Against Voter Suppression

- **Uniform National Standards:**  
  • Establish baseline federal standards for all aspects of election administration—from voter registration and ballot design to the processing and tabulation of votes—to reduce administrative errors and prevent manipulation.  
  • Require that states implement secure, technology‑driven solutions that protect against cyberattacks while preserving the secrecy and integrity of the ballot.

- **Opposing Restrictive State Measures:**  
  • Condemn recent trends where state legislatures have enacted laws that limit early voting, impose strict voter ID requirements, purge voter rolls, or close polling places. Studies show that such measures disproportionately affect minority, young, and low‑income voters.
  • Support research and data collection initiatives (in partnership with academic institutions and the EAC) to monitor and publicly report on the effects of these restrictions, reinforcing the federal commitment to equal access.

- **Defending Against Misinformation and Unconstitutional Changes:**  
  • Implement public information campaigns to educate citizens on their voting rights and counteract false claims regarding widespread voter fraud.  
  • Strengthen legal support for communities facing disenfranchisement and provide resources to challenge state‑level voting restrictions through litigation when necessary.

---

### 5. Reform Campaign Finance and Redistricting to Enhance Electoral Fairness

- **Campaign Finance Reform:**  
  • Support measures such as voluntary public financing, matching funds for small‑dollar contributions, and transparency reforms to limit the outsized influence of money in politics.  
  • Reduce the impact of dark money on elections, ensuring that all citizens can participate on an equal footing.

- **Independent Redistricting Commissions:**  
  • Mandate that redistricting be conducted by independent, nonpartisan commissions with balanced representation, thereby reducing partisan gerrymandering and protecting minority interests.  
  • Establish clear criteria to ensure electoral districts are drawn fairly, reflecting demographic changes and ensuring meaningful representation.

---

### 6. Address Ongoing Attacks on Voting Rights

- **Judicial and Legislative Context:**  
  • Recognize that the erosion of voting rights protection has been driven by both legislative actions at the state level and key judicial decisions such as Shelby County v. Holder, which significantly weakened federal oversight.  
  • Document and publicize how recent court decisions have paved the way for states to enact restrictive measures—such as strict voter ID laws, shortened early voting periods, and voter purges—that undermine democracy.

- **Counteracting Restrictive Federal Proposals:**  
  • Actively oppose any federal measures (e.g., the proposed SAVE Act or other bills requiring proof-of-citizenship that lack empirical support) which serve as a pretext for disenfranchising eligible voters, including naturalized citizens, college students, and tribal voters.
  • Affirm that any federal reform must prioritize expanding access, not restricting it, and safeguard against policies that have been shown to be based on unfounded claims of widespread fraud.

We support The For the People / Freedom to Vote Act
Originally introduced as the For the People Act in 2019 (and reintroduced in subsequent Congresses), this comprehensive bill aims to:

Expand voting access: It would mandate automatic, same‑day, and online voter registration; extend early voting and mail‑in voting opportunities; and even make Election Day a federal holiday.
Modernize election administration: The bill sets national standards for voter registration and poll administration, which is intended to reduce administrative errors and ensure consistency.
Campaign finance and redistricting reforms: By reducing the influence of money in politics and curbing partisan gerrymandering, it indirectly strengthens the democratic process. (See 
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 for a summary of its provisions.)
### Conclusion

Our platform envisions a future where voting is accessible, secure, and free from discrimination. By implementing uniform federal standards, restoring and modernizing critical protections like the Voting Rights Act, and countering both state-level voter suppression and misguided federal proposals, we can ensure that every citizen’s voice is heard. These measures are not only necessary to preserve the integrity of our democracy—they are essential to fulfilling the promise of equal representation for all Americans.
