## Reforming Failed Cannabis Policies for Justice and Public Health

The decades-long prohibition of marijuana has been a colossal failure. It has fueled mass incarceration, disproportionately harmed communities of color, diverted law enforcement resources from addressing serious crime, and prevented legitimate research into the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis. Continuing this prohibitionist approach is unjust, ineffective, and out of step with public opinion and evolving state laws.

Our platform calls for the comprehensive **federal legalization of marijuana** for adult recreational and medical use. This reform must be accompanied by a robust regulatory framework designed to ensure public health and safety, promote social equity, generate tax revenue for public investment, and repair the harms caused by the failed War on Drugs.

### Key Components of Marijuana Legalization and Regulation:

1.  **Federal Decriminalization and Legalization:**
    *   Remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act entirely, ending federal prohibition and allowing states to regulate cannabis as they see fit, similar to alcohol.
    *   Establish a clear federal framework for interstate commerce, product safety standards, and taxation.

2.  **Expungement and Restorative Justice:**
    *   Automatically expunge all past federal convictions for non-violent marijuana offenses.
    *   Establish a federal grant program to assist states in expunging state-level marijuana convictions.
    *   Create a dedicated **Community Reinvestment Fund**, financed by federal cannabis tax revenue, to invest in communities most harmed by marijuana prohibition, focusing on education, job training, economic development, and healthcare services.

3.  **Social Equity in the Cannabis Industry:**
    *   Implement licensing programs that prioritize applicants from communities disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs, including people of color and individuals with prior marijuana convictions.
    *   Provide access to capital, technical assistance, and mentorship programs to support small businesses and equity applicants seeking to enter the legal cannabis market.
    *   Prevent the monopolization of the industry by large corporations.

4.  **Robust Regulation and Public Health:**
    *   Establish strict regulations for the cultivation, processing, testing, packaging, and labeling of cannabis products to ensure consumer safety and prevent youth access. Mandate clear potency labeling and warnings.
    *   Implement comprehensive public health campaigns focused on responsible use, prevention of impaired driving, and youth education.
    *   Fund research into the long-term health effects of cannabis use and its potential therapeutic applications.

5.  **Taxation for Public Benefit:**
    *   Implement a federal excise tax on cannabis products, with revenue dedicated to:
        *   The Community Reinvestment Fund (as mentioned above).
        *   Funding public health programs related to substance use education and treatment.
        *   Supporting regulatory oversight and enforcement.
        *   Investing in infrastructure and other public services.
    *   Coordinate federal taxation with state tax structures to avoid excessive burdens that could fuel illicit markets.

### Conclusion:

Ending federal marijuana prohibition is a matter of justice, common sense, and public health. By legalizing and regulating cannabis, we can end the disproportionate enforcement that has devastated communities of color, generate significant tax revenue for public investment, create economic opportunities, and redirect law enforcement resources toward more pressing issues. This comprehensive approach ensures that legalization is implemented responsibly, equitably, and in a manner that repairs past harms while safeguarding public well-being.
