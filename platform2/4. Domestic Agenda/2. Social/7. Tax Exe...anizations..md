## Balancing Public Benefit with Public Accountability

Tax-exempt organizations, including charities, foundations, religious institutions, and advocacy groups, play a vital role in American civil society. They provide essential services, foster community engagement, and enrich public discourse. The tax-exempt status granted to these organizations is a recognition of their contribution to the public good, allowing them to dedicate more resources to their missions rather than tax obligations.

However, this privileged status must come with commensurate accountability and transparency. In recent years, concerns have grown about the potential for abuse of tax-exempt status. Large foundations can amass significant wealth with limited payout requirements, some organizations engage in opaque political spending that skirts campaign finance laws ("dark money"), and certain entities may operate primarily for private benefit rather than public good.

Our platform advocates for reforms that preserve the vital role of the non-profit sector while ensuring that tax-exempt status is not exploited to shield wealth, exert undue political influence, or avoid public scrutiny. We believe in strengthening oversight to guarantee that these organizations genuinely serve the public interest that justifies their tax exemption.

### Key Reforms for Tax-Exempt Organization Accountability:

1.  **Increased Transparency for Political Spending:**
    *   Require all 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organizations and other tax-exempt groups engaging in significant electioneering or lobbying activities to disclose their major donors, mirroring rules for political committees. Eliminate loopholes that allow "dark money" to flood our political system anonymously through non-profits.

2.  **Strengthen Oversight of Private Foundations:**
    *   Increase the mandatory annual payout requirement for private foundations (currently 5% of assets) to ensure that accumulated wealth is actively deployed for charitable purposes rather than sitting indefinitely in endowments.
    *   Enhance IRS oversight and auditing capacity to scrutinize foundation spending, ensuring funds are used for legitimate charitable activities and not for excessive administrative costs or private inurement.

3.  **Clarify Rules for Political Activity by Churches and Religious Organizations:**
    *   Enforce the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates. Ensure clear guidelines and consistent enforcement to prevent tax-exempt entities from functioning as partisan political tools.

4.  **Prevent Abuse of Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs):**
    *   Implement regulations for DAFs to require timely distribution of funds to active charities and increase transparency regarding DAF assets and grantmaking. Prevent DAFs from being used simply as tax shelters with minimal charitable impact.

5.  **Enhance IRS Enforcement Capacity:**
    *   Provide the IRS Tax-Exempt and Government Entities division with significantly increased funding and staffing to conduct regular audits, investigate potential abuses, and enforce existing tax laws related to non-profits.

6.  **Standardized Reporting and Public Access:**
    *   Modernize and standardize reporting requirements (like Form 990) for tax-exempt organizations, making the data easily accessible and searchable online for public scrutiny by researchers, journalists, and citizens.

### Protecting Legitimate Charitable Work:

These reforms are targeted at preventing abuse and ensuring accountability, particularly among large, well-funded organizations and those heavily involved in politics. We must ensure that enhanced oversight does not unduly burden smaller, community-based charities that provide essential local services. Regulations should be tiered appropriately based on organization size and activity type.

### Conclusion:

Tax-exempt status is a public trust granted in exchange for public benefit. By increasing transparency, strengthening oversight, and closing loopholes that enable political manipulation or wealth hoarding, we can ensure that tax-exempt organizations remain accountable to the public they serve. These reforms will protect the integrity of the non-profit sector and reinforce its vital role in a healthy democracy and a just society.
