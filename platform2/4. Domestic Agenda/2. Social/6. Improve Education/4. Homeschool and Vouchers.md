**Executive Summary**

The U.S. education system is fractured by inequitable resource
allocation and inconsistent accountability. This policy mandates the
elimination of private school voucher programs---a regressive mechanism
that subsidizes privilege---and institutes rigorous, non-negotiable
assessments for homeschooling to ensure all children receive equitable,
high-quality education. These measures are foundational to restoring
public education as a universal right and safeguarding student welfare.

## **Rationale**

### **Moral and Structural Imperative to Eliminate Private School Vouchers**

1.  **Moral Bankruptcy of Vouchers:**

    -   Vouchers divert \$\*\*\* billion annually from public schools to
        private institutions, which disproportionately serve affluent,
        non-disabled, and white students. This violates the principle of
        education as a public good.

    -   **Data Point:** In states with voucher expansions, public school
        funding per student dropped by 6--8% (Center on Budget and
        Policy Priorities, 2022).

2.  **Systemic Segregation:**

    -   Voucher programs deepen racial and socioeconomic divides. In
        Wisconsin, 70% of voucher recipients never attended public
        schools, subsidizing private education for families already able
        to afford it.

3.  **Accountability Vacuum:**

    -   Private schools receiving public funds are not held to federal
        anti-discrimination laws, special education mandates (IDEA), or
        standardized testing requirements.

### **Non-Negotiable Need for Homeschooling Assessments**

1.  **Educational Neglect Prevention:**

    -   Over 1.7 million homeschooled students in the U.S. lack
        guaranteed academic oversight. Mandatory assessments ensure
        alignment with state competency standards.

    -   **Data Point:** 34 states require no evaluation of homeschooled
        students; 11 states mandate no parental notification (Coalition
        for Responsible Home Education, 2023).

2.  **Child Welfare Assurance:**

    -   Homeschooling environments can conceal abuse. Annual in-person
        evaluations by trained professionals are critical to
        safeguarding children.

3.  **Parental Competency Verification:**

    -   20% of homeschooling parents lack a high school diploma.
        Mandatory certification ensures baseline pedagogical capability.

## **Policy Objectives**

1.  **Terminate all public funding for private school vouchers** by
    2025.

2.  **Institute universal mandatory homeschooling assessments** by 2026,
    including:

    -   Annual standardized testing for students.

    -   Biannual parental competency evaluations.

    -   Quarterly progress reviews for special-needs students.

## **Policy Directives**

### **A. Immediate Termination of Private School Voucher Programs**

1.  **Legislative Action:**

    -   Amend the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to prohibit federal,
        state, or local funds from subsidizing private education.

    -   Impose a 100% tax on donations to voucher-advocacy organizations
        (e.g., EdChoice, American Federation for Children).

2.  **Financial Reallocation:**

    -   Redirect \$\*\*\* billion in annual voucher funding to Title I
        schools, special education programs, and teacher salary
        increases.

3.  **Accountability Enforcement:**

    -   Require private schools accepting public funds (e.g., via
        charter agreements) to comply with IDEA, Title IX, and state
        testing mandates. Non-compliance triggers immediate defunding.

### **B. Universal Mandatory Homeschooling Assessments**

1.  **Student Evaluations:**

    -   **Annual Testing:** Mandate state-standardized exams in core
        subjects (math, science, literacy) proctored in public schools
        or licensed facilities.

    -   **Remediation Protocol:** Students scoring below proficiency
        enroll in public school tutoring programs until benchmarks are
        met.

2.  **Parental Certification:**

    -   **Competency Exams:** Require parents to pass biennial exams
        demonstrating mastery of grade-level curricula and pedagogical
        best practices.

    -   **Background Checks:** Disqualify parents with histories of
        child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence from homeschooling.

3.  **Oversight Infrastructure:**

    -   Establish a federal Homeschooling Oversight Office to coordinate
        state compliance, train assessors, and maintain national
        registries.

## **Implementation Framework**

1.  **Timeline:**

    -   **Q1 2025:** Voucher programs defunded; homeschooling assessment
        criteria finalized.

    -   **Q1 2026:** Full enforcement of homeschooling mandates.

2.  **Funding:**

    -   Reallocate 100% of voucher funds to public education and
        oversight programs.

    -   Levy penalties on non-compliant homeschooling families (up to 2%
        of household income).

3.  **Enforcement:**

    -   Withhold federal education funds from states refusing
        compliance.

    -   Deploy DOE auditors to investigate voucher misuse and
        homeschooling violations.

## **Supporting Mandates**

1.  **Public School Reinvestment:**

    -   **Class Size Caps:** 18 students per K-3 classroom; 22 for
        grades 4--12.

    -   **Teacher Salaries:** Minimum \$75,000 for K-12 educators in
        Title I districts.

2.  **Anti-Segregation Measures:**

    -   Redraw school districts using census data to maximize
        socioeconomic integration.

    -   Mandate 30% of voucher-reclaimed funds for diversity, equity,
        and inclusion (DEI) training.

3.  **Parental Support:**

    -   Free state-sponsored curricula for homeschooling families.

    -   Mandatory participation in public school extracurricular
        activities for homeschooled students.

## **Expected Outcomes**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Metric**                  **Target by 2030**
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Public school funding       +25% per student

  Homeschool proficiency      95% meet state standards

  Racial segregation index    Reduce by 40% in voucher-heavy states

  Child welfare referrals     +300% (improved abuse detection)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Countering Opposition**

1.  **"School Choice" Advocates:**

    -   **Rebuttal:** "Choice" without accountability entrenches
        inequality. Public funds must serve all students, not subsidize
        private privilege.

2.  **Homeschooling Libertarians:**

    -   **Rebuttal:** Parental rights end where child welfare begins.
        Unregulated homeschooling risks educational neglect and abuse.

3.  **Fiscal Objectors:**

    -   **Rebuttal:** Every dollar diverted to vouchers costs public
        schools \$1.50 in long-term remediation (Brookings Institution,
        2021).

## **Conclusion**

This policy rejects incrementalism. The elimination of private school
vouchers and imposition of homeschooling assessments are non-negotiable
pillars of educational justice. By reasserting the state's
responsibility to protect children and prioritize public goods over
private gain, we will dismantle systemic inequities and guarantee every
child's right to a safe, rigorous, and inclusive education.

## **Strategic Appendices**

1.  **Model Legislation:** Draft bill templates for voucher elimination
    and homeschooling oversight.

2.  **Funding Reallocation Calculator:** State-by-state breakdown of
    reclaimed voucher funds.

3.  **Compliance Metrics:** Standardized rubrics for assessing
    homeschooling environments.

**Final Note:** This policy requires uncompromising enforcement. Consult
the U.S. Department of Education's enforcement division for litigation
strategies against non-compliant states.
