## Moving Beyond Punitive Sentencing Towards Rehabilitation and Equity

Federal sentencing practices, particularly those codified or influenced by Title 18 of the U.S. Code, have significantly contributed to mass incarceration and exacerbated racial disparities within the criminal justice system. Mandatory minimum sentences, rigid sentencing guidelines, and an overemphasis on punitive measures have stripped judges of necessary discretion, led to disproportionately long sentences for non-violent offenses (especially drug-related crimes), and failed to address the root causes of criminal behavior.

Our platform calls for a fundamental overhaul of federal sentencing guidelines to prioritize justice, proportionality, rehabilitation, and equity. We must dismantle the punitive framework that has defined federal sentencing for decades and replace it with an evidence-based approach focused on reducing recidivism, addressing systemic inequalities, and promoting alternatives to incarceration.

### Key Reforms to Federal Sentencing Guidelines:

1.  **Eliminate All Federal Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Non-Violent Offenses:**
    *   Repeal statutory provisions that impose mandatory minimum prison terms, particularly for drug offenses, which disproportionately impact communities of color. These laws prevent judges from considering individual circumstances and often result in excessively harsh sentences.

2.  **Restore Judicial Discretion:**
    *   Reform the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines to be truly advisory, empowering federal judges to impose sentences below the guideline range based on mitigating factors, individual circumstances, and the goals of rehabilitation. End practices that pressure judges into adhering strictly to guideline calculations.

3.  **Promote Alternatives to Incarceration:**
    *   Direct federal courts and prosecutors to prioritize non-custodial sentences for non-violent offenses whenever appropriate. This includes expanding the use of probation, community service, restorative justice programs, drug treatment courts, and mental health diversion programs.
    *   Invest federal resources in building the capacity for these alternative programs nationwide.

4.  **Retroactive Application of Sentencing Reforms:**
    *   Apply sentencing reforms retroactively, allowing individuals currently incarcerated under outdated and overly punitive laws (like previous iterations of drug sentencing guidelines) to petition for sentence reductions. This is crucial for addressing past injustices and reducing the federal prison population.

5.  **Reduce Sentencing Enhancements and Overlapping Charges:**
    *   Reform provisions in Title 18 that allow for significant sentence enhancements based on prior convictions or specific offense characteristics, which often lead to draconian sentences.
    *   Curb the practice of "charge stacking," where prosecutors bring multiple overlapping charges for the same underlying conduct to coerce plea bargains or inflate potential sentences.

6.  **Data Collection and Disparity Analysis:**
    *   Mandate the U.S. Sentencing Commission to collect and publicly report detailed data on sentencing outcomes, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status, to identify and address unwarranted disparities.
    *   Require regular review and revision of sentencing guidelines based on empirical evidence regarding effectiveness in reducing crime and promoting public safety, rather than relying solely on punitive approaches.

### Conclusion:

Reforming federal sentencing guidelines is a critical step towards ending mass incarceration and building a more just and equitable criminal justice system. By eliminating mandatory minimums, restoring judicial discretion, prioritizing alternatives to incarceration, and addressing past injustices through retroactivity, we can move away from a purely punitive system towards one that values rehabilitation, proportionality, and fairness. These reforms, grounded in evidence and a commitment to equity, will not only reduce the human and financial costs of excessive incarceration but also enhance long-term public safety.
