# No Public Money for Public Stadiums

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that public funds should be prioritized for essential public services and infrastructure that benefit all members of the community, such as schools, healthcare, roads, and affordable housing. Subsidizing private sports teams and their stadium projects with taxpayer money is an inappropriate use of public resources that often yields limited returns for the broader community while enriching wealthy owners. Our vision is to end the practice of using public funds for private stadium development, ensuring that taxpayer money is invested in projects that provide widespread public benefit and contribute to equitable community development.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
The construction and renovation of professional sports stadiums are increasingly financed, in part or in full, by public funds through direct subsidies, tax breaks, and infrastructure investments. Proponents often argue for economic benefits like job creation and increased tax revenue, but studies frequently show that these benefits are overstated and do not outweigh the public cost. This diverts crucial resources from pressing public needs and represents a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to private team owners.

**Solutions:**
- **Enact Federal Prohibition:** Pass federal legislation prohibiting the use of federal funds, tax breaks, or loan guarantees for the construction, renovation, or maintenance of professional sports stadiums or arenas.
- **Incentivize State and Local Prohibitions:** Encourage states and local governments to enact similar prohibitions through federal matching grants for infrastructure projects that are contingent on not using public funds for stadiums.
- **Close Tax Loopholes:** Eliminate tax loopholes that allow private stadium financing to be subsidized through tax-exempt municipal bonds or other public financing mechanisms.
- **Promote Private Financing:** Advocate for professional sports leagues and team owners, who are often highly profitable, to fully finance their stadium projects with private capital.
- **Increase Transparency:** Require full transparency and public disclosure of any financial arrangements between sports teams, leagues, and government entities, including detailed cost-benefit analyses conducted by independent third parties.

## Outcome
Prohibiting the use of public money for public stadiums will free up significant taxpayer resources that can be redirected to essential public services and infrastructure projects that benefit all residents. It will ensure that wealthy sports team owners bear the financial responsibility for their private facilities and promote a more equitable distribution of public funds, leading to stronger communities and a more responsible use of taxpayer money.
