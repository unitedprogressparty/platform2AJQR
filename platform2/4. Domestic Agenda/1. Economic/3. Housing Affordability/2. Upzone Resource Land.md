## **Upzone Resource Land: A Bold Solution for Affordable Housing and a Sustainable Future**

**Introduction**

Across America, families are facing a crushing reality: housing is
simply unaffordable. In thriving urban centers and even smaller towns,
rents and home prices have spiraled out of reach, forcing individuals
into precarious living situations, long commutes, and a constant
struggle for economic stability. *Consider this:* In major metropolitan
areas, median rents now consume over 30% of the average household
income, pushing millions to the brink of housing insecurity. Meanwhile,
vast tracts of land, often designated as \"resource land\" for forestry,
agriculture, or mining, lie underutilized and zoned for low-intensity
uses, effectively locking them away from desperately needed housing
development.

This paper argues that **upzoning resource land -- strategically and
responsibly rezoning suitable areas for housing -- is not just a policy
option, but a moral and economic imperative.** It presents a powerful,
yet often overlooked, solution to unlock land for affordable housing,
promote smart growth, and build a more sustainable and equitable future
for all. By embracing this bold strategy, we can begin to reverse the
tide of the housing crisis and create communities where everyone has the
opportunity to thrive.

**What is Resource Land?**

\"Resource land\" encompasses areas primarily zoned and historically
used for resource extraction or management. This includes:

-   **Forestry Land:** Timberlands designated for harvesting and forest
    management.

-   **Agricultural Land:** Farmland and grazing areas, particularly in
    the expanding peri-urban fringe.

-   **Mining Land:** Mineral extraction sites, including brownfields
    where mining has ceased.

-   **Other Open Space:** Large undeveloped tracts, potentially buffer
    zones or historically resource-dependent areas.

Crucially, much of this resource land, especially near existing urban
areas and transportation networks, is zoned for low-density uses. This
zoning artificially restricts housing supply, driving up prices and
limiting housing choices precisely where people need them most.

**The Argument for Upzoning Resource Land: Unlocking Opportunity and
Sustainability**

Upzoning resource land for responsible housing development offers a
compelling array of benefits, creating a win-win scenario for
affordability, sustainability, and economic vitality:

-   **Directly Addressing the Housing Affordability Crisis:** The
    fundamental driver of unaffordable housing is a lack of supply.
    Studies consistently demonstrate that increasing housing supply is
    the most effective way to moderate costs. *For example, analyses
    show that a 10% increase in housing stock can lead to a 5-10%
    decrease in rents and home prices.* Strategically upzoning suitable
    resource land acts as a powerful lever to inject much-needed supply
    into constrained markets. By focusing on peri-urban resource areas,
    we can create infill and expansion opportunities that directly
    alleviate pressure in existing communities and make homeownership
    and renting attainable again for working families.

-   **Promoting Smart Growth and Combating Sprawl:** Unlike sprawling
    greenfield development that consumes pristine landscapes and
    necessitates costly new infrastructure, upzoning resource land
    allows for *smart densification*. This approach concentrates housing
    growth in areas that may already possess some infrastructure or are
    strategically positioned for cost-effective expansion. *In fact,
    research indicates that dense urban cores can reduce per capita
    infrastructure costs by as much as 30-40% compared to low-density
    sprawl.* By prioritizing resource land near existing urban areas and
    planned transit corridors, we build more walkable, bikeable, and
    transit-oriented communities, reducing car dependence and fostering
    a more connected urban fabric.

-   **Stimulating Economic Growth and Creating Diverse Job
    Opportunities:** Developing housing on upzoned resource land is a
    powerful engine for economic growth. Beyond the immediate creation
    of construction jobs and skilled trades positions (electrical,
    plumbing, HVAC), new housing developments revitalize local
    economies. Increased population density supports local businesses --
    from restaurants and shops to childcare centers and professional
    services -- creating a multiplier effect of economic activity.
    Furthermore, more affordable housing can attract businesses and
    talent to a region, fostering innovation and economic
    competitiveness. *Consider the potential: Redeveloping underutilized
    forestry land into a mixed-use community can generate not only
    construction jobs but also long-term employment in retail, services,
    and potentially even new industries attracted by the revitalized
    area.*

-   **Strategic Environmental Stewardship and Mitigation:** While any
    development has environmental impacts, upzoning resource land, when
    done *strategically and responsibly*, can actually *improve*
    environmental outcomes compared to unchecked sprawl. Our approach
    prioritizes:

    -   **Brownfield Redevelopment:** Transforming previously disturbed
        mining land or industrial forestry sites into housing not only
        provides homes but also remediates environmental damage and
        revitalizes blighted areas. *Imagine converting an abandoned
        mine site into a thriving mixed-income neighborhood with green
        spaces and restored ecosystems.*

    -   **Careful Selection of Less Sensitive Areas:** Within larger
        resource zones, we can identify and prioritize areas with lower
        ecological value for development, minimizing impacts on critical
        habitats.

    -   **Densification as an Environmental Benefit:** By concentrating
        growth and reducing sprawl, we protect vast tracts of natural
        landscapes from fragmentation and development pressure. Denser
        communities also facilitate the use of public transit, cycling,
        and walking, significantly reducing carbon footprints. *Dense
        urban cores, for example, can emit up to 50% less CO2 per capita
        than sprawling suburbs.*

    -   **Integrating Green Infrastructure and Climate Resilience:** New
        developments on upzoned land can be designed to incorporate
        green roofs, permeable pavements, urban forests, and other green
        infrastructure elements, mitigating runoff, reducing urban heat
        island effect, and enhancing biodiversity. Furthermore, building
        to climate-resilient standards (flood-resistant design,
        wildfire-resistant materials) is crucial, especially in areas
        prone to natural disasters. This directly aligns with our \"See
        climate change mitigation,\" \"Biodiversity,\" and \"Natural
        Disasters\" preparedness priorities.

**Addressing Potential Concerns Through Proactive Solutions**

We acknowledge that upzoning resource land requires careful
consideration and proactive mitigation of potential concerns. Our policy
framework directly addresses these challenges:

-   **Community Engagement, Not Opposition:** We reject the notion that
    community input is an \"obstacle\" to overcome. Instead, we embrace
    \"Robust Community Consultation\" as an *essential* element of
    successful densification. We propose:

    -   **Early and Ongoing Dialogue:** Initiating community
        conversations *before* rezoning decisions are made, ensuring
        residents are partners in shaping the future of their
        neighborhoods.

    -   **Participatory Planning Workshops and Design Charrettes:**
        Actively involving residents in design workshops and planning
        sessions to shape the character and amenities of new
        developments, fostering a sense of ownership and shared vision.

    -   **Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs):** Negotiating legally
        binding agreements between developers and communities to ensure
        that new projects deliver tangible benefits to existing
        residents, such as new parks, community centers, affordable
        units within market-rate developments, or infrastructure
        improvements.

    -   **Visualizations and Transparent Information:** Utilizing clear
        visuals, online dashboards, and accessible information sharing
        to demonstrate proposed developments, address concerns, and
        build trust.

-   

-   **Strategic and Funded Infrastructure Investment:** We recognize
    that densification requires upfront investment in infrastructure.
    Our policy framework includes a commitment to \"Strategic
    Infrastructure Investment\" and proposes concrete funding
    mechanisms:

    -   **Dedicated Infrastructure Bonds:** Issuing bonds specifically
        earmarked for infrastructure upgrades necessary to support
        densification in upzoned areas.

    -   **Development Impact Fees:** Implementing fees on new
        developments to directly fund infrastructure improvements and
        community amenities needed to accommodate growth.

    -   **Public-Private Partnerships:** Leveraging partnerships with
        the private sector to share infrastructure costs and accelerate
        project delivery.

    -   **Prioritizing Cost-Effective Infrastructure:** Focusing on
        smart infrastructure solutions that are efficient, sustainable,
        and cost-effective in the long run, such as investing in public
        transit, walkable and bikeable networks, and distributed green
        infrastructure. Densification, in fact, *reduces* long-term per
        capita infrastructure costs compared to sprawl, making this a
        fiscally sound strategy.

-   

**Policy Recommendations: A Clear Path Forward**

To effectively implement upzoning resource land and realize its full
potential, we recommend the following actionable policies:

-   **Federal Incentives and Technical Assistance for Local Zoning
    Reform:** The federal government should play a proactive role in
    encouraging and supporting zoning reform at the local level. This
    includes:

    -   **Establishing a \"Densification Grant Program\":** Offering
        competitive grants to municipalities that commit to reviewing
        and revising zoning regulations to allow for increased density
        on suitable resource land, particularly near transit and job
        centers.

    -   **Providing Model Zoning Ordinances and Best Practices Guides:**
        Developing and disseminating model zoning codes and planning
        guides that showcase best practices for upzoning resource land
        responsibly and effectively.

    -   **Offering Technical Assistance and Expertise:** Providing
        planning grants and technical expertise to local governments to
        conduct zoning reviews, engage communities, and develop
        context-sensitive densification plans.

-   

-   **State-Level Mandates and Funding for Affordable Housing on Upzoned
    Land:** State governments are crucial for setting the framework and
    providing resources for affordable housing development:

    -   **Enacting \"Fair Share Housing\" Laws:** States should mandate
        that all municipalities take responsibility for contributing to
        regional housing needs, including affordable housing, and should
        set density targets for areas near transit and job centers.

    -   **Establishing a \"State Affordable Housing Trust Fund\":**
        Creating a dedicated state fund to provide low-interest loans,
        grants, and tax credits to developers who build affordable
        housing on upzoned resource land.

    -   **Streamlining State-Level Permitting for Densification
        Projects:** Reducing bureaucratic hurdles and expediting
        state-level permits for housing projects that meet affordability
        and sustainability criteria in upzoned areas.

-   

-   **Local Governments to Embrace Proactive and Transparent Planning:**
    Local governments are on the front lines of implementation and must
    commit to:

    -   **Conducting Comprehensive Zoning Reviews:** Undertaking
        thorough reviews of zoning regulations on resource land,
        identifying areas suitable for responsible upzoning and updating
        zoning codes accordingly.

    -   **Implementing \"Inclusionary Zoning\" Policies:** Mandating
        that a percentage of units in new developments on upzoned land
        are affordable to low- and moderate-income households.

    -   **Establishing Clear and Streamlined Permitting Processes:**
        Creating predictable and efficient permitting processes for
        infill and densification projects, reducing delays and
        uncertainty for developers.

    -   **Prioritizing Community Engagement and Participatory
        Planning:** Implementing robust and ongoing community engagement
        strategies throughout the planning and development process,
        ensuring residents have a meaningful voice in shaping their
        communities.

-   

-   **Establish Metrics for Success and Ongoing Evaluation:** To ensure
    accountability and continuous improvement, we must:

    -   **Develop Clear Metrics:** Establish measurable goals for
        housing affordability, housing production, environmental impact
        (reduced sprawl, green space preservation), and community
        satisfaction related to upzoning initiatives.

    -   **Conduct Regular Policy Evaluations:** Implement bi-annual or
        annual assessments to track progress against metrics, identify
        challenges, and adapt policies as needed based on data and
        community feedback. A transparent \"Housing & Livability
        Scorecard\" can be used to publicly track progress and ensure
        accountability.
