# Shall-Issue Permitting

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that bureaucratic hurdles and discretionary permitting processes significantly contribute to housing shortages and rising costs. Adopting a "shall-issue" permitting system for housing development, where projects meeting clear, objective standards are automatically approved, will streamline construction, increase housing supply, and improve affordability. Our vision is a transparent and efficient permitting process that removes unnecessary barriers to building needed housing, accelerating the creation of homes for all income levels.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
Complex and discretionary permitting processes often lead to lengthy delays, increased development costs, uncertainty for builders, and opportunities for NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) to block needed housing. This reduces the supply of new homes, driving up prices and exacerbating the housing crisis.

**Solutions:**
- **Implement Federal Shall-Issue Mandates:** Enact federal legislation requiring local jurisdictions to adopt shall-issue permitting for housing developments that comply with pre-defined zoning and building codes.
- **Establish Clear and Objective Standards:** Develop clear, publicly accessible, and objective standards for housing design, safety, and environmental impact that, if met, guarantee permit approval.
- **Limit Discretionary Review:** Significantly reduce or eliminate discretionary review processes that allow subjective criteria or public opposition to block compliant housing projects.
- **Streamline Environmental Reviews:** Modernize and streamline environmental review processes for housing projects, focusing on significant impacts while avoiding unnecessary delays for projects with minimal environmental footprints.
- **Cap Permit Review Timelines:** Set strict, legally binding timelines for permit review and approval, with automatic approval if deadlines are missed.
- **Provide Technical Assistance to Localities:** Offer federal technical assistance and resources to local governments to help them transition to and implement shall-issue permitting systems effectively.

## Outcome
Implementing shall-issue permitting will significantly accelerate the pace of housing construction, leading to an increased supply of homes and downward pressure on housing costs. It will reduce uncertainty and costs for developers, encouraging more building. This streamlined approach will help alleviate the housing crisis, improve affordability, and contribute to more dynamic and accessible communities.
