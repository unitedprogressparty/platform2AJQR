# Agricultural Subsidies

## Philosophy and Vision
We recognize the critical role of a stable and secure food supply for national security and the well-being of our citizens. Agricultural subsidies, when designed and implemented effectively, can support farmers, ensure food affordability, promote sustainable practices, and maintain rural communities. Our vision is a system of agricultural support that prioritizes food security, environmental stewardship, fair farmer livelihoods, and resilience in the face of climate change and market volatility.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
Current agricultural subsidy programs can be complex, often disproportionately benefiting large agribusinesses, distorting markets, and sometimes incentivizing environmentally harmful practices. While intended to support farmers and food production, they can also lead to overproduction of certain commodities and make it difficult for small and new farmers to compete. The existing notes mention the political difficulty of cutting subsidies and the intention to create public agricultural intermediaries.

**Solutions:**
- **Reform Subsidy Programs:** Shift subsidies to better support small and medium-sized farms, encourage sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices, and promote diversification of crops.
- **Prioritize Food Security and Nutrition:** Link subsidies to the production of nutritious foods and ensure programs support access to healthy food for all Americans, addressing food insecurity.
- **Create Public Agricultural Intermediaries:** Establish public entities, such as regional food hubs, processing facilities, and distribution networks, to compete with private corporations, providing farmers with alternative markets and ensuring fairer prices for producers and consumers. This addresses the existing note about creating public intermediaries.
- **Support Beginning and Underserved Farmers:** Implement targeted programs and financial assistance to help new farmers, farmers of color, and other underserved populations access land, capital, and training.
- **Invest in Agricultural Research and Innovation:** Increase funding for research into sustainable farming techniques, climate-resilient crops, and efficient resource management.
- **Strengthen Crop Insurance and Disaster Assistance:** Ensure robust safety nets are in place to protect farmers from losses due to natural disasters, pests, and market fluctuations, reducing the need for ad hoc emergency aid.
- **Address Market Concentration:** Use antitrust measures to address consolidation in the agricultural sector and ensure fair competition for farmers.

## Outcome
Reforming agricultural subsidies will lead to a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable food system. Farmers will receive fairer compensation, food will be more affordable and accessible for all citizens, and rural communities will be strengthened. The creation of public intermediaries will increase competition and reduce the power of large corporations in the food supply chain.
