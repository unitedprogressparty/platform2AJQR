\*\*Acknowledging Progress, Embracing Expansion\*\*

Our commitment to a strong and vibrant economy rests on the foundation
of meaningful employment for every citizen. We recognize and commend the
valuable contributions of existing federal jobs programs that have
played a crucial role in workforce development, job placement, and
providing support to individuals seeking employment. These programs
represent a significant investment in our nation\'s human capital, and
we are committed to building upon this foundation to create even greater
opportunities for all.

\*\*Honoring Existing Frameworks\*\*

We acknowledge the important role of current federal initiatives, such
as:

\* \*\*Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Programs:\*\*
These programs provide essential pathways for adult education, job
training, and youth development, equipping individuals with the skills
needed to succeed in today\'s economy. We support the continued
strengthening and strategic allocation of WIOA funds to meet evolving
workforce demands.

\* \*\*American Job Centers (AJCs):\*\* As vital hubs for job seekers,
AJCs offer invaluable resources, including job search assistance, career
counseling, and access to training opportunities. We are dedicated to
ensuring these centers remain accessible and effective in connecting
individuals with suitable employment.

\* \*\*Apprenticeship Programs:\*\* The emphasis on \"learn while you
earn\" models through apprenticeship programs is a proven strategy for
developing skilled tradespeople and fostering long-term career pathways.
We will continue to support and expand these vital programs across
various sectors.

\* \*\*Infrastructure Investments:\*\* We recognize that federal
investments in infrastructure projects, such as those outlined in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, inherently create jobs in construction
and related industries. We will continue to prioritize infrastructure
development as a key driver of economic growth and job creation.

\* \*\*Targeted Support for Specific Populations:\*\* Programs designed
to assist veterans, individuals with disabilities, Native Americans, and
those re-entering the workforce after incarceration are crucial for
ensuring equitable access to employment opportunities. We are committed
to maintaining and enhancing these targeted support systems.

\*\*Introducing a Bold Vision: A Comprehensive Jobs Program for the 21st
Century\*\*

While we recognize the importance of these existing programs, we believe
it is time to introduce a more expansive and transformative approach to
job creation -- one that directly addresses emerging economic challenges
and proactively invests in the future of our workforce. Building upon
the principles outlined in our \"Domestic Agenda: Jobs Programs\"
document, we propose a comprehensive initiative that works in concert
with existing frameworks to ensure full employment and shared
prosperity.

This new initiative will encompass the following key components,
designed to synergize with and amplify the impact of current programs:

\* \*\*National Infrastructure Renewal Initiative:\*\* As previously
detailed, this large-scale investment in modernizing our nation\'s
infrastructure will create \*\*at least 5 million good-paying jobs over
the next decade\*\*. These jobs will span various sectors, including
construction, engineering, project management, and skilled trades like
welding, electrical work, and plumbing. We will prioritize projects
focused on sustainable infrastructure, including renewable energy
installations (solar, wind), energy-efficient transportation systems,
and upgrades to water and sewage treatment facilities. This initiative
will directly integrate with WIOA programs to provide training pathways
for individuals to acquire the necessary skills. Success will be
measured by the number of jobs created, infrastructure improvement
metrics, and reduced carbon emissions.

\* \*\*National Underground Cabling Project:\*\* This ambitious project
to enhance our digital infrastructure and ensure universal access to
high-speed internet will create \*\*an estimated 500,000 jobs over five
years\*\*. These roles will include fiber optic technicians, network
engineers, construction crews specializing in underground cabling, and
project managers. We will partner with community colleges and technical
schools through WIOA to develop specific training programs for this
growing sector. Key metrics for success include the number of jobs
created, the expansion of broadband access, and improved internet speeds
nationwide.

\* \*\*National Home Modernization and Building Program:\*\* Addressing
the pressing need for affordable housing and energy efficiency, this
program will stimulate job creation in the construction, electrical,
plumbing, and HVAC trades, aiming to create \*\*at least 1 million jobs
within seven years\*\*. Incentives will be provided for the construction
of energy-efficient homes utilizing sustainable materials and for the
retrofitting of existing homes with energy-saving technologies. This
initiative will collaborate with existing apprenticeship programs to
train a new generation of skilled construction workers and will
prioritize projects in underserved communities. Success will be measured
by the number of new affordable housing units built, the reduction in
energy consumption in modernized homes, and the creation of jobs in
these sectors.

\*\*Synergy with Universal Basic Income:\*\*

These expansive jobs programs are designed to work in tandem with our
commitment to a Universal Basic Income (UBI). While UBI provides a
crucial safety net and empowers individuals with economic security,
these job programs offer pathways to meaningful employment, skill
development, and career advancement. The combination of a UBI and robust
job creation initiatives ensures that all citizens have a foundation of
economic stability while also having access to opportunities for
personal and professional growth. This integrated approach addresses
both immediate needs and long-term economic empowerment.

\*\*Guiding Principles -- A Consistent Commitment:\*\*

The guiding principles outlined in our previous proposals remain central
to this expanded vision:

\* \*\*Living Wages and Benefits:\*\* All jobs created through these
initiatives will prioritize fair compensation, offering a living wage
with benefits such as health insurance and paid time off, reinforcing
the value of work and ensuring economic security for employees.

\* \*\*Skills Training and Apprenticeships:\*\* We will integrate robust
training and apprenticeship opportunities into these programs,
partnering with unions, community colleges, and vocational schools to
ensure that individuals have the skills necessary to thrive in these new
roles and contribute to a growing economy. This will work in conjunction
with existing apprenticeship programs to scale up training capacity and
target specific skill gaps relevant to the infrastructure, technology,
and construction sectors.

\* \*\*Prioritizing Local Communities:\*\* Hiring local workers and
sourcing materials locally will be a priority, strengthening community
economies and maximizing the local impact of these initiatives. We will
establish mechanisms to ensure equitable geographic distribution of
jobs, focusing on areas with higher unemployment rates and providing
incentives for businesses to hire locally. This approach aligns with the
goals of existing place-based economic development programs.

\* \*\*Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility:\*\* All projects
will adhere to the highest environmental standards, utilizing
sustainable materials and practices to minimize their ecological
footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future, explicitly
creating \"green jobs\" in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
sustainable construction.

\*\*Funding a Brighter Future:\*\*

These comprehensive job programs will be funded through a strategic
combination of resources, including:

\* \*\*Strategic reallocation of existing federal spending:\*\*
Prioritizing investments in these key areas, such as infrastructure and
workforce development budgets, will ensure that resources are directed
towards initiatives with the greatest potential for job creation and
economic growth.

\* \*\*Targeted bond issuances:\*\* Investing in our nation\'s
infrastructure and workforce through targeted bond issuances,
specifically designated for these job creation initiatives, will provide
the necessary capital for these ambitious projects.

\* \*\*Revenue generated through a carbon tax:\*\* As previously
proposed, revenue from a carbon tax will not only support UBI but can
also be specifically directed towards funding green jobs initiatives
within these expanded programs, ensuring a direct link between
environmental sustainability and job creation. We will also explore
closing tax loopholes that currently benefit large corporations and the
wealthy.

\* \*\*Long-term Sustainability Mechanisms:\*\* We will establish
mechanisms to ensure the long-term sustainability of these programs,
including dedicated funding streams, regular program evaluations based
on the metrics outlined above, and adaptability to evolving economic
needs.

\*\*Addressing Potential Challenges:\*\*

We recognize potential challenges, such as ensuring sufficient skilled
labor. To address this, our programs will include significant investment
in training and apprenticeship programs, working closely with unions and
educational institutions. We will also proactively address potential
geographic imbalances in job creation by targeting investments in areas
with higher unemployment and providing incentives for relocation
assistance and business development in those regions. Furthermore, we
will implement measures to prevent job displacement in other sectors by
focusing on unmet needs and emerging industries and providing retraining
opportunities for workers in potentially affected areas.

\*\*The Manufactured Problem of Unemployment:\*\*

It is imperative to acknowledge that while individual circumstances
contribute to unemployment, a significant portion of the unemployment we
face is a manufactured problem. Looking around our communities, the
sheer volume of unmet needs and undone work is undeniable. Our
infrastructure is crumbling, our homes need modernization for energy
efficiency, and the transition to a sustainable economy requires a
massive workforce. There is an abundance of work that needs to be done
-- from caring for our aging population and educating our children to
building a resilient and sustainable infrastructure and advancing
scientific research. The fact that individuals are willing and able to
work, yet lack opportunities, points to systemic failures and a mismatch
between available labor and investment in necessary projects. Our
comprehensive jobs program directly addresses this manufactured scarcity
by strategically investing in areas where there is clear societal need,
thereby creating meaningful employment opportunities and empowering
individuals to contribute their skills and talents. We are not simply
creating make-work; we are strategically investing in projects that will
improve our nation\'s infrastructure, environment, and the well-being of
our citizens.

\*\*The Impact of AI and Automation: Embracing Change and Ensuring
Opportunity\*\*

We recognize that the accelerating pace of Artificial Intelligence and
automation has the potential to significantly reshape our economy. While
these technologies offer exciting possibilities for increased
productivity and innovation, we must proactively address the potential
for widespread job displacement. Our comprehensive jobs program is
designed to be adaptable to this changing landscape. By focusing on
infrastructure development, technological upgrades, and home
modernization -- sectors that will continue to require significant human
labor even with automation -- we are creating a strong foundation of
employment opportunities. Furthermore, we will invest heavily in
retraining and upskilling programs to equip workers with the skills
needed for emerging industries and roles that complement automation.
This includes focusing on areas requiring uniquely human skills such as
critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex
problem-solving. We also believe that as automation handles more routine
tasks, it creates an opportunity to explore a shorter work week,
allowing more people to participate in the workforce without reducing
overall productivity. Our commitment to Universal Basic Income serves as
a vital safety net during this transition, ensuring economic security
for all while individuals adapt to the evolving job market. We believe
that with thoughtful planning and investment, AI and automation can be
forces for progress that benefit all members of society, not just a
select few.

\*\*Job Guarantees and Our Political Philosophy:\*\*

Our commitment to these expansive jobs programs directly reflects the
principles outlined in our \"Political Philosophy\" and \"Comprehensive
Bill of Rights.\" While our Bill of Rights does not explicitly state a
\"job guarantee\" in those exact words, it emphatically affirms the
\*\*\"Right to Economic Participation,\"\*\* the \*\*\"Right to Basic
Human Needs\"\*\* (including access to necessities often secured through
employment), and the importance of \*\*\"Equal Opportunity.\"\*\* Our
proposed jobs programs are the concrete manifestation of these rights.
By actively creating meaningful employment opportunities, we are
ensuring that individuals can exercise their right to participate in the
economy and secure their basic needs with dignity. The philosophy
underpinning our belief in government\'s role as a protector and
promoter of justice necessitates active intervention to address the
manufactured problem of unemployment. These programs are not merely
about charity; they are about upholding the fundamental rights of every
citizen to contribute to society and share in its prosperity. We believe
that a just government has a responsibility to create the conditions
where these rights can be fully realized, and our comprehensive jobs
program is a critical step in fulfilling that responsibility.

\*\*Building Bipartisan Support:\*\*

We are committed to building bipartisan support for these initiatives by
highlighting the shared benefits of job creation, infrastructure
improvement, a stronger economy, and a more secure future for all
Americans in the face of technological change. These programs will be
framed as essential investments in America\'s future, transcending
partisan divides and appealing to a broad range of stakeholders who
recognize the need for a robust and adaptable workforce.

\*\*Conclusion: A Unified Vision for Prosperity and Full Employment in
the Age of Innovation\*\*

We believe that by building upon the successes of existing federal jobs
programs and introducing these new, expansive initiatives, we can create
a truly prosperous and equitable future for all. This comprehensive
approach, working in conjunction with our commitment to a Universal
Basic Income, will ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to
contribute to our economy, build a secure future, and share in the
benefits of a thriving nation, even amidst the transformative changes
brought by AI and automation. This is not simply about creating jobs;
it\'s about strategically investing in our people, strengthening our
communities, building a resilient and adaptable economy, directly
addressing the manufactured problem of unemployment, and upholding the
fundamental rights of every American. This is a vision of full
employment, shared prosperity, and a future where technological
advancements empower us all.
