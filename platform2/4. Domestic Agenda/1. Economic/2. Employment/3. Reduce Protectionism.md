# Reduce Protectionism

## Philosophy and Vision
We envision a global economy characterized by fair trade, open markets, and mutually beneficial international cooperation. Reducing protectionist measures, such as excessive tariffs, distorting subsidies, and restrictive licensing, fosters greater economic efficiency, innovation, and consumer choice. Our goal is to create a level playing field for businesses and workers, both domestically and internationally, promoting sustainable growth and shared prosperity across borders.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
Protectionist policies, while sometimes intended to shield domestic industries, can lead to retaliatory measures, higher costs for consumers, reduced competition, and stifled innovation. They can also harm export-oriented industries and limit access to global markets.

**Solutions:**
- **Negotiate and Reduce Tariffs:** Engage in multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations to systematically lower tariffs on goods and services, promoting freer flow of trade.
- **Eliminate Harmful Subsidies:** Work to identify and eliminate subsidies that distort international trade and create unfair advantages for domestic industries.
- **Streamline Licensing and Regulations:** Review and reform overly complex or restrictive licensing requirements and regulations that act as non-tariff barriers to trade.
- **Promote Fair Labor and Environmental Standards:** Ensure that trade agreements include strong provisions for labor rights and environmental protection to prevent a race to the bottom and promote responsible global practices.
- **Invest in Domestic Competitiveness:** Complement trade liberalization with investments in domestic education, infrastructure, and innovation to help domestic industries compete effectively in a global market.
- **Provide Adjustment Assistance:** Offer support and retraining programs for workers and communities negatively impacted by shifts in trade patterns.

## Outcome
Reducing protectionism will lead to increased trade volumes, lower prices for consumers, and greater efficiency in resource allocation globally. Domestic industries will be incentivized to innovate and become more competitive. This approach fosters stronger international relationships and contributes to global economic stability and growth.
