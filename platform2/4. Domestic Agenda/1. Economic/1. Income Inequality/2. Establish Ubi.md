Party Platform Proposal: Universal Basic Income (UBI)
Policy Statement
Our party advocates for a Universal Basic Income: a guaranteed, regular cash payment for all adult citizens, without conditions or means testing. By ensuring that everyone can afford essentials such as shelter, food, and healthcare, this policy aims to eliminate the fear of homelessness and financial desperation, thereby creating a more resilient and inclusive society.

Key Objectives
Eradicate Poverty and Guarantee Basic Security

UBI ensures that no individual falls below a baseline level of economic well-being.
By eliminating extreme poverty, we simultaneously reduce many secondary costs associated with poor health, low educational attainment, and homelessness.
Promote Equitable Economic Growth

Providing every adult with a consistent income empowers local economies, as more individuals have reliable purchasing power.
Widespread consumer confidence strengthens small businesses and fosters a more balanced, diverse marketplace.
Streamline Social Support Systems

Transitioning to a single, universal payment can reduce the complexity and duplication inherent in fragmented welfare programs.
Without sudden benefit cutoffs when income increases (the so-called “assistance cliff”), people can confidently pursue better jobs, promotions, or entrepreneurial ventures.
Adapt to Technological Changes and Automation

As advances in technology displace certain types of work, UBI functions as a safeguard, ensuring that workers can afford to retrain or pivot into emerging industries.
This financial cushion nurtures innovation and entrepreneurship, cultivating a flexible, future-ready workforce.
Rebalance Power Between Workers and Employers

With a guaranteed income floor, employees are better positioned to seek fair wages and safer working conditions.
UBI prevents corporations from exploiting workers’ fear of losing everything, creating a healthier dynamic between labor and management.
Funding Mechanism
Progressive Income Taxes

Those who benefit the most from our economy contribute proportionally more to sustain this foundational social contract.
Carbon Tax

A levy on activities that damage the environment both raises funds for UBI and encourages sustainable industry practices.
These funding streams can be refined through legislative processes to guarantee stability and fairness over the long term.

Expected Outcomes
Greater Economic Stability
By placing additional spending power in the hands of citizens, local economies experience more consistent demand, buffering them against external shocks.
Expanded Social Mobility
Reliable financial support frees individuals to invest in education or start small businesses, thus breaking cycles of intergenerational poverty and underemployment.
Forward-Looking Society
A safety net against rapid technological shifts allows communities to embrace innovation without sacrificing the well-being of their most vulnerable members.
Empowered Workforce
Workers can negotiate fair terms or venture into creative fields, knowing that a baseline of financial security is guaranteed.
Conclusion
By implementing Universal Basic Income, we create the conditions for a society that is both prosperous and just. The assurance of a consistent, unconditional income eliminates fear-driven decisions, enables personal and professional development, and prepares us for the shifting landscape of work in a rapidly evolving economy. This proposal reaffirms our commitment to collective well-being, individual dignity, and true economic freedom for every citizen.
