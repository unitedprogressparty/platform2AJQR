title: "         3. Surplus extraction (corporate)"
---



## I. Summary
This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to address corporate surplus extraction through diversified ownership structures, public options, robust antitrust mechanisms, equitable tax reforms, and strategic housing initiatives. A key enhancement is the **Shared-Risk Employee Equity Pool**—a private, employee-centered “mutual fund” that spreads risk among workers’ equity stakes, preventing Enron-style collapses. By combining this innovative ownership model with the other measures outlined here, we aim to foster a more resilient, fair, and inclusive economy.

---

## II. Background and Rationale
Corporate concentration, tax avoidance, and skyrocketing inequality have underscored the need for policies that broaden ownership, curb monopolistic behavior, and ensure corporations contribute fairly to the public good. Traditional employee stock ownership can expose workers to significant single-company risk; to address this, we introduce a shared-risk framework. By pooling and diversifying employee equity across one or more firms, we protect against catastrophic losses while sustaining the incentive and morale benefits of employee ownership.

## III. Policy Pillars

### 1. Diffusify Ownership  
1. **Objective**  
   - Broaden corporate ownership to reduce wealth concentration, encourage worker engagement, and stabilize local economies.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)**  
     - Mandate or incentivize the creation of ESOPs, ensuring employees have a direct stake in corporate growth and governance.  
   - **Cooperative Models and Incentives**  
     - Provide tax breaks and grants for businesses transitioning into worker cooperatives, including multi-stakeholder models.  
   - **Shared-Risk Employee Equity Pool**  
     - **Conceptual Framework Summary**:  
       - Create a **private, employee-focused “mutual fund”** entity that pools ownership stakes from one or multiple employee-owned companies.  
       - Each worker holds “units” in the pool rather than direct shares in a single firm, substantially **reducing single-company risk**.  
       - A board of trustees or fiduciaries manages valuations, oversees periodic liquidity windows, and ensures transparent governance.  
       - Employees can trade or redeem these units at set intervals, accessing liquidity without exposing the entire enterprise to market volatility.  
       - Caps on exposure to any single firm (or partial diversification into external, low-risk assets) prevent “Enron-style” collapse scenarios.  

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Ensures employees aren’t left vulnerable if one company fails.  
   - **Broader Wealth Distribution**: Promotes stable, inclusive economic growth where more people share in corporate success.  
   - **Sustained Worker Ownership Ethos**: Retains the sense of collective stake and motivation that employee ownership provides.

### 2. Establish One Public Option per Major Industry  
1. **Objective**  
   - Introduce government-backed enterprises in essential sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance, housing) to create competitive pressure, ensure accessibility, and deter oligopolistic practices.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Legislative Framework**: Authorize the formation of public options in targeted industries where consumers suffer from monopolistic pricing or inadequate service.  
   - **Funding Sources**: Blend revenues from new or existing taxes (e.g., financial services tax) with government bonds.  
   - **Independent Oversight**: Establish transparent governance bodies to manage each public option’s daily operations.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Consumer Protection**: Lower prices, improved services, and diversified market offerings.  
   - **Democratic Accountability**: Public options can prioritize social welfare, not just profit.

### 3. Antitrust Laws and Public Options  
1. **Objective**  
   - Strengthen antitrust regulation and leverage public options to sustain healthy market competition.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Broader Merger Review Authority**: Empower agencies to block deals that reinforce monopolistic structures or undermine market competition.  
   - **Public Option as a Balance**: Deploy public enterprises to act as safeguards against predatory pricing or supply constraints.  
   - **Cross-Sector Collaboration**: Streamline data-sharing and enforcement actions between public entities and antitrust regulators.
   - Companies found guilty of anti competive behaviour will be nationalised.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Market Dynamism**: More room for innovation, startups, and small businesses.  
   - **Consumer and Worker Protections**: Reduced exploitation and better labor practices under fairer competitive conditions.

### 4. Reduce AMT Cutoff and Rate  
1. **Objective**  
   - Recalibrate the Alternative Minimum Tax to encompass more corporate entities, ensuring a fair minimum contribution.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Lower Thresholds**: Adjust the AMT cutoff so additional profitable corporations fall under its scope.  
   - **Graduated Rates**: Introduce tiered rates to ensure corporations of varying sizes pay an equitable baseline.  
   - **Close Loopholes**: Limit excessive deductions that previously allowed corporations to circumvent the AMT.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Greater Fairness**: Aligns corporate tax burdens more closely with actual earnings.  
   - **Sustainable Revenue**: Increases government funds for infrastructure, education, and other public goods.

### 5. Address Offshoring (Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich)  
1. **Objective**  
   - Combat multinational profit-shifting schemes that erode domestic tax bases.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Global Coordination**: Lead or join international treaties harmonizing minimum corporate tax rates.  
   - **Transparent Reporting**: Mandate country-by-country disclosures to expose profit-shifting patterns.  
   - **Penalties and Market-Access Restrictions**: Enforce strong punitive measures for corporations persistently engaged in aggressive offshoring.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Level Playing Field**: Reduces artificial competitive advantages gained through tax avoidance.  
   - **Strengthened Public Finances**: Recaptures billions in lost tax revenue for societal investments.

### 6. Financial Services Tax and High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Tax  
1. **Objective**  
   - Capture revenue from under-taxed financial transactions and limit destabilizing speculative trading.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Financial Services Tax**: Levy modest fees on financial transactions (stock, bond, derivatives trades) to generate public revenue.  
   - **HFT Tax**: Impose a small-percentage charge on high-frequency trades to deter flash trading that heightens volatility.  
   - **Targeted Allocation**: Earmark proceeds for public infrastructure, social programs, or funding public options.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Fairer Contribution from Finance**: The financial sector pays its share toward public services.  
   - **Reduced Market Turbulence**: Dampens short-term speculation that can trigger systemic risks.

### 7. End Religious Tax Exemptions  
1. **Objective**  
   - Rectify inequities in the tax code by removing blanket exemptions for religious institutions engaged in profit-generating activities.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Revised Eligibility**: Restrict exemptions to purely charitable or community-focused services, regardless of religious affiliation.  
   - **Transparent Reporting**: Require financial disclosures for any commercial arms or revenue-generating properties.  
   - **Fair Enforcement**: Enforce these rules equally across all organizations, with sufficient oversight and auditing.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Consistent Tax Policy**: Prevent religious or pseudo-religious entities from operating as untaxed businesses.  
   - **Revenue Gains**: Free up additional funds for public priorities without stifling genuine charity.

2. **Key Measures**  
   - **Zoning Reforms**: Streamline local, state, and federal regulations to allow higher-density, mixed-use construction.  
   - **Permitting Overhaul**: Simplify and expedite the application and review process for new housing projects.  
   - **Incentives for Affordability**: Provide tax credits or grants to developers offering below-market-rate units.

3. **Intended Outcomes**  
   - **Lower Housing Costs**: Increased supply curbs price spikes in high-demand areas.  
   - **Social and Economic Vitality**: Healthier communities with better access to jobs, schools, and amenities.

## IV. Implementation Strategy

1. **Legislative Package**  
   - Craft an integrated suite of bills that incorporates shared-risk equity pools, tax reform, antitrust updates, public option authorization, and housing policies.

2. **Inter-Agency Collaboration**  
   - Form task forces bridging the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Justice, and Housing to coordinate regulations and enforcement across all policy pillars.

3. **Public Engagement**  
   - Run broad outreach campaigns, inviting feedback from stakeholders such as labor unions, cooperatives, small businesses, and community groups.

4. **Phased Rollout**  
   - Prioritize popular or quickly impactful measures (e.g., shared-risk equity pools, AMT adjustments) before tackling more contentious reforms (e.g., ending religious tax exemptions).
