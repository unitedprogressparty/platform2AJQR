## Ensuring Every Voice is Heard: A Foundation for Democracy

The right to vote is the cornerstone of American democracy, yet it is under sustained attack across the country. Efforts to suppress votes, particularly targeting communities of color, young people, low-income individuals, and citizens with disabilities, undermine the fundamental principle of equal representation and threaten the legitimacy of our elections. Gerrymandering further distorts representation, allowing politicians to choose their voters rather than the other way around.

Our platform advocates for comprehensive federal action to protect and expand voting rights for all eligible citizens, eliminate barriers to participation, and ensure that our elections are free, fair, accessible, and secure. We must counteract voter suppression tactics and modernize our voting systems to reflect the values of an inclusive 21st-century democracy.

### Key Pillars for Protecting and Expanding Voting Rights:

1.  **Restore and Strengthen the Voting Rights Act (VRA):**
    *   Pass federal legislation, such as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to restore the full protections of the VRA, including reinstating federal preclearance requirements for states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting practices. This ensures that changes to voting laws cannot disproportionately harm minority voters without federal review.

2.  **Establish National Standards for Voter Access:**
    *   Enact federal legislation, like the Freedom to Vote Act, to establish minimum national standards for voting access, including:
        *   **Automatic Voter Registration (AVR):** Automatically register eligible citizens to vote when they interact with government agencies (like the DMV), unless they opt out.
        *   **Online Voter Registration:** Ensure all states offer secure online voter registration.
        *   **Same-Day Voter Registration:** Allow eligible voters to register and vote on Election Day.
        *   **Early Voting:** Guarantee a minimum period of early in-person voting (e.g., at least two weeks) in all federal elections, including weekend options.
        *   **No-Excuse Absentee/Mail-in Voting:** Ensure all voters have the option to vote by mail without needing a specific excuse, with accessible ballot return options (e.g., drop boxes, prepaid postage).
        *   **Voter ID Laws:** Prohibit strict photo ID requirements that disproportionately burden certain voters. Allow a broad range of identification documents and a sworn affidavit option.

3.  **End Partisan Gerrymandering:**
    *   Mandate the use of independent, non-partisan redistricting commissions for drawing congressional district lines in all states. Establish clear, objective criteria for redistricting (e.g., contiguity, compactness, respect for communities of interest, compliance with the VRA) that prohibit maps drawn for partisan advantage or to dilute minority voting strength. (See also section 4.4 Legislative Reform).

4.  **Restore Voting Rights for Formerly Incarcerated Citizens:**
    *   Enact federal legislation to automatically restore voting rights to citizens upon release from incarceration for felony convictions. End felony disenfranchisement laws that disproportionately affect communities of color and prevent millions of citizens from participating in democracy.

5.  **Make Election Day a National Holiday:**
    *   Designate federal Election Day as a national holiday to reduce barriers related to work schedules and make it easier for all citizens to cast their ballots.

6.  **Combat Voter Intimidation and Deceptive Practices:**
    *   Strengthen federal laws prohibiting voter intimidation, harassment, and the spread of election-related disinformation designed to suppress votes. Enhance enforcement penalties for such activities.

7.  **Ensure Accessible Polling Places:**
    *   Mandate that all polling places are fully accessible to voters with disabilities and provide adequate resources, including accessible voting machines and language assistance for non-English speaking voters, as required by law. Ensure equitable distribution of polling places and voting machines to prevent long lines, particularly in underserved communities.

### Conclusion:

Protecting and expanding the right to vote is essential for the health and legitimacy of our democracy. By enacting comprehensive federal standards, restoring the Voting Rights Act, ending gerrymandering, and eliminating discriminatory barriers, we can ensure that every eligible American has the freedom to vote and that our elections truly reflect the will of the people. Voter suppression in any form is antithetical to democratic values and must be eradicated.
