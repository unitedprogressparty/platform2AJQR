## Investing in Science to Understand and Mitigate Environmental Threats

Addressing complex environmental challenges—from climate change and biodiversity loss to pollution and resource scarcity—requires a foundation of robust scientific research, continuous monitoring, and proactive assessment of emerging risks. Sound environmental policy must be guided by the best available science, demanding sustained federal investment in research and development across multiple disciplines.

Our platform prioritizes strengthening the nation's capacity for environmental research, ensuring scientific integrity, promoting open data access, and critically evaluating novel technologies, including potentially high-risk interventions like geoengineering.

### Key Priorities for Environmental Research:

1.  **Boost Funding for Climate Science:**
    *   Significantly increase federal funding for climate change research through agencies like NOAA, NASA, NSF, DOE, and EPA. Focus on improving climate modeling (especially regional impacts), understanding tipping points, advancing carbon cycle science, and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

2.  **Expand Biodiversity Research and Monitoring:**
    *   Invest in comprehensive biodiversity assessments, long-term ecological monitoring networks, and research into ecosystem resilience, restoration techniques, and the impacts of environmental stressors (climate change, pollution, invasive species). (See also section 3.5).

3.  **Research into Pollution Prevention and Remediation:**
    *   Fund research into identifying, tracking, and mitigating persistent pollutants (e.g., PFAS, microplastics), developing safer chemical alternatives, and advancing cost-effective remediation technologies for contaminated sites (air, water, soil).

4.  **Sustainable Resource Management Research:**
    *   Support research on sustainable water management, soil health, sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, and the development of circular economy approaches to minimize resource depletion and waste.

5.  **Ensure Scientific Integrity and Open Data:**
    *   Protect federal scientists from political interference and ensure that scientific findings are communicated transparently to the public and policymakers.
    *   Mandate open access policies for federally funded environmental research data to facilitate collaboration, verification, and innovation.

6.  **Critically Evaluate Emerging Technologies and Risks:**
    *   **Geoengineering Research Governance:** While prioritizing emissions reductions and adaptation, support cautious, transparent, and internationally coordinated research into the *risks and potential efficacy* of proposed geoengineering technologies (like solar radiation management or carbon dioxide removal). This research must be governed by strict ethical guidelines and focus primarily on understanding potential unintended consequences (e.g., impacts on weather patterns, ecosystems, ozone layer, potential for "termination shock") before any consideration of deployment. Establish a moratorium on large-scale deployment until risks, benefits, and governance frameworks are thoroughly understood and internationally agreed upon.
    *   **Other Emerging Risks:** Proactively fund research into other emerging environmental risks, such as the long-term impacts of nanotechnology, synthetic biology, or widespread AI deployment on ecosystems and resource use.

### Conclusion:

A strong commitment to environmental research is fundamental to navigating the complex challenges of the 21st century. By investing in science, ensuring its integrity, promoting open data, and critically evaluating new technologies and risks like geoengineering, we can develop effective, evidence-based policies to protect our environment, build resilience, and secure a sustainable future.
