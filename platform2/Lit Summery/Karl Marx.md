Modern production arrangements can deliver substantial economic growth,
but they rest on a fundamental injustice. When only a small group owns
the tools, resources, and investment capital---while the majority has
little more than their labor to sell---it is plainly unethical and
undermines any claim to fairness. Although markets may appear to
function under equal agreements, the concentration of productive power
and profit in the hands of a few creates a systemic imbalance that
disadvantages most workers. Even when such a setup drives productivity,
it does so by entrenching disparities, as owners compete at the expense
of those who do the actual work.

Central to this arrangement is the fact that fresh value is generated by
the labor individuals invest in converting resources into goods. A
fraction of this input is compensated through wages, while a
considerable surplus stays with those who finance or possess the means
of production. Over the long run, these accumulated earnings drive
expansions, spark new technologies, and intensify the race to undercut
competitors. Yet the drive to maximize profits carries within it the
tendency to slash labor costs, relocate production, or jettison
employees when margins shrink. This dynamic creates persistent
uncertainty for working people, who can be displaced without warning or
see their earnings stagnate if it serves the interests of capital. These
structural traits are inherent to capitalism, whose pursuit of
ever-higher returns generates periodic bouts of overproduction,
declining profitability, and economic turmoil. When crises erupt, some
enterprises close down while others seize opportunities to buy
distressed assets cheaply, sharpening the divide between those who
control production and those who must labor for them.

By empowering employees to co-own the enterprise---whether through
cooperative structures or transparent public institutions---people gain
genuine influence over strategic choices and financial returns. In
parallel, policies like fair tax systems and stronger social protections
can mitigate inequalities, ensuring broader access to education,
healthcare, and housing. Together, these measures aim to distribute the
gains of economic activity more evenly, reduce vulnerability to
boom-bust cycles, and create conditions that balance productivity and
well-being across the wider community.
