# Introduction  
Aleksandr Dugin’s *Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia* (1997) is a 600-page treatise outlining a grand strategy for Russia’s resurgence as a global power ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%20)). The book became influential among Russian military and policy elites – reportedly used as a textbook at the Academy of the General Staff – reflecting Dugin’s ultra-nationalist, neo-Eurasianist vision ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=book%20by%20Aleksandr%20Dugin%20,6)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=police%20forces%20%2C%20and%20,6)). Written in the turbulent post-Soviet 1990s, Dugin’s work proposed a radical reordering of world politics. He draws on classical geopolitical theories (Mackinder’s “Heartland,” Haushofer’s pan-regions, etc.) to argue that a Eurasian land-power (led by Russia) must unite to defeat the “Atlantic” maritime powers (the United States and its allies) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Atlanticists%2C%20Dugin%20claims%2C%20are%20the,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). In essence, *Foundations of Geopolitics* is both a survey of geopolitics and a strategic manifesto. It is organized into multiple parts and chapters that first review past geopolitical theories, then outline modern “Atlanticist” (Western) dominance, and finally present Dugin’s prescription for a Russian-led Eurasian empire. The following analysis provides a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of Dugin’s main claims and arguments (with his assumptions and evidence), examines the geopolitical theories he invokes and adapts, evaluates the logic and contradictions of his ideas, and discusses the historical context and real-world implications – including case studies of similar strategies and their outcomes – all while referencing academic critiques of Dugin’s positions.  

# Chapter-by-Chapter Breakdown  

## Part I: Classical Geopolitical Thinkers (Ch. 1–10)  
**Chapter 1 – “Friedrich Ratzel: States as Spatial Organisms”:** Dugin opens by invoking Friedrich Ratzel, a 19th-century German geographer often considered a founding father of geopolitics. Ratzel viewed states as living organisms that grow and struggle for space (influencing the concept of *Lebensraum*) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%201%2023%20Friedrich%20Ratzel,25)). Dugin summarizes Ratzel’s idea that a nation’s strength correlates with territorial expansion, implying that Russia, too, must expand or risk decline. He notes Ratzel’s assumption that geography and territory fundamentally shape a state’s destiny. This chapter sets an expansionist tone: Dugin accepts the premise that *state power = spatial control*, using Ratzel’s quasi-Darwinist analogy as a foundational assumption for his own arguments.  

**Chapter 2 – “Rudolf Kjellén and Friedrich Naumann: Middle Europe”:** Dugin next discusses Rudolf Kjellén (a Swedish political scientist who coined the term “geopolitics”) and Friedrich Naumann, focusing on their concept of *Mitteleuropa* (Central or Middle Europe) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%202%2029%20Rudolf%20Schellen,30)). Kjellén built on Ratzel’s ideas, treating the state as a geographic organism with natural “life cycles,” while Naumann envisioned a German-led Central European bloc. Dugin highlights how early 20th-century thinkers saw blocs of nations (especially a German-centric Europe) as geopolitical units. He underscores assumptions of that era: that cultural-geographic unity (e.g. a pan-German sphere) was essential for survival against rival powers. By recounting these ideas, Dugin is laying groundwork to justify regional hegemonies. He points out Kjellén’s and Naumann’s “new science” of geopolitik aimed to serve national interests ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%202%2029%20Rudolf%20Schellen,30)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%2033%20Halford%20Mackinder,34)), drawing a parallel to his own goal of forging a Eurasian bloc to serve Russian interests.  

**Chapter 3 – “Halford Mackinder: The Geographical Axis of History”:** This chapter examines Sir Halford Mackinder’s famous Heartland Theory. Mackinder argued in 1904 that control of the “Heartland” of Eurasia (essentially Central Asia and Russia) would be pivotal to commanding the “World-Island” (Eurasia plus Africa) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%20Halford%20Mackinder%20%E2%80%9DThe,is%20the%20brightest%20figure%20among)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20Vidal%20de%20la,the%20founder%20of%20the%20French)). Dugin highlights Mackinder’s aphorism: “Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; who rules the World-Island commands the world.” He explains Mackinder’s dichotomy of land power vs. sea power – the idea of a perennial struggle between continental empires and maritime empires. Dugin clearly adopts this framework, identifying Russia as the Heartland power and the U.S./UK as the leading sea powers (the “Atlanticists”). He notes Mackinder’s assumptions about geography’s immutable strategic value and emphasizes the strategic *“pivot area”* of Eurasia ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). By reviewing Mackinder, Dugin provides intellectual backing for a Russia-centric “world empire” based on dominating the core of Eurasia. (He will later use this theory to argue that Russia *must* prevent Western encirclement of the Heartland ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)).)  

**Chapter 4 – “Alfred Mahan: Sea Power”:** Dugin then turns to Alfred Thayer Mahan, the American naval historian who championed the importance of sea power. Mahan argued that naval superiority and control of sea lanes were key to national greatness (influencing U.S. and British strategy in the 19th–20th centuries). Dugin summarizes Mahan’s view that maritime nations form a distinct “thalassocratic” (sea-power) civilization focused on trade and naval dominance ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). He contrasts this with the “tellurocratic” (land-power) civilization of the Heartland. This chapter reinforces the land vs. sea dichotomy: Dugin uses Mahan as the archetype of Atlanticist strategy, noting how Britain and later the U.S. used naval power and alliances to contain continental rivals. The implied lesson for Russia is that it faces an historically proven adversary in Anglo-American sea power, and thus must respond by strengthening its land power unity. Mahan’s emphasis on commerce and a liberal maritime order is portrayed as the antithesis of the traditionalist, autarkic land order that Dugin prefers.  

**Chapter 5 – “Paul Vidal de la Blache: France versus Germany”:** Here Dugin examines the French geographer Vidal de la Blache and the concept of *possibilism* in geography. Vidal de la Blache studied how geographic environment offers possibilities rather than rigid determinism, and he emphasized regional diversity (in contrast to the German deterministic approach). Dugin likely highlights France’s geopolitical situation vis-à-vis Germany – e.g. the rivalry and balance between a land-oriented continental power (Germany) and a state with maritime outlets and colonial interests (France). He notes Vidal’s arguments about France’s natural frontiers and the need to counter German expansion ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%2047%20Vidal%20de,48)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%208%2063%20Karl%20Schmitt,65)). Through this, Dugin illustrates another facet of European geopolitics: the tension between national particularism and larger continental blocs. He uses the Franco-German rivalry as a precursor to the idea that Europe could either remain divided (which Atlanticists exploit) or unite under a continental alliance. Dugin’s assumption here is that Europe has an “anti-Atlanticist tradition” in powers like France and Germany that Russia can tap into ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Germany,extraterritorial%20floating)). He cites Vidal’s focus on geographic limits to caution that culture and geography can resist domination – implying Russia must be sensitive in how it incorporates Europe into its grand design.  

**Chapter 6 – “Nicholas Spykman: The Rimland and the Revision of Mackinder”:** Dugin next discusses Nicholas Spykman, a mid-20th-century strategist who amended Mackinder’s theory. Spykman argued that the coastal “Rimland” around Eurasia (from Western Europe through the Middle East to East Asia) was actually the key to controlling Eurasia, coining the phrase “Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia…” as a counter to Mackinder ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Spykman’s ideas informed U.S. Cold War containment strategy – the “cordon sanitaire” of allies and buffer states encircling the Soviet Union from the Baltic to the Balkans ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Dugin emphasizes how Atlanticists (the West) used this strategy to hem in Russia. He notes Spykman’s influence on creating NATO, alliances in East Asia, etc., which Dugin sees as an ongoing threat to Russia’s sphere. The chapter underlines the assumption that Western powers will always try to contain any Heartland power by controlling the Rimland. Dugin uses this to justify his own strategy of “breaking” the Rimland containment. For example, he explicitly aims to *push Britain out of Europe and draw France away from NATO, while absorbing Eastern Europe into a Russian-European bloc*, thereby smashing the Atlantic “buffer zone” ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=threats%20to%20its%20objectives%20in,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=between%20Russia%20and%20the%20West%E2%80%94from,is%20not%20all%20that%20fantastical)). Spykman’s work is thus presented as both a warning (of what the West is doing) and an instructive blueprint (of what Russia must counter).  

**Chapter 7 – “Karl Haushofer: Continental Bloc”:** Dugin then profiles Karl Haushofer, a German geopolitician of the interwar period who promoted the idea of *Pan-regions* and a German-Russian-Japanese “continental bloc.” Haushofer believed Germany’s best chance for world power was to ally with Russia (and even Japan) to form a Eurasian land bloc that could challenge British and American sea power ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L2000%20Chapter%207,Karl%20Haushofer%20Continental%20Bloc)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Dugin is clearly inspired by this notion. In this chapter he recounts Haushofer’s arguments that the Eurasian continent should be unified against maritime empires, and that ideological differences (even between fascist Germany, communist Russia, and imperial Japan) could be set aside for geopolitical unity. Dugin notes Haushofer’s role in shaping Nazi geopolitics and his concept of *Lebensraum* (living space) for Germany, though Dugin adapts the idea toward Russia’s needs. The “Continental Bloc” idea – essentially a *Moscow-Berlin-Tokyo axis* – is taken by Dugin as a precursor to his own Eurasian alliance vision ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). He acknowledges the historical outcome (Germany instead invaded Russia in WWII, and the alliance failed), but uses Haushofer’s theory to argue it was a missed opportunity. The assumption Dugin forwards is that in the post-Soviet world, Russia can now pursue this continental coalition properly, learning from past mistakes. Haushofer’s emphasis on geographic alliances over ideology becomes a key pillar in Dugin’s strategy of uniting disparate powers (e.g. democratic Germany, theocratic Iran, perhaps even Japan) against the common Anglo-American foe.  

**Chapter 8 – “Carl Schmitt: ‘Hippo’ (Land) versus ‘Leviathan’ (Sea)”:** In this chapter, Dugin draws on the legal and political theorist Carl Schmitt. Schmitt (a Nazi-era jurist) wrote about the concept of Großraum (greater space) and the rivalry of land and sea symbolized by the mythical beasts “Behemoth/Hippo” (land) and “Leviathan” (sea). Dugin highlights Schmitt’s view of international law as rooted in spatial order – each major power should have its own regional domain free from outside intervention ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%208%2063%20Karl%20Schmitt,65)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=8,65)). He also references Schmitt’s friend-enemy distinction: defining politics by the identification of a clear existential enemy. Dugin uses Schmitt to give philosophical depth to the land-sea dichotomy – portraying it as a fundamental metaphysical struggle between continental *Telluric* civilization and oceanic *Mercantile* civilization. Schmitt’s notion of an “earth-bound” order vs. a liberal maritime order directly informs Dugin’s framing of Eurasia (heartland empires with traditional, collectivist values) versus Atlantis (sea powers with liberal, individualist values) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)) ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=century%20to%20draw%20what%20is,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)). Dugin assumes, following Schmitt, that this dualism is the “basic law of geopolitics” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%2010%2081%20Geopolitics%20as,82)). He also embraces Schmitt’s argument that land powers must assert a *Nomos* (law/order) of the earth, carving out large spheres where their values dominate, unimpeded by maritime internationalism. Essentially, Chapter 8 provides the ideological justification for Russia to create a closed Eurasian bloc with its own rules (a conservative, authoritarian order) in opposition to the “Atlantic” world’s liberal order ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). Dugin’s supporting evidence here is largely theoretical, referencing Schmitt and other “conservative-revolutionary” thinkers, rather than empirical – it’s an appeal to philosophy and the historical pattern of conflicts.  

**Chapter 9 – “Pyotr Savitsky: Eurasia as the ‘Middle Earth’”:** Dugin then discusses Pyotr Savitsky, a Russian émigré geographer of the 1920s and a founder of classical Eurasianism. Savitsky viewed Russia not as a part of Europe or Asia, but as a distinct *Eurasian* continent-civilization – a “Middle World” with its own unique culture and destiny ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%209%2071%20Pyotr%20Savitsky,72)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%208%2063%20Karl%20Schmitt,65)). Dugin enthusiastically reviews Savitsky’s ideas such as *Mestorazvitie* (place-development), which argued that the Eurasian landmass naturally integrates peoples and economies. He highlights Savitsky’s notion that Russia-Eurasia has a historical “fate” separate from the West ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%209%2071%20Pyotr%20Savitsky,72)). This chapter’s main claim is essentially the civilizational uniqueness of Russia: Dugin uses Savitsky’s work to assert that Russia is destined to lead a *Eurasian union* of peoples, uniting Slavs, Turkic peoples, etc., in a single geopolitical space. He notes the assumption shared by Eurasianists that Western European culture is alien to Russia, and that the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in some ways was an expression of Eurasia’s difference (even as Savitsky and others were anti-communist). By grounding his framework in Savitsky’s Eurasianist thought, Dugin provides historical legitimacy from Russian intellectual tradition. The supporting “evidence” here is historical-cultural analysis: e.g. citing how the Russian Empire/Soviet Union integrated dozens of nationalities across Eurasia, which Dugin interprets as proof of an enduring Eurasian civilizational model. Ultimately, Chapter 9 reinforces the argument that Russia must embrace a Eurasian identity (not a European one) and rebuild a continental empire to fulfill its destiny ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20Eurasian%20ideology%20draws%20an,moving%20force%20of%20a%20rather)).  

**Chapter 10 – “Geopolitics as an Instrument of National Policy”:** This concluding chapter of Part I synthesizes the lessons from the previous thinkers and makes an explicit argument: geopolitics should serve as a practical tool for Russian state strategy. Dugin asserts that geopolitics is *not* a neutral science but a committed, “engaged” discipline ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Geopolitics%20as%20an%20instrument%20of,84)). He outlines what he calls the *“planetary dualism”* as the basic law of geopolitics ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%2010%2081%20Geopolitics%20as,82)) – referring to the fundamental opposition of Land vs Sea, East vs West, Eurasia vs Atlantic. All his earlier surveys lead to this point: Dugin claims this dualism has governed world history (e.g. Athens vs. Sparta, Rome vs. Carthage, Britain vs. Napoleonic France, USA vs. USSR – he sees each as a version of the same clash). He argues a true geopolitician must take sides in this grand struggle; in his view, Russian geopoliticians must “be engaged” on behalf of Eurasia ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Geopolitics%20as%20an%20instrument%20of,84)). In this chapter Dugin also likely introduces the idea that after the Cold War, the battle *did not end* – “the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians has not ended” he declares ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20a%20moment%20of%20exultant,be%20exaggerated%2C%20it%20also%20should)). He thus sets the stage for the rest of the book: having established that geopolitics justifies Russian expansionism and alliance-building against the Atlanticists, he now will apply these ideas to the current world situation. Chapter 10 effectively transitions from historical/theoretical review to contemporary strategy, asserting that Russia’s foreign policy must openly adopt a geopolitical doctrine aimed at overturning Western hegemony. (Notably, Dugin credits or thanks certain Russian military thinkers here – the book’s preface and this chapter mention that a Russian General, Nikolai Klokotov, and Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov helped inspire or draft parts of the work ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20credits%20General%20Nikolai%20Klokotov,8)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Colonel%20General%20Leonid%20Ivashov%20%2C,8)), underscoring its intent as a guide for national policy.) In sum, the assumption driving Chapter 10 is that *geopolitics provides a “scientific” cover for neo-imperial policy* – and Dugin explicitly frames his subsequent proposals as following this geopolitical imperative.  

## Part II: Modern Geopolitical Schools & The “Atlanticist” World (Ch. 1–6)  
Having laid the theoretical groundwork, Dugin moves on to analyze the late-20th-century geopolitical situation. Part II of the book (approximately chapters 1–6 in this section) examines the dominant Western strategies and the ideological currents shaping the post-Cold War world, which Dugin collectively terms *“Atlantism”* or *Mondialism* (globalism).

**Chapter 1 – “Overview”:** Dugin begins Part II with an overview of the contemporary global context (circa mid-1990s). He notes that with the Soviet collapse, the West emerged dominant, promoting a *“unipolar”* world order. He frames this as a temporary and dangerous situation in which Atlanticist ideologies (liberal democracy, free markets, global institutions) are trumpeting victory – e.g. referencing Francis Fukuyama’s “End of History” thesis as emblematic of Western triumphalism ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Mondialism%20,115)). Dugin’s overview asserts that despite appearances, this unipolar moment is fragile and ripe for challenge. He assumes a conspiratorial tone, suggesting Western globalism (*Mondialism*) is actively working to undermine states like Russia from within (through NGOs, liberal reforms, etc.). This overview likely recaps the notion that geopolitical struggle is ongoing: even though Russia was weakened in the 1990s, the game is not over. Dugin sets up the need for a Russian response by highlighting how Atlanticist power is extending into Eastern Europe, the former USSR, and even Russian domestic politics. The “Overview” essentially states the problem: the Western-centric world order stands in the way of Russia’s geopolitical future, and thus must be analyzed and ultimately countered.  

**Chapter 2 – “Modern Atlanticism”:** In this chapter, Dugin delves into the geopolitical thought and strategy of the Atlanticist powers (the U.S., UK, and their allies) after WWII and particularly after 1991. He surveys figures he calls *Spykman’s followers* – strategists like Dean Acheson, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others who shaped U.S. Cold War policy ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Modern%20Atlanticism%20,102%20Chapter%203%20107)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,98)). Dugin outlines how Atlanticists cemented their victory in the Cold War: by expanding NATO, fostering the European Union under Western influence, and promoting a network of global institutions (IMF, World Bank, etc.) to entrench U.S. dominance. He notes that *“the Atlantists won the Cold War”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,98)) and identifies two strands of Atlanticism: one pragmatic-realist (Kissinger-style balance of power) and one liberal-idealist (spreading democracy and free markets) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=C,111)). He also introduces the idea of *“aerocracy”* or *“etherocracy”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=C,101)) – likely referring to the U.S.’s use of air power and now even space/electronic domains to maintain dominance, an extension of sea power into the air. A key claim in this chapter is that Atlanticists seek *to surround and contain Russia* – Dugin cites the expansion of NATO to Russia’s borders and the concept of a “sanitary cordon” of pro-West states from the Baltics down to Ukraine and the Caucasus ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Supporting evidence he provides includes contemporary events: NATO’s incorporation of Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary (which was underway in the late ’90s), partnerships with Baltic states, and U.S. military presence in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. Dugin’s assumption is that Atlanticism is inherently anti-Russian (a view reinforced by his reading of Brzezinski’s *Grand Chessboard* which explicitly regarded Eurasian unity under Russian leadership as a threat). He likely references Samuel Huntington’s “Clash of Civilizations” as a *neo-Atlantist* view that still positions Western civilization against others ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,111)). Overall, Chapter 2 paints the Atlanticists as pursuing global domination via NATO and economic globalization, setting up a villain in Dugin’s narrative that Russia must resist.  

**Chapter 3 – “Mondialism”:** *Mondialism* refers to the ideology of one-worldism or globalism. Here, Dugin critiques the philosophical and political movement toward a single world system (which he associates with Atlanticist liberal order). He traces a “prehistory” of Mondialism ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,115)) – citing perhaps the Enlightenment cosmopolitan ideals, Wilsonian internationalism, and post-WWII liberal institutionalism. Dugin argues that the post-Cold War era marks the *“planetary victory of the West”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Mondialism%20,112)), wherein Western liberal values are being universalized. He discusses thinkers like Fukuyama (who proclaimed the end of ideological conflict in favor of liberal democracy) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Mondialism%20,115)), and Jacques Attali’s idea of *“geo-economics”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=3,115)) where markets dictate geopolitical power. Dugin is highly skeptical of these – he sees them as a smokescreen for American hegemony (what he calls *“Anglo-Saxon mondialism”*). He also mentions more dystopian or contrarian globalist ideas – e.g., perhaps those of the Club of Rome, or “post-catastrophic mondialism” of certain futurists ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Mondialism%20,115)) – to show that even within the West some envision chaos or transformations that could upend the current order. The main claim is that *globalization under Western auspices erodes national sovereignty and distinct cultures*, something Dugin (a traditionalist) abhors. He supports this by pointing to the 1990s policies in Russia: adoption of Western-style capitalism and governance which, in his view, led to chaos and impoverishment. He likely labels Russia’s liberal reformers as agents (witting or unwitting) of mondialism, weakening the state. By dissecting mondialism, Dugin is warning that if Russia does nothing, it will be absorbed into a borderless, American-led world – a fate he finds unacceptable. This chapter’s analysis underpins his later call for a multipolar world as an antidote to mondialist unipolarity.  

**Chapter 4 – “Applied Geopolitics”:** Dugin uses this chapter to critique what he considers pseudo-geopolitics or misapplications of geopolitical theory. He reviews various attempts to use geopolitics in domestic and foreign policy analysis, distinguishing *true* geopolitics from what he sees as shallow analogies. For instance, he discusses *“domestic geopolitics”* approaches like those of French geographer Yves Lacoste ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20117%20Applied%20geopolitics,117%205)), who applied geographic analysis to internal political phenomena (e.g., voting patterns by region). Dugin likely dismisses some of these “electoral geopolitics” and “mediaocracy as a geopolitical factor” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20117%20Applied%20geopolitics,117%205)) as distractions from the real geopolitical struggle. He contends that true geopolitics must remain focused on large-scale power dynamics (Land vs Sea blocs) rather than micro-analyses of media or local politics. This chapter also covers the *history of geopolitics as a discipline* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20117%20Applied%20geopolitics,117%205)), which Dugin uses to argue that Western academics sanitized or sidelined classical geopolitics after WWII (due to its association with fascism), whereas Russia should revive it unabashedly. The claim is that many Western intellectuals engage in *“Applied geopolitics” in name only – technocratic policy studies that miss the civilizational big picture* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20117%20Applied%20geopolitics,117%205)). Dugin asserts that Russia must reclaim the *strategic, big-picture geopolitics*, not the watered-down version. He likely provides examples: e.g., U.S. political science focusing on democratization or economics (which Dugin views as neglecting the spatial power realities), or Russian liberals focusing on integration into the world economy (which he sees as capitulation). The subtext is that geopolitics must be applied *correctly* – i.e., to guide national grand strategy. Any application that doesn’t serve national (Eurasian) power ends up being a “geopolitics without geopolitics” (perhaps what he means by *“‘applied’ not geopolitics”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20117%20Applied%20geopolitics,117%205))). This somewhat polemical chapter reinforces Dugin’s stance that Russia’s leaders should adopt his style of geopolitics rather than Western social science in making policy.  

**Chapter 5 – “The Geopolitics of the European New Right”:** In this important chapter, Dugin examines ideas from Europe’s New Right thinkers, showing how European anti-liberal theorists parallel and bolster his Eurasian vision. He discusses concepts such as *“Europe of a Hundred Flags”* (attributed to French New Right philosopher Alain de Benoist) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5)) – the idea of a Europe of regions, rejecting both Americanization and the unitary EU superstate in favor of local identities federating in a civilization. Dugin notes de Benoist’s and others’ firm anti-American, anti-globalization stance, which aligns with his own anti-Atlanticism. He also covers Jean Thiriart’s dream of a *“Europe from Vladivostok to Dublin”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5)) – Thiriart (a Belgian far-right figure) advocated a united Europe including the Soviet Union, essentially a single Euro–Soviet empire to oppose the U.S. Dugin enthusiastically cites such proposals as evidence that *Western Europeans could be natural allies for Russia* if they reject Atlanticism. Additionally, he references thinkers like Jordi Savall or Carlo Terracciano (the chapter lists “Thinking in Continents” by J. von Lohausen, “The Eurasian Empire of the End” by Jean Parvulesco, “Russia + Islam = Salvation of Europe” by Terracciano) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5)). Each of these New Right ideas reinforces a component of Dugin’s plan: for example, Terracciano’s formula “Russia + Islam = Europe’s salvation” suggests that an alliance between Russian and Islamic traditionalists could help Europe break free of liberal decadence – precisely what Dugin proposes in his strategy ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)). Dugin uses these sources to lend credibility to his claim that *Europe has an internal impulse to revolt against American hegemony*. The supporting evidence is largely ideological writings and small movements in Europe (e.g., European far-right parties or intellectual circles in the 1990s that admired Serbia or showed sympathy to Russia). Dugin assumes that by partnering with these right-wing European elements, Russia can drive a wedge between Europe and America. In sum, Chapter 5’s argument is that there is an alternative European geopolitics – one where Europe chooses to align with Russia (the East) in a traditionalist bloc rather than with the Anglo-Saxon West. Dugin is effectively extending a hand to European “dissidents” against the U.S.-led order, backing it with these New Right theories.  

**Chapter 6 – “Neo-Eurasianism”:** This chapter is where Dugin brings the focus back to Russia and develops his own school of thought, *neo-Eurasianism*, building on the earlier Eurasianists (like Savitsky) but updated for the 21st century. He introduces key neo-Eurasianist ideas and figures: **(6.1)** He discusses *“Eurasian passionarity”* as developed by Lev Gumilev ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%206%20135%20Neo,138)). Gumilev was a Soviet-era historian who proposed the theory of **passionarnost’**, meaning a civilizational vital energy or drive that causes certain peoples to expand and dominate. Dugin appropriates Gumilev’s idea to argue that the Russian/Eurasian civilization has a high passionarity that will reassert itself – essentially that Russians have an almost mystical drive to empire and leadership. **(6.2)** “The New Russian Eurasians” – Dugin surveys modern writers and politicians in Russia who, like him, are reviving Eurasianist ideas ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%206%20135%20Neo,138)). This may include himself and his contemporaries (e.g., he might mention his involvement with the Eurasia Movement, or figures like Aleksandr Prokhanov, etc.). He likely highlights how neo-Eurasianism blends elements of nationalism, Orthodoxy, and even Bolshevik nostalgia into a new imperial idea, appealing to a broad range of Russian society disillusioned with the 1990s pro-West direction. **(6.3)** “Towards a new bipolarity” – Dugin concludes the chapter by stating that the goal of neo-Eurasianism is to create a new bipolar or multipolar world: in the immediate term, a *new bipolarity of Eurasia vs. the West* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=the%20very%20raison%20d%E2%80%99%C3%AAtre%20of,it%20should%20be%20stressed%20250)) to replace the unipolar moment. Eventually, he hints this could evolve into a true multipolar order after the Atlanticist bloc is broken. The main claims of Chapter 6 are that Russia has a renewed ideological basis (neo-Eurasianism) for asserting itself and that this movement is gaining momentum. The assumptions include a quasi-metaphysical belief in Russia’s destiny (via Gumilev’s passionarity or spiritual mission), and the notion that the chaos of the 1990s is giving rise to a more assertive Russia under new ideological banners. As supporting evidence, Dugin might point to rising patriotism in Russia, the formation of think tanks (he founded the Center for Geopolitical Expertise in 1999 ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Some%20time%20in%20late%201999%2C,which%20until%20recently%20had%20been))), the interest of military academies in his work, and President Putin’s own statements about Russia as a “Eurasian country” (Putin in 2000 remarked on Russia’s Eurasian identity, which Dugin celebrated ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20November%202000%2C%20shortly%20before,30)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20November%202000%2C%20shortly%20before,30))). Thus, Chapter 6 serves as a bridge from analysis to action – Dugin shows that the intellectual and political currents in Russia are aligning with his call for a Eurasian revival, preparing the ground for the strategic program he will lay out next.  

*(It should be noted that the book’s structure is complex, and after Chapter 6, Dugin transitions into outlining concrete strategies for Russia. The remaining parts of the book systematically describe how Russia should build its Eurasian empire and confront various regions. Below, we break down those strategic prescriptions.)*  

## Part III: Russia and “Space” – Reclaiming the Heartland (Ch. 1–4)  
Part III of *Foundations of Geopolitics* moves from theory to practice, focusing on Russia’s spatial strategy: how to consolidate the Heartland and begin *“Gathering the Empire.”* Dugin believes Russia must first secure its own regional sphere (the former Soviet Union and nearby territories) as the core of the Eurasian bloc. This part thus covers strategic directions (north, south, east) and immediate goals.

**Chapter 1 – “Heartland”:** Dugin reiterates Russia’s identity as the Heartland power and stresses the urgent need to reassert control over the core of Eurasia – essentially the lands of the former USSR. He likely defines the Heartland in contemporary terms: Russia plus the other CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries in Central Asia and maybe Ukraine/Belarus. The main argument is that *Russia cannot be secure or great without dominating its Heartland region*. He points to the power vacuum left by Soviet collapse and argues Western influence is encroaching (through NATO expansions in Eastern Europe and revolutions in former Soviet states). Dugin probably uses maps or descriptions showing Russia surrounded by a belt of newly independent states – what he later calls the “near abroad” – that disrupt the contiguous Eurasian space. His prescription is clear: **integrate these states back under Moscow’s leadership**, whether via alliances, economic union, or direct political influence. As evidence, he cites historical patterns (Russia traditionally expanded to secure borders on all sides) and strategic logic (e.g., without Ukraine, Russia loses access to the Black Sea and its position as a empire is weakened – echoing Mackinder’s warning that if Russia lacks Ukraine it’s less formidable). Indeed, Dugin bluntly states **“Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning… no cultural import… no geographic uniqueness”** and should be *divided and absorbed by Russia (Eastern Ukraine) with the Western part possibly under some European influence* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)). This shocking claim encapsulates his Heartland-centric view: Ukraine is seen only as a piece of the Heartland puzzle, and Dugin assumes it must belong to Russia for the Eurasian project to succeed. In support, he invokes history (Kyiv as the cradle of Rus’ civilization) and the large ethnic Russian population in Ukraine to justify annexation or at least a vassal status. Chapter 1 essentially lays down the marker: Reunifying the core Eurasian land (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, etc.) is the first step in Dugin’s geopolitical offensive.  

**Chapter 2 – “The Rimland Problem”:** Here Dugin tackles the challenge posed by the surrounding Rimland nations on Russia’s periphery that align with the West. This includes the Baltic states, Eastern Europe (Poland, etc.), the Caucasus, and potentially Turkey and Iran to the south. He identifies these as part of the American strategy to encircle Russia ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). The main claim is that Russia must “break the encirclement” by neutralizing or flipping these Rimland areas. For Europe’s borderlands, Dugin suggests different treatments: For instance, the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) are tiny and strongly Western-oriented; he proposes they be given *“special status”* or partial integration – at minimum kept out of NATO ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=unacceptable.%5B%209%20%5D%20,in%20the%20Eurasian%20sphere)). He even writes that Estonia could fall under Germany’s influence, while Latvia and Lithuania might be eventually integrated into Russia’s sphere (despite those nations’ desires for independence) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). For Belarus and Moldova, Dugin is unequivocal: they *“are to become part of Russia”* outright ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L550%20unacceptable.,in%20the%20Eurasian%20sphere)) (indeed Belarus already leaned that way). Poland, he suggests, can have a “special status” – perhaps autonomy within a Eurasian sphere or a role as a buffer, but not true independence in the Western sense ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=unacceptable.%5B%209%20%5D%20,in%20the%20Eurasian%20sphere)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=independent.%5B%209%20%5D%20,in%20the%20Eurasian%20sphere)). In the Balkans, Dugin emphasizes supporting Serbia and other Orthodox Slavs: he imagines a bloc of Serbia, Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece allied with Moscow (the “Orthodox East”), rejecting the “rational-individualistic West” ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=influence.%5B%209%20%5D%20,individualistic)). Essentially, Chapter 2 lays out a partitioning of Europe: Western Europe (Germany/France) might partner with Russia, while Eastern Europe is either absorbed or neutralized. The *“sanitary cordon”* of pro-Western states must be dismantled ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20347%20Threat%20of,351)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,351)). For the Caucasus and Turkey – also part of the encirclement – Dugin again sees a Rimland to break. He regards the Caucasus as inherently Russian territory (a viewpoint that justifies Moscow’s military presence there). Georgia, in his view, has no independent role – he implies Georgia should be split or absorbed to give Russia full control to the south. On Turkey, he is extremely hostile (Turkey is a NATO member controlling Russia’s access to the Mediterranean via the Black Sea). Dugin argues Russia should **foment separatism inside Turkey** – *“create geopolitical shocks within Turkey”* by supporting Kurdish and Armenian movements to destabilize it ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). He even envisions Turkey’s possible dismemberment by a joint action of Russia, Armenia, and Iran ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=According%20to%20Dugin%2C%20a%20key,Russia%2C%20Iran%2C%20and%20Armenia)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Turkish%20minorities%20are%20to%20be,%28244)). His assumption is that a strong Turkey allied with the West is a dagger at Eurasia’s heart, so it must be broken or at least pushed out of alignment. In sum, Chapter 2 outlines the “frontline” of conflict: from the Baltic to the Black Sea, Russia should be actively undermining NATO’s position. Dugin provides the rationale (preventing Western bases and influence on Russia’s borders) and cites examples like Western support for Chechen rebels or for color revolutions as acts of hybrid war that Russia must answer in kind, by undermining Western footholds (e.g., encouraging Scotland or Quebec separatism as a tit-for-tat – an idea he expands on in later chapters regarding the US and UK ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,is%20not%20all%20that%20fantastical)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make))).  

**Chapter 3 – “Gathering the Empire”:** This chapter likely describes the political and diplomatic process of forming the new Eurasian Empire. Dugin uses the term *“Gathering of the Lands”* (evoking the 15th-century Muscovy princes who united Russian lands after Mongol rule) to frame Russia’s task of reassembling the Soviet/post-Soviet space. The main claims here are about alliance-building and federation structures. Dugin proposes a new *Eurasian Union* (distinct from mere CIS cooperation) with Russia at the center. This may involve a formal empire or a tightly bound alliance system. He suggests creating a *“Moscow-Berlin axis”* in the west and a *“Moscow-Tokyo axis”* in the east as pillars of the Eurasian bloc ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Germany,extraterritorial%20floating)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). Practically, “gathering the empire” means Russia forging bilateral and multilateral deals: e.g., drawing Germany into a partnership (perhaps exchanging Russian political support for German dominance in Western Europe), persuading Japan to ally with Russia (possibly by offering economic concessions or parts of Siberia or the Kuril Islands, as he indeed suggests giving Japan the Kuril Islands back to win its friendship ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Tibet%20%E2%80%93%20381%E2%80%93Inner%20Mongolia%20%E2%80%93,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Indochina%20%20,9))). Dugin outlines that *Europe (especially France and Germany) should be “Finlandized” – i.e., neutralized and drawn away from U.S. influence* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L527%20other%20countries.,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Germany,extraterritorial%20floating)). He explicitly says the “**maximum task is the 'Finlandization' of all of Europe**” ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)) – meaning Europe would remain formally independent but essentially defer to Russia’s lead, as Finland did in the Cold War. Supporting evidence he gives might include the undercurrent of Gaullist thought in France (de Gaulle’s notion of a Europe “from the Atlantic to the Urals”) and German resentments over Anglo-American dominance. Dugin also points to practical leverage: Russia’s oil and gas could be used to bind Germany and Europe to it, weakening Atlantic ties. In the East, “gathering the empire” involves integrating Central Asia completely. Dugin stresses that Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan – all the Central Asian republics – *must fall in line with Moscow* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=%5D%20,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). He sees these largely as historically part of Russia’s realm (except now China is competing for influence there, which he addresses soon). Another aspect is forging the *“Russian-Islamic alliance”* on the southern rim ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can)). Dugin astonishingly argues that Russia and certain Islamic countries share an interest in overturning Western dominance. Key among these is **Iran**: he calls Iran a “key ally” and speaks of a *“Moscow–Tehran axis”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). In this chapter, he likely describes preliminary steps already taken or possible: Russian support for Iran’s nuclear program or arms, in exchange for Iran’s cooperation against American influence in the Middle East and Central Asia. “Gathering the Empire” thus is about aligning all these pieces: reabsorb former USSR lands, lock in alliances with major Eurasian powers (Germany, Iran, possibly Japan/India), and set the stage to confront the common enemy. Dugin assumes that these diverse actors can be united by their *“rejection of Atlanticism”*, which he says will be the **“fundamental principle”** of the Eurasian Empire – unity through a common enemy ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=American%20revolution,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)). He cites historical examples of alliances of convenience (e.g., the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, or the way disparate Allies united in WWII against Hitler) to argue this is feasible. In sum, Chapter 3 sketches out a grand coalition-building effort led by Russia, effectively forming the *World-Island coalition* that Mackinder once warned about, but now in Dugin’s eyes, to be directed against the thalassocratic (sea power) West.  

**Chapter 4 – “Warm and Cold Seas”:** Dugin here addresses Russia’s quest for access to oceans – a traditional geopolitical problem (Russian empires long sought warm-water ports). The chapter’s title suggests a discussion of maritime strategy: “warm seas” likely refers to the Black Sea and Mediterranean (and perhaps the Indian Ocean), whereas “cold seas” refers to the Arctic and maybe North Pacific. Dugin’s main argument is that *Russia must secure outlets to the high seas to be a true global power*, ending its historical landlocked handicap in certain regions. He advocates firmly controlling the Black Sea and Baltic Sea (hence the importance of Crimea, which in 1997 was part of Ukraine – Dugin insists it should belong to Russia, a goal later realized in 2014). He also emphasizes the need for a strong Russian presence in the Mediterranean: likely via alliances with Greece and a foothold in Syria or other Middle Eastern ports (indeed, Syria’s port Tartus was a minor Russian naval facility in the 90s, and Dugin would have seen potential there). For the Indian Ocean “warm seas,” he envisions access via Iran: if a Moscow-Tehran axis is formed, Iran’s coastline could become available for Russian use, creating a *“Russian-Iranian strategic continuum”* from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can)). In the Far East, Dugin weighs Russia’s Pacific access: Vladivostok gives a cold Pacific port; he also floats the idea of offering Japan the Kuril Islands in exchange for a break with the US, which could give Russia a partial say in the Western Pacific as an ally of Japan ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Tibet%20%E2%80%93%20381%E2%80%93Inner%20Mongolia%20%E2%80%93,9)). For the north, Dugin discusses the Arctic Ocean – “the road to the North” (which is elaborated more in a later part on internal geopolitics) – noting the Arctic’s importance for strategic submarines and resource claims ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L220%20Chapter%202,292)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%202%20291%20The%20road,292)). He likely urges militarization and development of Russia’s Arctic coast (a vision we see Russia follow in the 2000s by building bases in the far north). The chapter underscores that control of key “chokepoints” and maritime routes is as important for Eurasia as it has been for the Atlantic powers. Dugin wants Russia to overcome its traditional naval inferiority: one assumption is that alliances can substitute for a lack of native warm-water ports (e.g., use Iranian or Indian ports through partnership). Indeed, he identifies **India** as an essential partner for naval and economic reasons – India, an Indian Ocean power historically friendly to Russia, can be the southern anchor of Eurasia against the West ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=stratagem%20is%20as%20a%20strategic,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). He sees India as a “strategic outpost of Eurasia” against the West, and notes recent Russia-India cooperation as a positive sign (today we know India did sign a free trade framework with the Eurasian Economic Union, echoing Dugin’s foresight ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=stratagem%20is%20as%20a%20strategic,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally))). In contrast, China’s access to warm seas (South China Sea, etc.) he views with suspicion – thus, controlling “warm seas” also means preventing China from monopolizing them. Essentially, Chapter 4 articulates the maritime dimension of Dugin’s plan: ensuring the Eurasian alliance is not stuck in the middle of the continent but can project power outwards. The evidence Dugin might use includes Russia’s historical frustrations (Crimean War loss, etc.) and contemporary events like NATO using the Mediterranean to intervene in the Balkans (1990s Yugoslav wars) which Russia could not stop due to lack of naval presence. All this reinforces the urgency for Russia to become a true “two-ocean” power (Atlantic via the Med, and Pacific) in partnership with others.  

*(Parts IV and V of the book continue Dugin’s strategic blueprint. Part IV deals with the broader global confrontation – how the Eurasian Empire should combat the U.S. and shape the world – and Part V addresses Russia’s internal geopolitics. We summarize these below.)*  

## Part IV: The Grand Anti-Atlantic Strategy (Ch. 1–9)  
In Part IV, Dugin outlines how, once Russia/Eurasia consolidates regionally, it can take on the global hegemon (the United States) and establish a new world order. This part is the heart of *Foundations of Geopolitics*, prescribing actions across various theaters: Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and within the U.S. itself. It culminates in Dugin’s vision of a multipolar world centered on a **Eurasian Empire built on the “common enemy” principle** (all unite against Atlanticism) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)).

**Europe – “Moscow–Berlin Axis” and the Fate of the EU:** Dugin’s strategy for Europe is to sever it from American influence. He advocates a *“Moscow–Berlin axis”* as the backbone of Europe ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Germany,extraterritorial%20floating)). Germany, as Europe’s strongest state and with a history of at times opposing Anglo-American dominance, is Russia’s target partner. Dugin suggests encouraging Franco-German cooperation as well, noting both countries have “firm anti-Atlanticist traditions” (e.g. De Gaulle’s policies in France, Ostpolitik in Germany) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Germany,extraterritorial%20floating)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=have%20a%20%22firm%20anti,extraterritorial%20floating)). His plan calls for **France and Germany to form a geopolitical bloc with Russia**, effectively controlling Europe from the Atlantic coast to the Russian border. The UK, by contrast, is written off as hopelessly Atlanticist – Dugin describes Britain as an “extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.” that should be cut off from Europe ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20base%20of,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=base%20of%20the%20U.S.,9)). In practice, he wants to *“push Great Britain out of the EU”* or at least minimize British influence on the continent ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=threats%20to%20its%20objectives%20in,narratives%20aimed%20at%20the%20Western)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)). (It’s worth noting how eerily this aligns with events like **Brexit in 2016**, which indeed saw Britain leave the EU – a development commentators have noted was cheered by Dugin’s followers as a step toward weakening Atlantic unity ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)).) Dugin even proposes fueling separatism within the UK: *“promoting separatist tendencies in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales”* to break Britain internally ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,is%20not%20all%20that%20fantastical)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Great%20Britain%20by%20promoting%20%E2%80%9Cseparatist,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)). For the rest of Western Europe, Dugin envisions what one might call **“Greater Europe” under Eurasia** – an EU that is friendly to Moscow or perhaps a new “Paris-Berlin-Moscow” alliance structure. He sees signs of this in the 1990s through the skepticism some European elites had toward American unilateralism. His assumption is that *Europe can be convinced that its true interests lie in partnership with resource-rich, security-providing Russia rather than distant America*. To support this, he cites Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, cultural affinities (Christendom vs. American multiculturalism), and possible weariness of American dictat. He also references far-right and far-left movements in Europe that are anti-NATO – proof, in his eyes, of fertile ground for an anti-Atlanticist turn. Dugin’s strategy for Europe is thus **divide and conquer**: detach the continental core (Franco-German Europe) from the Anglo-Saxon world, and simultaneously fragment any strongly pro-Atlantic parts (UK, and Eastern Europe if needed). The desired outcome is a Europe that is either neutral or allied with Eurasia, effectively removing NATO’s raison d’être. Indeed, he imagines a scenario where NATO and the EU dissolve or are hollowed out: we have seen some attempt in real life – Russian outreach to European populist parties, disinformation to sow distrust in NATO, and efforts like cultivating ties with politicians (e.g. former German Chancellor Schröder’s friendship with Putin). While in the 1990s this was speculative, Dugin laid out those intentions explicitly. By weakening transatlantic bonds, Russia would face a much-reduced Western threat in any future confrontation with the U.S.  

**The “Continental Russian–Islamic Alliance” (Middle East and Central Asia):** Dugin places heavy emphasis on partnering with Middle Eastern powers to encircle the southern flank of the West. He proclaims *“the idea of a continental Russian–Islamic alliance lies at the heart of the anti-Atlanticist strategy”* ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=possible%20strategic%20partners%20against%20Atlanticists,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)). This is striking, given Russia’s own conflicts with Islamic militants; Dugin’s approach is opportunistic: ally with Islamic civilization where it suits the goal of undermining the West. **Iran** is singled out as the pivotal ally. He calls for a *“Moscow–Tehran axis”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can)), praising Iran’s defiance of the U.S. and noting cultural commonalities with Russia’s anti-West traditionalism. The alliance with Iran would secure Russia’s influence in the Persian Gulf and Middle East. Practically, since the ’90s Russia indeed moved to cooperate with Iran (e.g. on nuclear technology and arms), which aligns with Dugin’s advice. **Armenia** is another key piece: Dugin says Armenia (Christian but hostile to Turkey and Azerbaijan) should be a “strategic base” for Russia in the Caucasus, forming a subsidiary axis *Moscow–Yerevan–Tehran* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,within%20Turkey.%20These%20can)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). He even frames it in quasi-racial terms, calling Armenians an “Aryan people like the Iranians and Kurds” to emphasize a supposed civilizational link to indo-european roots, as opposed to the Turks ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). The plan implies heavy Russian support to Armenia (which we have seen in reality through military bases and backing in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict) to secure a loyal outpost bordering Turkey and Iran. **Azerbaijan**, on the other hand, is seen as an obstacle due to its pro-Turkish stance and oil resources that attract Western companies. Dugin bluntly suggests Azerbaijan could be *“split up or given to Iran”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Armenians%20,within%20Turkey.%20These%20can)) – essentially sacrificing Azerbaijan’s sovereignty to cement the Russo-Iranian partnership (the northern part possibly absorbed by Russia or made a puppet, and southern part by Iran, reflecting some historical Persian claims). This is a ruthless example of Dugin’s realpolitik: carving states to bolster an alliance. **Turkey** is treated as the prime enemy in this region (aside from the U.S. itself). Dugin argues for a long-term strategy to weaken Turkey severely. He advocates using every ethnic and sectarian fissure: supporting Kurdish rebels (PKK and others) to carve out an independent Kurdistan, encouraging Armenians (likely in Eastern Turkey or in pressing the genocide recognition issue), and even Greek interests (in Western Thrace or Cyprus) to *“attack the Turkish regime”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). The goal is to either force Turkey to retreat from an Atlantic alignment or to break it apart. If outright dismemberment of Turkey by Russia and its regional allies isn’t possible, Dugin’s fallback is to **redirect Turkey southward**: essentially, *“encourage Turkey to expand into the Arab world (Syria, Iraq, Saudi) instead of north into Eurasia”* ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=According%20to%20Dugin%2C%20a%20key,Russia%2C%20Iran%2C%20and%20Armenia)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=predicts%20that%20Turkey%20could%20be,%28244)). That way, Turkey expends its energy away from Russia – possibly clashing with Arab states (and by extension the U.S.) and weakening itself. Dugin’s assumptions here are quite cynical: he views alliances with radical Islamists or the sponsoring of terrorism (e.g. via Kurdish insurgencies) as legitimate geopolitical tools to hurt Atlantic interests. He cites the historical rivalry between Ottoman Turkey and Russia, and Turkey’s NATO membership, as justification that Turkey must be dealt with as “harshly as the United States and China” ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=According%20to%20Dugin%2C%20a%20key,Russia%2C%20Iran%2C%20and%20Armenia)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=,into%20the%20Arab%20world)). Indeed, his language calls for affixing Turkey as a “scapegoat” in the Eurasian project ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=According%20to%20Dugin%2C%20a%20key,Russia%2C%20Iran%2C%20and%20Armenia)), implying Turkey will be blamed and targeted for conflicts to rally support among Russian and Islamic partners. **The Arab world:** Dugin sees less of a direct role, except that he wants to exclude American influence. He likely endorses Russian support for Iraq (which in the late 90s was under sanctions and anti-US), Syria (historically an ally of Moscow), and even Libya (then under Qaddafi). Notably, he mentions *Libya* as a possible partner and Iran’s ally ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)). He wrote this before Qaddafi’s fall; at the time, Libya was anti-NATO and could have served as a Mediterranean link in the “continental alliance.” The overarching strategy in the Middle East is: **form a Russia-Iran coalition, use it and proxies to destabilize pro-US regimes (Turkey, perhaps Gulf states like Saudi Arabia), and position Russia as the patron of a new “Islamic bloc” independent of the West.** The evidence Dugin gives is historical civilizational ties (he argues Orthodox Russia and the Islamic world share traditional, collectivist values against Western individualism ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can))) and realpolitik (both hate American dominance). While the practicality is dubious (Russia fighting Islamic militants in Chechnya while courting Islamic states abroad), Dugin’s arguments influenced a tendency in Russian foreign policy to seek partnerships with countries like Iran and Syria. We saw this bearing fruit in the 2010s, when Russia and Iran closely coordinated in Syria’s war. It’s essentially Dugin’s blueprint in action: build an anti-West coalition even if it means strange bedfellows.  

**East and South Asia – Countering China and Courting Japan/India:** Dugin’s view of Asia is complex. He recognizes China as a formidable civilization and at the time of writing, a growing power that could threaten Russia’s influence in Eurasia. He bluntly states that **China “must…be dismantled to the maximum degree possible”** because it is an “extreme geopolitical danger” and ideological rival to a Russian-led Eurasia ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=In%20East%20%20and%20,379)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,offering%20the%20%20390%20Kuril)). This is one of Dugin’s most controversial prescriptions: he essentially calls for breaking China into pieces. Specifically, he suggests that Russia should peel off China’s border regions into a buffer: *“take Tibet–Xinjiang–Inner Mongolia–Manchuria as a security belt”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=In%20East%20%20and%20,379)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,offering%20the%20%20390%20Kuril)). These regions (western and northern China) are populated by non-Han ethnic groups or historically had ties to Russia; Dugin imagines supporting Tibet’s independence (weakening China’s hold), stirring the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang (though interestingly that might conflict with courting Islamic allies, he probably counts on Pakistan’s alignment to manage that), and even taking back Inner Mongolia or making it independent (to ally with Mongolia proper, which he wants in Russia’s sphere ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Indochina%20%20,9))). Manchuria (northeast China) is resource-rich and was contested by Russia and Japan in the past – Dugin might envision Russian influence or even incorporation there under the guise of protecting it from Beijing. The goal is to shrink China’s reach and power. As compensation to China (or perhaps as a distraction), Dugin proposes *offering China help “in a southern direction” – encouraging Chinese expansion into Southeast Asia* (except Vietnam, which is a Russian traditional partner) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=independent%20Russian%20Federation%2C%20,be%20a%20friend%20of)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Tibet%20%E2%80%93%20381%E2%80%93Inner%20Mongolia%20%E2%80%93,offering%20the%20%20390%20Kuril)). This means tacitly allowing or even abetting Chinese influence over countries like Laos, Myanmar, maybe Malaysia or Indonesia – areas that are less critical to Russia. The idea is to turn China’s ambitions away from Siberia and Central Asia and towards the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Essentially, *steer China into conflict with U.S. and Western interests in the Pacific rather than with Russia in Eurasia*. This is a divide strategy reminiscent of Kissinger’s approach in reverse (the U.S. once played China against the USSR; Dugin wants Russia to play China against the U.S., but at arm’s length). For **Japan**, Dugin departs from traditional Russian antagonism. Noting Japan’s rivalry with the U.S. in trade and its need for resources, he argues Russia should attempt a strategic partnership with Japan **instead of China** ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=its%20varied%20resources%20compared%20to,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). He even advises manipulating Japanese politics by *offering the Kuril Islands* (disputed territory from WWII) back to Japan as a goodwill gesture to provoke *“anti-Americanism”* in Japan and draw Tokyo closer to Moscow ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Indochina%20%20,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)). The logic: if Japan feels secure with Russia (territorial issues resolved) and sees benefits (Siberian resources, less dependence on U.S.), it might distance itself from Washington. In reality this was a long shot – Japan in the 90s was firmly allied with the US – but Dugin saw an opening in any signs of “growing dissent between the Japanese and Americans” ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=its%20varied%20resources%20compared%20to,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). Indeed, he highlights that by the 2010s Russia did try to woo Japan (Putin met Abe many times, though ultimately Japan stayed with the West) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%C2%A0%20Dugin,is%20also%20up%20for%20debate)). **India** is unequivocally embraced by Dugin. India had Cold War ties to Moscow and is a rival to China and Pakistan. Dugin sees India as a vital ally: a huge country that can anchor South Asia in the Eurasian coalition and provide a counterweight to China if needed ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=stratagem%20is%20as%20a%20strategic,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). He considers India “the only role” to be a *“strategic outpost of Eurasia… and key economic partner”* in the Moscow-Tokyo axis concept ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,and%20growing%20dissent%20between%20the)). That axis essentially means Russia-Japan-India cooperating (perhaps along with Iran) to check China and present a united front to the Anglo-American naval power in the Indian Ocean/Pacific. Dugin likely references historical goodwill (Indo-Russian friendship, arms trade, etc.) and urges strengthening it (which has indeed happened: e.g. the BrahMos missile project, India joining the SCO and BRICS, etc.). **Southeast Asia:** Aside from suggesting China focus there, Dugin doesn’t emphasize it much except to carve out Vietnam as an exception (Russia had a naval refueling base at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam and traditionally good relations). Possibly he envisions Vietnam, and maybe Indonesia (a large, sometimes anti-Western country) as secondary partners in the long run. The upshot of Dugin’s East/South Asia plan is the containment or fragmentation of China and the inclusion of Asia’s other powers into the Eurasian fold. He assumes that China, as a rising superpower, is a threat to *Russian* hegemony in Asia just as much as the U.S. is – thus he advocates a proactive approach to keep China in check. This is one area where reality diverged: post-2000, Russia ended up aligning more with China (largely out of necessity against Western pressure), demonstrating a weakness in Dugin’s plan (he underestimated how Western hostility might force Russia and China together despite mutual distrust). Nonetheless, Dugin’s book explicitly warns of China and even suggests possible Russian-Chinese conflict if China resists being an adjunct to Eurasia ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=not%20to%20England%2C%20but%20to,active%20opposition%20to%20Eurasian%20projects)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=China%20will%20have%20to%20be,opponent%20with%20all%20the%20ensuing)). 

**The United States (and the Americas) – Undermining the “Insular Crescent”:** Finally, Dugin turns to the primary adversary, the U.S. Since a direct military confrontation would be too risky (nuclear weapons, distance), he advocates **asymmetrical warfare to “destabilize” and fragment the U.S. internally**. In an astonishing passage, *Foundations of Geopolitics* proposes that Russia should use its intelligence services to fuel societal division within America ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Americas%20%2C%20,301%2C%20and%20Canada)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make)). Dugin calls to *“introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=political%20state%20of%20affairs%20in,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)). The aim is to weaken the U.S. from within, distracting it and limiting its ability to project power abroad. For example, he mentions provoking “Afro-American racists” (likely referring to black nationalist groups or stoking racial tensions) and supporting isolationist tendencies in American politics ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=internal%20American%20activity%2C%20encouraging%20all,9)). Essentially, Dugin is endorsing a campaign of subversion: using propaganda, psychological operations, and any fissure in American society to create chaos. He even singles out **“isolationism”** – implying that Russia should encourage voices in the US that argue against international engagement, thus reducing American meddling overseas ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=internal%20American%20activity%2C%20encouraging%20all,9)). Notably, many analysts have observed that in the 2010s, Russian online influence operations did exactly this – spreading extremist content, fake news, and supporting both far-left and far-right causes in the West to polarize societies ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make)). Dugin’s blueprint predates social media, but the concept is the same. He also extends this strategy to Canada (which he lumps with the U.S. as an Anglophone bastion) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Americas%20%2C%20,301%2C%20and%20Canada)), and suggests *expanding the Eurasian sphere into Central and South America* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=sense%20simultaneously%20to%20support%20isolationist,9)) – for instance, courting anti-US regimes like Venezuela or fostering Latin American integration that excludes the U.S. This Latin strategy echoes historical Soviet outreach (Cuba, etc.), updated to the post-Cold War era (indeed Russia later built ties with Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and others, aligning with Dugin’s ideas). The overarching claim is that the U.S. is the ultimate obstacle to a multipolar world, so it must be crippled from within, as direct conquest is impossible. Supporting evidence Dugin might gesture to is America’s own internal strains (racial riots in its history, regional secessionist fringe movements like in Quebec or Texas, etc.) and the success of Soviet active measures in sowing discord during the Cold War. He essentially advises ramping those up. Dugin’s assumptions here are quite bold: he assumes the U.S. societal fabric is weak enough to rend and that doing so would not backfire on Russia. He also counts on America’s geographic insulation to be a weakness – that it can only be reached through subterfuge, not tanks. By including this in *Foundations*, Dugin makes clear that *no frontier of conflict is off-limits*: land, sea, and also the psychological/information domain. This holistic, unrestrained approach (which some have likened to a precursor of Russia’s “hybrid warfare” doctrine) is a notable feature of Dugin’s strategic thought. The desired outcome in Dugin’s mind would be a U.S. distracted by internal crises (say, racial unrest or political paralysis), unwilling or unable to stop Russia’s consolidation of Eurasia or to intervene decisively overseas (similar to how domestic turmoil in the 1970s post-Vietnam curbed U.S. foreign interventions for a time). In the very long term, he even muses about a potential fragmenting of the U.S. – though not explicitly stated in the summary, some Duginists imagine scenarios like an independent Texas or California. At minimum, he wants America to turn inward and forsake its role as “world police.” 

**Conclusion of Part IV:** By the end of this section (Chapter 9 is the conclusion), Dugin summarizes that the *Eurasian Empire will be built on the fundamental principle of “the common enemy” – uniting diverse allies by their shared anti-American, anti-Atlantic stance* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)). He declares that *“the battle for the world rule of Russians has not ended”*, framing Russia’s mission in almost messianic, revolutionary terms ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20a%20moment%20of%20exultant,be%20exaggerated%2C%20it%20also%20should)). The conclusion likely reiterates that if Russia can implement these strategies – carve Europe away from the US, ally with Iran and other anti-West forces, contain or break China, and undermine the U.S. directly – then a new world order will emerge. In that envisioned order, Eurasia (under Russian leadership) stands as the dominant super-bloc, and the era of Western (Atlanticist) global domination is finished. Dugin foresees that eventually, once Atlantic power is checked, the world could settle into a **multipolar balance** of major regions or a bipolar one between Eurasia and a diminished Atlantic alliance ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=the%20very%20raison%20d%E2%80%99%C3%AAtre%20of,it%20should%20be%20stressed%20250)). He also touches on economic aspects in Chapter 8 of this part (titled “Economic aspects of the New Empire”) – advocating a *“third way”* economics for Eurasia (neither free-market capitalism nor Marxist socialism, but a regionally autarkic, state-driven model) and economic *regionalism* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Economic%20aspects%20of%20the%20New,271)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=8,271)). This entails each geopolitical bloc being economically self-sufficient. For Eurasia, that means leveraging Russia’s energy and resources, Germany’s technology, Japan’s technology and capital, etc., to create an economy that can withstand globalist markets. Dugin briefly outlines that the Eurasian Empire should pursue **“autarky” and a mixed economy** (state-controlled strategic sectors with private enterprise under guidance – akin to fascist corporatism or the “third way” practiced by regimes like pre-war Germany or perhaps modern China) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Economic%20aspects%20of%20the%20New,271)). He warns against purely adopting Western liberal economics, as it would undermine sovereignty. This economic vision is less detailed than the geopolitical, but it underscores that controlling *“Big Spaces”* economically is part of the grand strategy. Finally, in concluding, Dugin likely issues a rallying call: that Russia’s elites must embrace this geopolitical doctrine wholeheartedly if Russia is to survive and lead. He contrasts it as a “revolutionary mission” against the status quo of American-led liberal order ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). The *Foreign Policy* magazine later described *Foundations of Geopolitics* as *“one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia in the post-Soviet era” – more sober and rigorously argued than Dugin’s earlier mystical works* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,modern%20occult%20movements%2C%20and%20the)). Indeed, the sober, strategic tone of Part IV’s conclusion – essentially a blueprint for global confrontation – is what makes the book so striking and, to many, frightening.  

## Part V: Russia’s Internal Geopolitics (Ch. 1–5)  
In the final part of the book, Dugin turns inward, analyzing how Russia’s domestic configuration must be reshaped to support the grand geopolitical strategy. He examines Russia’s regional structure, demographic and ethnic challenges, ideological cohesion, and potential internal vulnerabilities. Essentially, Part V asks: how can Russia fortify itself from within to become the core of the Eurasian empire?

**Chapter 1 – “Subject and Method”:** Dugin here defines what internal geopolitics means. He treats Russia itself as a vast landmass with its own “north, south, east, west” and heartland-periphery dynamics. The “subject” refers to the Russian state (which he wants to elevate from a mere nation-state to an imperial **subject** capable of big actions), and “method” likely refers to applying geopolitical analysis to domestic affairs. Dugin argues that Russia’s geography – spanning Europe to the Pacific, Arctic to Central Asia – gives it a unique internal diversity that must be managed geopolitically. He rejects the idea of Russia as just another nation with provinces; instead, he sees it as a mini-cosmos of civilizations. The main claim is that *Russia must consolidate internally, balancing its regions and ethnic groups under a unifying imperial idea*. He sets an assumption that federalism or liberal regional autonomy could weaken Russia (as it did in the 90s, with regions like Chechnya nearly seceding). Instead, a *“Eurasian ideology”* or patriotism should be inculcated to bind the disparate parts. He introduces the concept of **“Big Space”** (borrowed from Schmitt and the Eurasianists) applied to Russia – meaning Russia’s territory should be seen as one grand strategic space where central authority ensures unity ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L288%20Chapter%203,398)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=THE%20GEOPOLITICAL%20PROBLEMS%20OF%20THE,398)). Dugin likely critiques the 1990s trend of decentralization (when Yeltsin told regions “take as much sovereignty as you can swallow”). His evidence includes the chaos of that era: governors acting independently, Tatarstan and Chechnya asserting extra autonomy, etc., which he portrays as nearly fatal. The method he advocates is to re-impose vertical control – which indeed Putin did after 2000 by re-centralizing power. Dugin basically foreshadows that, insisting internal geopolitics demands a strong state that can direct resources and policy cohesively for the larger project.  

**Chapter 2 – “The Road to the North”:** This chapter focuses on Russia’s north – particularly the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions (like Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Komi, as well as the northern sea route). Dugin extols the strategic value of the Arctic, calling it Russia’s “Northern Heartland.” He discusses the *“geopolitical nature of the Russian Arctic”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%202%20291%20The%20road,292)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,292)) – vast resources (oil, gas, minerals), and the northern coastline which, if properly developed, could be a secure base and transport route (global warming and technology might open the Arctic sea lanes). The main argument is that *Russia must secure and develop its Far North as a stronghold*, both for economic and military reasons. Dugin suggests projects like expanding the Northern Fleet (to secure Arctic waters), exploiting Arctic energy deposits to fuel the economy, and ensuring that northern ethnic groups (Nenets, etc.) are integrated and loyal. He may mention the concept of a “Northern axis” – connecting Murmansk to Moscow as a strategic line ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=example%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9Dnew%20Finlandization%E2%80%9C,be%20that%20of%20Murmansk%20Moscow)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=example%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9Dnew%20Finlandization%E2%80%9C,be%20that%20of%20Murmansk%20Moscow)). In fact, he notes that a *Murmansk–Moscow axis* in the far north would be a pillar of Eurasian defense, for example enabling Russia to project into the North Atlantic or Arctic while guarding Scandinavia. Dugin also touches on Finland and Karelia here. He considers **Finland** historically part of the Russian sphere (“naturally a part of the geopolitical space of Russia” as he writes) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L9946%20the%20USSR%2C,Finnish)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=the%20USSR%2C%20i,Finnish)). He even suggests that an optimal arrangement would be re-integrating Finland in some form: he posits giving southern Finland (with its ethnic kin in Karelia) autonomy within Russia, and northern Finland “donated” to Murmansk Oblast (i.e., partitioning Finland) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20base%20of,9)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=base%20of%20the%20U.S.,9)). This of course is extreme and not realistic (especially since Finland was a sovereign state), but it shows Dugin’s mindset of correcting what he views as historical anomalies (Finland broke from the Russian Empire in 1917). In the context of internal geopolitics, Finland is just outside Russia’s borders but culturally linked – Dugin likely views a *Finlandized or friendly Finland* as crucial for securing the extreme northwest and preventing NATO encroachment. Indeed, he calls a scenario of Karelian-Finnish reintegration an example of “new Finlandization” that could benefit Eurasia ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L9998%20regions%20of,Cold%20War%20context)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=regions%20of%20Finland%2C%20Finnish%20Lapland,Cold%20War%20context)). All these points emphasize a secure, Russia-dominated north. Domestically, Dugin also mentions that many northern Russian ethnic groups (like those in Siberia, Finno-Ugric peoples) are more archaic and less influenced by Europe, which to him is a positive – they could form a core of loyal Eurasian people if Moscow ties them in. The “road to the north” is both literal (developing infrastructure in the Arctic) and metaphorical (ensuring Russia’s strategic orientation includes the Arctic dimension). This chapter’s assumptions – that the Arctic will be a key arena and that Russia has an almost predestined right to it – have indeed been borne out to some extent, as we see modern Russia staking strong claims in the Arctic (planting a flag on the seabed, building bases).  

**Chapter 3 – “Calling the East”:** Dugin shifts to Russia’s East – meaning Siberia and the Far East regions (from the Urals to the Pacific). He discusses the concept of the *“Inner East”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L235%20Chapter%203,312)) – probably referring to Siberia as Russia’s internal Asian realm, distinct from the *“Outer East”* (East Asia beyond Russia). He stresses Siberia’s vastness and resources, and the challenge of integrating it fully. The title “Calling the East” suggests rallying or mobilizing the Eastern regions. Main points include: **demographics** – the Russian Far East is sparsely populated and faces a demographic crisis (even in the 90s, Russians worried about Chinese migration or just depopulation). Dugin argues Russia must populate and fortify Siberia, otherwise it will fall under foreign (read: Chinese or Western) influence. He may suggest policies like incentivizing Russian settlers to move east, establishing new cities or economic zones. **Economic integration** – he looks at the *“Russian Siberian belt (structure)”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%20311%20Calling%20the,312)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=3,312)), likely meaning the line of cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway and the new Baikal-Amur Mainline. Dugin advocates investing in East-West infrastructure to bind Siberia to European Russia (so it doesn’t drift economically toward China or Japan). He also likely wants to exploit resources in a controlled way – not letting Western or Chinese companies dominate Siberian oil, gas, timber. **Strategic depth** – Siberia provides strategic depth for Russia’s defense. Dugin mentions that from the Urals to the Pacific, Russia must maintain tight control because any secession or weakness there could allow outside powers a foothold on the continent. He references historic ideas: e.g. some 90s radicals in the East talked of a “Pacific Russia” more open to the US/Japan; Dugin fiercely opposes such centrifugal ideas. He calls for *“Eurasian (Russian) Siberia”* to be solidified. This might entail dividing Siberia and the Far East into large federal units directly loyal to Moscow (interestingly, Putin later created federal districts to oversee regions, including a Far East federal district – a similar logic). Dugin also frames the East in civilizational terms: Siberia is where Russian Orthodox culture met Turko-Mongol cultures. He invokes Lev Gumilev’s notion that Russians and Turkic peoples have a symbiotic relationship forged on the Steppe ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20Eurasian%20ideology%20draws%20an,moving%20force%20of%20a%20rather)). So, part of “calling the East” is also getting local ethnic groups (Tatars, Buryats, Sakha/Yakuts, etc.) to buy into Eurasianism. Dugin likely lauds examples like the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), which is rich in diamonds and largely stable, as models of Eurasian integration (since Yakutia’s leadership often emphasized a unique Eurasian identity within Russia). The underlying assumption is that *if Russia’s eastern half is strong and loyal, no Asian power can easily encroach*. To support his views, Dugin might mention how historically even under the weakest central governments (Time of Troubles, Civil War), Siberia remained under some form of Russian control or was quickly brought back – indicating a natural cohesion. He certainly warns of the opposite too: that neglecting Siberia could lead to it becoming an economic colony of China or the West, a dire strategic loss. Overall, Chapter 3 is a call to arms for internal colonization and unity of Russia’s Asian territories.  

**Chapter 4 – “The New Geopolitical Arrangement of the South”:** This chapter addresses Russia’s south – primarily the Caucasus and the “Mountainous border zones” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20325%20THE%20NEW,327)). In the 90s, Russia’s south was volatile (Chechen war, instability in the North Caucasus, Georgia in chaos and leaning West, etc.). Dugin emphasizes establishing a *“New Geopolitical Order of the South”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20325%20THE%20NEW,327)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=4,327)). Main points: **North Caucasus** – This region within Russia (Chechnya, Dagestan, etc.) had separatism and Islamic insurgency. Dugin insists on the *absolute necessity of keeping the North Caucasus under Moscow’s control*, as it’s the gateway to Transcaucasia. He likely supports harsh measures to defeat Chechen separatists (who by 1997 had de facto independence after a ceasefire). Dugin would argue that allowing an independent Chechnya creates a dangerous precedent and a geopolitical wedge for Turkey or the U.S. to influence the region. Thus, by “new order” he means reasserting federal authority (which indeed happened in 1999 when Putin restarted the Chechen war and ultimately re-integrated Chechnya). **Southern Boundary Zones** – He discusses the mountainous border as a natural defensive line and the peoples there (many of whom are Muslim minorities). Dugin probably advocates a strategy of co-opting local elites (like pro-Russia clans in Dagestan or Ossetian and Abkhaz allies) to secure loyalty, combined with military presence. **Transcaucasus (South Caucasus)** – While Part IV dealt with foreign policy toward independent Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, here he might touch on how domestic public opinion and policy should view those. For instance, fostering Russian patriotism that includes an emotional tie to Caucasus conflicts (presenting the fight in Chechnya or support for Abkhazia as protecting the Motherland). He might also mention the need to integrate culturally – e.g., promote Orthodoxy in the South (with Ossetians, etc.) and manage Islam via friendly muftis to counter Wahhabi influence. **Central Asia’s influence** – The “South” could also broadly include areas like Kazakhstan’s border regions or the broader notion of the steppe frontier. But likely it’s Caucasus-centric. The main claim is to *stabilize the southern frontier to prevent any penetration by Atlanticist influence via Turkey or Islamic radicalism via Middle East*. Evidence he uses: the 1990s show what happens when the south is neglected (Chechnya becomes a haven for militants and foreign fighters by mid-90s, NATO peacekeepers appear just beyond the Caucasus in Bosnia, etc.). Dugin assumes that a strong grip on the south not only secures Russia but also projects power into the Middle East (harking to the old Russian dream of reaching the “warm waters” – which ties back to needing a presence in the South for warm sea access as discussed earlier). By calling it a “New Geopolitical Order,” he suggests a permanent solution: perhaps reshuffling borders or creating new autonomies that align with ethnic realities (for example, he might foresee that if Georgia stays anti-Russian, Russia could recognize breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia – which in fact happened in 2008, reflecting this logic). So domestically, Russia preemptively treats South Ossetians and Abkhaz as quasi-citizens (handing out passports, etc., which they did). In essence, Chapter 4 prescribes an internal/external hybrid strategy: within Russia, crush separatism; just beyond, keep the Caucasus divided so no strong hostile state emerges on Russia’s border.  

**Chapter 5 – “Threat of the West”:** This final chapter in Part V addresses ideological and subversive threats *inside* Russia coming from the West. Dugin distinguishes *“Two Wests”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20347%20Threat%20of,351)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,351)) – likely meaning the external geopolitical West (NATO, etc.) and the internal liberal/pro-Western elements within Russia. He sees a “Atlanticist fifth column” in Russia – pro-West politicians, NGOs, business oligarchs aligned with global finance – as a dire threat. He talks about breaking down the “sanitation cordon” not just geographically but politically ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20347%20Threat%20of,351)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,351)): i.e., eliminating the influence of Western ideas that cordon off Russia from its Eurasian mission. Dugin claims that in the 90s, Russia was nearly “colonized” ideologically by the West (through shock therapy economics, adoption of Western-style democracy, etc.). The *Threat of the West* here is basically Westernization of Russian elites and youth. He argues for a cultural-geopolitical counter-offensive: promoting Eurasianist education, patriotism, perhaps reviving Soviet nostalgia or Orthodox faith as immunity against Western liberalism. This includes purging what he calls the *Mondialist lobby* – pro-globalization technocrats in Moscow. Dugin in fact outlines a scenario of an internal clash: he warns that *hardline Westernizers in Russia (“Mondialists”) might provoke a kind of civil conflict against patriots* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=continental%20solidarity%20against%20the%20Atlanticist,It%20depends)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=All%20this%20suggests%20that%20the,It%20depends)). He essentially predicts something akin to a future “color revolution” attempt, where liberal elites and sponsored activists could try to topple a nationalist government, leading to civil war. In the text, he writes that these pro-Western forces might eventually resort to **“civil war”** against the nationalists if cornered ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=continental%20solidarity%20against%20the%20Atlanticist,It%20depends)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=All%20this%20suggests%20that%20the,It%20depends)). He advises pre-empting this by **“provoking the mondialist lobby to act under its own banner”**, exposing themselves so that patriotic forces can confront and eliminate them decisively ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=enemies%20would%20inevitably%20have%20given,to%20speak%20loudly%20about%20their)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=for%20that%20to%20happen%20it,This)). This is chillingly suggestive: Dugin implies a scenario where the mask of democracy comes off and it boils down to traitors vs patriots inside Russia. He clearly sides with a crackdown – saying any outcome that leaves the “anti-national, Russophobe” forces in play will lead to terrible conflict, so better to choose “the lesser of two evils” and remove them from power and influence entirely (outlaw them ideologically) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=for%20that%20to%20happen%20it,This)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=behalf%20of%20the%20clearly%20defined,analytical%20thinking%2C%20disregard%20for%20the)). In summary, Chapter 5 is a call to **ideological purification and vigilance**. It identifies Western liberal values and agents as enemies just as much as NATO armies – an internal front of the same war. The supporting evidence Dugin might cite: how post-Soviet privatization was guided by Harvard advisers, how Soros Foundation and others were active in Russia (he would say they brainwashed youth), how media was largely Western-influenced until Putin’s era. He also possibly references that most of Yeltsin’s circle were either pro-American or Jews/cosmopolitans (Dugin has anti-Semitic streaks, and indeed some of his allies in the National Bolshevik movement railed against the “Atlanticist-Zionist” oligarchs). The assumption here is *totalizing*: Russia cannot achieve its external aims if it is internally divided or if Western “soft power” undercuts morale. Therefore, a sort of national revolution or at least a consolidation under a patriotic (even authoritarian) consensus is needed. We see how this foreshadows Putin-era behavior: increasing state control of media, expelling or restricting foreign NGOs, promoting nationalism, and marginalizing pro-Western liberals (often denounced as traitors). Dugin basically provided the theoretical justification for those moves as geopolitical necessities. With Chapter 5, Dugin closes the loop: to fight the West outside, Russia must also defeat the West inside. The “West” thus is not a place on a map alone, but an idea and influence that penetrated Russia and must be exorcised for Eurasia to rise.  

## Part VI: Geopolitics of Religion and Conflict (Ch. 1–5) *(Supplemental)*  
*(The structure of the book’s later chapters is a bit unclear, but there is evidence of an additional section dealing with geopolitics of religion, the concept of empire’s legal authority, and a case study of Yugoslavia. We include a brief note on these aspects to be thorough.):*  

After addressing internal geopolitics, Dugin apparently discusses the broader civilizational and ideological dimensions of his vision. He delves into the **geopolitics of the Russian Orthodox realm** vs. the Western Christian world in a chapter sometimes referred to as “Geopolitics of the Government” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L268%20Chapter%201,372)). He examines the historic split between Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic/Protestant) Christianity – calling them the East and West of the *Christian ecumene* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%201%20369%20GEOPOLITICS%20OF,372)). Here Dugin emphasizes Russia’s identity as the heir of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) tradition (“Moscow the Third Rome” motif) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=influence.%5B%209%20%5D%20,individualistic)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=and%20Greece%20%E2%80%93%20,individualistic)). He likely argues that this religious-cultural heritage defines Russia’s geopolitical mission in contrast to the secular, individualistic West. He mentions *“Post-Byzantine Orthodoxy”* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=GEOPOLITICS%20OF%20GOVERNMENT%20,372)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=1,372)), implying that Russia must champion Orthodoxy and perhaps unite Orthodox countries (tying back to his idea of an Orthodox bloc with Greece, Serbia, etc. under Moscow’s wing). This also feeds into legitimizing alliances in the Balkans (Serbia, Greece) and framing the struggle as almost a holy war between traditional faiths and godless liberalism or militant Islam on the other side. Dugin also touches on **state and territory** in ideological terms, distinguishing *“three geopolitical categories”* and types of regionalism ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L282%20Chapter%202,390)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%202%20389%20STATE%20AND,390)) – probably meaning land, people, and ideology as categories, and warning against both right-wing separatism (ethnic nationalism that breaks empire) and left-wing separatism (liberal devolution) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L282%20Chapter%202,390)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,390)). Essentially he advocates a unitary imperial state ideology that transcends smaller nationalisms.  

He then analyzes the **“Near Abroad”** problems (former USSR republics) in theoretical terms, invoking *“laws of Big Space”* and critiquing the U.S. strategy (Pax Americana) in those zones ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L288%20Chapter%203,398)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%20397%20THE%20GEOPOLITICAL,398)). This reiterates that large civilizational spaces (like Eurasia) naturally absorb smaller units unless an outside hegemon (America) props them up – hence, he concludes those states will eventually gravitate back to Russia if American influence is removed ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L288%20Chapter%203,398)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%20397%20THE%20GEOPOLITICAL,398)). 

One intriguing chapter is titled **“Prospects for a Civil War”** ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20Chapter%204,418)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%204%20415%20PROSPECTS%20FOR,418)). We saw some content of this above: Dugin outlines the possibility of internal conflict between globalists and patriots in Russia if tensions heighten ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=continental%20solidarity%20against%20the%20Atlanticist,It%20depends)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=All%20this%20suggests%20that%20the,It%20depends)). He essentially concludes that some form of confrontation is inevitable and even desirable to purge the “mondialists.” He describes how it might unfold and argues that a short, decisive confrontation would be better than a prolonged hidden conflict ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Only%20the%20first%20version%20of,would%20have%20to%20rally%20on)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=enemies%20would%20inevitably%20have%20given,to%20speak%20loudly%20about%20their)). This is less a call for literal civil war than a metaphor for a hard political crackdown. He likely concludes that genuine civil peace in Russia is only possible after one side (preferably the Eurasianists) wins decisively, because compromise with pro-Western forces would “destroy the state” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=continental%20solidarity%20against%20the%20Atlanticist,It%20depends)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=All%20this%20suggests%20that%20the,It%20depends)). This again underscores his hardline stance that liberal-democratic opposition must be eliminated for the greater good of the empire. 

Finally, Dugin includes a **case study: “Geopolitics of the South Slavs’ Conflict”** ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L316%20Chapter%205,430)), analyzing the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. He likely frames the Balkan conflicts (Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo) as a direct result of Atlanticist meddling and the weakness of Eurasian influence after the Soviet collapse. Key points: *Yugoslavia’s breakup was a test-run for Western mondialists to destroy a multi-ethnic state friendly to Russia.* Dugin sympathizes with Serbia (Orthodox, ally of Russia) and views the recognition of Slovenia, Croatia, etc., and NATO’s intervention against Serbia, as a template of what could happen to Russia if it’s weak. He mentions **symbolism in Yugoslavia** ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20429%20GEOPOLITICS%20OF,430)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=GEOPOLITICS%20OF%20THE%20SOUTH%20SLAVES,430)) – perhaps noting how Serbia saw itself as a bastion against the Muslim Ottomans historically, and now against NATO, drawing parallels to Russia’s role. He also analyzes *“the three European powers”* in that conflict ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20429%20GEOPOLITICS%20OF,430)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,430)): presumably Germany (which supported Croatia and Slovenia’s independence early), the Vatican/Italy (supporting Catholic Croatia/Slovenia), and the U.S./NATO (intervening in Bosnia/Kosovo). This triangulation showed how Western Europe and America collaborated to dismantle Yugoslavia – an Orthodox Slavic-led federation – which to Dugin exemplifies the West’s attitude toward any integrative project outside their control. He uses Yugoslavia as a cautionary tale: if Russia doesn’t assert itself, NATO will do to parts of the former Soviet space (like Ukraine or the Caucasus) what it did to Serbia – bomb them and peel them away. Conversely, he sees an opportunity: the resentment in Serbia and uncertainty in the Balkans could be exploited by Russia to gain influence (for example, forging an alliance with Serbia and Republika Srpska in Bosnia as a foothold in Southern Europe, which Russia indeed later pursued). Dugin’s takeaway is that the Balkan wars demonstrated the necessity of a strong Eurasian bloc to protect small nations like the Serbs from the Atlanticists. It also showed the ruthlessness of Atlantic strategy (willingness to bypass UN, use force – which Dugin cites to morally equate any force Russia will use as just balancing the scales). 

By including the Yugoslav case, Dugin grounds his abstract ideas in a 1990s reality that his Russian readers were familiar with. He implies, *“Look, the West destroyed Yugoslavia piece by piece – they will do the same to us if we let them. We must respond in kind on a larger scale.”* This adds urgency and concrete illustration to his thesis. 

In summary, Part VI (or the tail end of the book) reinforces the civilizational and ideological framing (Russia as Orthodox-Eurasian shield vs. the liberal West), the need for internal unity even if by force, and learning from the 90s conflicts like Yugoslavia to prepare for future geopolitical battles. It wraps up the exhaustive tour of Dugin’s geopolitical worldview, ending on the note that Russia faces an existential choice: embrace this Eurasian mission or succumb to division and Western domination. Dugin clearly intends *Foundations of Geopolitics* to be a wake-up call and a handbook for Russian leaders in the new millennium.  

# Geopolitical Theories and Their Adaptation in Dugin’s Framework  
Dugin’s work is deeply rooted in earlier geopolitical theories, which he appropriates and modifies to fit his neo-Eurasianist agenda. Throughout *Foundations of Geopolitics*, he references classic geopolitical strategists – not as historical footnotes, but as the backbone of his own theory. Below, we explore the key theories he draws upon and how he adapts them:

- **Halford Mackinder’s Heartland Theory:** Mackinder’s idea (1904) that control of the “Heartland” (central Eurasia) is the key to world domination is absolutely central to Dugin’s framework. Dugin adopts Mackinder’s fundamental land vs. sea dichotomy wholesale ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Atlanticists%2C%20Dugin%20claims%2C%20are%20the,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). He casts Russia as the natural Heartland power (Mackinder had identified the Russian Empire/Siberia as the core of the Heartland) and the U.S./UK as the lead Sea Powers (the “Outer/Insular Crescent” in Mackinder’s terms). Dugin repeatedly cites Mackinder’s famous maxim and clearly believes history vindicated it – e.g. the Cold War saw the Heartland (USSR) vs. Rimland alliances (NATO) exactly as Mackinder foretold. However, Dugin adapts Mackinder in two ways: **(1)** Mackinder spoke from a British perspective, warning Britain to prevent any single power from ruling the Heartland. Dugin inverts this into a prescriptive goal: Russia *should* strive to rule the Heartland and beyond. He sees it as a guide to what Russia must do (unite Eurasia) rather than something to be prevented ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=threats%20to%20its%20objectives%20in,narratives%20aimed%20at%20the%20Western)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=between%20Russia%20and%20the%20West%E2%80%94from,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). **(2)** Mackinder’s emphasis was geographical determinism, but Dugin overlays ideological/civilizational elements. For Mackinder, Heartland vs. Rimland was largely strategic geography. For Dugin, Heartland (Eurasia) carries a spiritual mission and a set of conservative values, whereas Rimland/Sea power carries liberal “globalist” values – effectively merging Mackinder with Huntington’s civilizational clash. Despite this, the structural logic of Dugin’s global plan (continental alliance vs maritime coalition) is straight Mackinderian. Timothy Snyder notes Dugin “follows closely the ideas of Carl Schmitt” (another theorist) but *also* that Dugin forwards Eurasianist ideology that Mackinder would have recognized – an updated Heartland doctrine ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=to%20the%20worrisome%20rise%20of,17)) ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=century%20to%20draw%20what%20is,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)). Indeed, Mackinder’s influence is evident in Dugin’s focus on Eastern Europe (Mackinder’s “gateway” to Heartland). Dugin’s push to control Ukraine and the Black Sea echoes Mackinder’s stress that Heartland power must not lose its marginal seas. In short, Mackinder provided Dugin the grand chessboard on which to build his neo-imperial strategy. 

- **Nicholas Spykman’s Rimland/Containment Theory:** Dugin engages with Spykman as the flipside of Mackinder. Spykman argued the coastal Rimland around Eurasia was crucial to contain the Heartland. This became the basis of U.S. Cold War strategy (NATO, alliances in Asia). Dugin acknowledges how effective this was – he explicitly references *“Mackinder’s cordon sanitaire from the Baltic to the Balkans”* which Spykman advocated to hem in the USSR ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Dugin adapts this by essentially developing a counter-containment strategy. Where Spykman said control the Rimland to contain Russia, Dugin says break the Rimland to unleash Russia. For instance, Spykman’s theories influenced NATO expansion; Dugin’s response is to “push Great Britain and France away from Europe…and absorb the rest of Europe” into a Russian-led bloc ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=threats%20to%20its%20objectives%20in,narratives%20aimed%20at%20the%20Western)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=between%20Russia%20and%20the%20West%E2%80%94from,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)) – in other words, *flip* the Rimland states to Russia’s side or neutralize them. Dugin even mimics Spykman’s style: Spykman famously said “Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia.” Dugin in practice wants to *control the Rimland* (through alliances or destabilization) *so that Eurasia (Heartland) can rule the world*. He also takes Spykman’s insight that sea powers will use peripheral allies and applies it: thus, Dugin endeavors to strip those allies away (like Turkey, Japan, Western Europe’s coastal states) from the U.S. The logical structure of Dugin’s thinking – break NATO, cause U.S. alliances to crumble – is derived from understanding Spykman’s containment. Another adaptation is how Dugin frames conflicts like Ukraine or Georgia: during the Cold War these were part of the internal Soviet space, but after 1991 they became part of a new Rimland separating Russia from NATO. Dugin often describes these countries as pawns of Atlantic containment (his term “sanitary cordon” is directly borrowed from French strategists and Spykman’s concept ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20347%20Threat%20of,351)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,351))). So he draws on Spykman to identify the weak links to target (Baltics, Balkans, Caucasus, etc.). In effect, Dugin uses Spykman’s map in reverse – whereas Western strategists sought to maintain a ring of pro-West states around Russia, Dugin seeks to shatter that ring. This is how he justifies, for example, Russian support for separatists in the Baltics or Balkans: it’s a necessary offense to destroy the containment architecture. Thus, Spykman’s theory is not rejected by Dugin; it’s acknowledged as true but detrimental to Russia, so he develops an anti-Rimland doctrine: essentially a plan for *“offensive de-containment.”*  

- **Karl Haushofer’s Eurasian Pan-Regions:** Haushofer’s concept of Geopolitik in the 1930s envisaged the world divided into large “pan-regions” dominated by great powers (he saw a German-led European bloc, a Russian-led Eurasian bloc, a Japanese-led East Asia, etc., potentially allied). Dugin explicitly praises the idea of a *“continental bloc” (Achsenzeit alliance) of Germany, Russia, and Japan* ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L2000%20Chapter%207,Karl%20Haushofer%20Continental%20Bloc)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). He essentially lifts Haushofer’s strategic outline and updates it for the 21st century: Russia, rather than Germany, becomes the principal continental power, but it still seeks partnership with Germany (now united and economically powerful) and with Japan (or India) in the East. Dugin adapts Haushofer’s idea of *Lebensraum* as well – not in Nazi racial terms, but in civilizational terms. He argues each great culture needs room to flourish without Anglo-Saxon interference. His Eurasia is a supersized version of Haushofer’s *Mitteleuropa* concept, extending from Dublin to Vladivostok. Haushofer also emphasized the strategic importance of **Central Asia** and a German-Russian link to counter Britain. Dugin fully agrees: his stress on Central Asia being Russia’s backyard and the notion of a Berlin-Moscow axis are straight from Haushofer. One difference: Haushofer believed strongly in German-Japanese cooperation; Dugin, writing when Japan was tied to the US, hedges by considering India as an alternate or additional Asian partner ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)). But he still tries with Japan. Dugin also shares Haushofer’s acceptance of temporarily allying with ideologically different regimes for geopolitical gain (Haushofer, a German, was willing to work with Soviet Russia or court India against the Anglo powers; Dugin likewise is happy to ally with Iran or China short-term despite differing ideology). Another adaptation is Dugin’s integration of *race and culture*: Haushofer, being in Nazi milieu, did reference racial aspects (Aryan connection between Germans and some Asians). Dugin doesn’t foreground race in that way, but he does occasionally use terms like “Aryan Armenians and Iranians” ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,9)) to frame alliances. He is more focused on cultural ideology (traditional societies vs Atlantic liberal) than pure race. Still, the influence is clear: Dugin’s Eurasianism is in many respects a successor to Haushofer’s vision of a Euro-Asiatic block. This is why some critics label Dugin neo-fascist – because he echoes fascist-era geopolitics ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Hoover%20Institution%20%20senior%20fellow,17)). Indeed, John Dunlop notes the book’s impact shows a *“worrisome rise of neo-fascist ideas”* among Russian elites ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Hoover%20Institution%20%20senior%20fellow,17)), and Dugin’s debt to thinkers like Haushofer (and Schmitt) is a big part of that fascistic genealogy. Dugin basically rehabilitates Haushofer (who was discredited after WWII) as a prophet of multipolarity. 

- **Carl Schmitt’s Concept of Großraum and Friend-Enemy Distinction:** Schmitt’s influence is philosophical but crucial. Schmitt argued that the world should be divided into large spaces (Großräume) each under a regional power that sets its own order (this was meant to justify Nazi German domination of Europe as a legal “large space” doctrine). Dugin eagerly borrows this to assert that *each civilization (Eurasia, Euro-America, East Asia, etc.) should have sovereignty in its region, with non-interference from others* – a direct challenge to the universalist liberal order ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=century%20to%20draw%20what%20is,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)). Schmitt also posited that liberalism obscures the fundamental *friend vs. enemy* nature of politics. Dugin adapts this stark view to international affairs: he frames global politics as inherently a life-or-death struggle between irreconcilable powers or value-systems. This underpins his justification for extreme measures (like subversion and war) – because in Schmitt’s terms, the opponent (Atlanticists) is an existential enemy, not just a competitor ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20a%20moment%20of%20exultant,be%20exaggerated%2C%20it%20also%20should)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=in%20his%20book%2C%20,in)). Snyder points out Dugin closely follows Schmitt, the “leading Nazi political theorist” ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=to%20the%20worrisome%20rise%20of,17)) ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=century%20to%20draw%20what%20is,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)), in rejecting the post-WWII rules-based order. Dugin’s notion of a *“conservative revolution”* and his disdain for international law (“contempt for international borders and law” as Dunlop describes it ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=in%20his%20book%2C%20,in)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=geopolitics%20to%20the%20speaker%20of,in))) come straight from Schmittian thinking – that law is just the will of the powerful, and a new law (Nomos) can be imposed by a rising power. By invoking Schmitt, Dugin provides an intellectual rationale to cast aside the norms erected after 1945 (sovereign equality of states, inviolability of borders, etc.) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). In their place, he proposes a return to a 19th-century style competition of empires, albeit cloaked in modern civilizational terms. Schmitt also influenced Dugin’s idea of *Eurasian legal order vs. Atlantic legal order* – e.g., he might argue that within Eurasia, different rules (authoritarian, collective rights over individual) would apply, and that is fine because each Großraum sets its Nomos. This resonates with current Russian claims of a unique “Eurasian democracy” or Chinese claims of “Asian values” – all rejecting universal human-rights doctrine. Another Schmittian adaptation is Dugin’s emphasis on *decisionism* – the need for a decisive sovereign (in Russia’s case, a strong ruler or elite) to take charge in crisis. Dugin’s internal geopolitics section, where he speaks of possibly outlawing opposition and choosing “the lesser of two evils” by suppressing pro-West forces ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=for%20that%20to%20happen%20it,This)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=behalf%20of%20the%20clearly%20defined,analytical%20thinking%2C%20disregard%20for%20the)), is channeling Schmitt’s idea that in an emergency, the sovereign must act outside normal law to save the state. Thus, Schmitt’s theories are used by Dugin to legitimize authoritarian power and regional imperialism under an intellectual veneer. Snyder notes that Eurasianism (Dugin’s creed) is essentially combining fascist and Stalinist ideas, and Schmitt’s conservative international order concept (with spheres of influence for great powers) heavily influenced Dugin ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=to%20the%20worrisome%20rise%20of,17)). 

- **Classical Eurasianist Thought (Trubetzkoy, Savitsky, Gumilev):** Dugin draws not only from Western geopolitical strategists but also from Russian Eurasianist ideology of the 1920s and Soviet times. From Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Pyotr Savitsky, he takes the core notion that *Russia is fundamentally a Eurasian, not European, civilization*. Savitsky’s idea of *Mestorazvitie* (place-development) posited that the geographic unity of Eurasia creates an organic cultural unit – Dugin echoes this by describing the former USSR as a natural “big space” destined to reintegrate ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%209%2071%20Pyotr%20Savitsky,72)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%209%2071%20Pyotr%20Savitsky,72)). Trubetzkoy’s rejection of Western cultural superiority is mirrored in Dugin’s ferocious anti-Western stance (Trubetzkoy considered European culture just one of many, not a universal model, which Dugin reinforces). Lev Gumilev’s theory of *passionarity* (some nations have surges of collective energy for expansion) is used by Dugin to argue that Russians still have the vitality to lead an empire ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%206%20135%20Neo,138)). He implies that the chaotic 90s were a low point but a new “passionary” rise is imminent (possibly embodied by Putin’s generation). Gumilev also advocated an alliance of steppe peoples and Russians, which Dugin interprets as justification for including Turkic and Muslim areas in Eurasia cooperatively. By invoking these theorists, Dugin adapts their more academic/historical concepts into a political program: Eurasianists originally were intellectuals in exile, not policymakers. Dugin effectively weaponized their cultural insights into geopolitical arguments. For example, because Eurasianists said Russia isn’t European, Dugin says therefore Russia should form its own bloc with Asians and not integrate with the EU. Because Gumilev romanticized the Mongol influence on Russia (seeing it as positive), Dugin is comfortable aligning with Kazakhstan or even the Taliban if it hurts the West. In essence, he takes the Eurasianist celebration of Russia’s hybridity and turns it into a geopolitical rallying cry: *“We are not the West, we have our own space and destiny – thus we will build our own empire.”* This is a subtle but powerful adaptation of what started as a cultural philosophy into realpolitik. 

- **Alfred Thayer Mahan’s Sea Power theory:** While Dugin’s heart lies with land power, he doesn’t ignore Mahan. He uses Mahan’s emphasis on naval strength to characterize the U.S. and UK as naturally aggressive sea powers that form global coalitions (like the UK historically did) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). Dugin adapts Mahan mainly to underscore what Russia is *not* (Russia is not a commercial sea-trading power) and to highlight the challenge: unless the Eurasian landmass unites, the seapowers can encircle it. He often calls Britain and the U.S. “thalassocracies” and Russia a “tellurocracy” ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20presents%20the%20world%20order,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). These terms come from ancient Greek history (Athens vs Sparta) but also reflect Mahan’s world of naval empires vs land empires. Dugin might dispute some of Mahan’s implications – e.g., Mahan believed sea power could ultimately subdue land powers via blockade and economic force; Dugin counters that a self-sufficient Eurasia could withstand that, especially with nuclear weapons leveling the field. But in general, Dugin doesn’t so much adapt Mahan’s theory as use it as a foil. Mahan helps Dugin explain why the Atlanticists behave as they do (establishing bases, dominating sea lanes, promoting free trade – all things Mahan advocated). Dugin then says: *we land powers must do the opposite – dominate the continents and deny the seapowers access.* This leads him to propose, for instance, closing the Bosphorus (through control of Turkey or its destruction) to lock the U.S. out of the Black Sea, or using submarines in the Arctic to threaten U.S. navies. Those ideas are applications of counter-sea-power strategy influenced by Mahan’s identification of strategic chokepoints (like Suez, Panama, Turkish Straits – all of which Dugin talks about controlling via allies or military means). 

- **Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations (Neo-Atlantism):** Although Huntington (1996) was an American political scientist, Dugin discusses his thesis as an example of Atlanticist thought admitting to civilizational blocs ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=C,111)). Huntington said post-Cold War conflict would be along civilizational lines (West vs. Orthodox, Islamic, Sinic, etc.). Dugin welcomes this framing because it justifies the kind of bloc politics he wants, but he adapts it by insisting *Russia should lead a coalition of non-Western civilizations against the West*, rather than clash with each non-Western civilization separately. Huntington saw Russia potentially at odds with Islamic or Chinese civilizations; Dugin instead tries to bind Orthodox (Russia) with Islamic (Iran, etc.) and even possibly Confucian (if China could be co-opted) against the West. In that sense, Dugin modifies Huntington by pushing for a ** Eurasian-Islamic alliance** (Huntington would likely be surprised by “Russia + Islam = salvation of Europe” ideas ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5))). Dugin also rejects Huntington’s implicit suggestion that Russia is part of a lesser “Orthodox civilization” subordinate to Western power; instead Dugin claims Orthodoxy as a core pole. Essentially, Dugin takes the multipolar lens of Huntington (civilizational blocks) but gives it a strongly anti-West revolutionary twist: rather than each civilization just minding its own affairs (Huntington was not exactly prescribing war, just predicting fault lines), Dugin advocates an active *campaign* by the Eurasian (and allied) civilizations to topple the Western dominance. It’s more aggressive and messianic than Huntington. Nonetheless, Dugin does credit concepts like “the West and the Rest,” turning them into a strategy of uniting “the Rest” against “the West.” This synergy of Huntington with Mackinder/Schmitt results in Dugin’s portrayal of the world as fundamentally divided, with compromise unlikely – thus echoing the friend-enemy dichotomy in more cultural terms. 

In summary, Dugin’s genius – or dangerous talent – lies in how he synthesized over a century of geopolitical thought into a coherent (if extreme) framework for Russian action. He adapts classical theories by infusing them with Russian nationalist and Eurasianist ideology. Mackinder’s clear geographic determinism becomes in Dugin’s hands a civilizational struggle. Haushofer’s continental alliance concept is resurrected as a guide for 21st-century diplomacy. Schmitt’s stark legal and moral relativism undergirds Dugin’s justification for breaking rules and pursuing a might-makes-right ethos. The result is a hybrid theory: **Geo-politics meets Civilizational War**, where land and sea powers clash not just for resources but for ideological survival. Dugin’s adaptations sometimes distort the original theorists (e.g., turning Spykman’s warning into a blueprint to actually do what he warned against), but this selective use of past theories gives his work an air of intellectual weight and historical inevitability. He frequently footnotes these thinkers to show continuity – as if to say, “Geopolitical science *proves* Russia must do this” ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). This appropriation of geopolitical canon is a key reason *Foundations of Geopolitics* struck Russian strategists as more sober and credible than Dugin’s earlier mystical writings ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,modern%20occult%20movements%2C%20and%20the)). It couches radical ideas in the respectable language of Mackinder and Schmitt, which likely helped it gain acceptance in military academies and among hardline intellectuals.  

# Logical Evaluation of Dugin’s Arguments (Contradictions, Weaknesses, Counterpoints)  
While Dugin’s grand vision is sweeping and internally consistent, it is riddled with logical contradictions, questionable assumptions, and practical weaknesses. Here we critically evaluate his main arguments:

**1. Ideological Contradictions (Anti-“Globalism” vs. Russian Expansionism):** Dugin positions himself as a staunch anti-globalist and accuses the West of imposing a homogenizing “Mondialist” agenda ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=2,115)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Mondialism%20,112)). Yet, his solution is to construct a Russian-led empire that spans continents – in effect, a different flavor of hegemony. This is a core contradiction: he condemns the American unipolar sphere for violating nations’ sovereignty, but openly advocates dismantling or subjugating many sovereign states (Ukraine, the Baltic countries, Kazakhstan, etc.) under Russian dominance ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=base%20of%20the%20U.S.,9)). In other words, *Dugin’s Eurasianism is “anti-imperialist” in rhetoric but explicitly imperialist in practice*. For example, he rails against NATO expansion as illegitimate, but sees no issue with Russia outright annexing territory (calling for annexation of Ukraine’s east and absorption of Belarus and Moldova ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L550%20unacceptable.,in%20the%20Eurasian%20sphere)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness))). This hypocrisy undercuts the moral and logical consistency of his argument. If one truly values a multipolar world of independent cultures, why eliminate the independence of neighbors to create a giant pole? Dugin tries to square this by claiming those nations “naturally” belong to Russia’s civilization, but this is the same logic colonial powers used. The counterpoint is obvious: *replacing one empire with another does not free the world, it just changes the master*. 

**2. Overestimation of Russia’s Capacity:** Dugin assumes Russia has the economic, military, and political capacity to execute this monumental strategy. In 1997, Russia was economically feeble and in political disarray – a far cry from the robust engine needed to lead a pan-continental coalition. Even today, Russia’s GDP and population are fractions of the combined West or rising China. Critics note that *Dugin’s vision is grandiose beyond Russia’s means – a “complete fantasy” that “fails to understand international dynamics”*, as one commentator put it ([The Eurasian Bloc as envisioned by Russian theorist Aleksandr Dugin (Moscow-Berlin-Tokyo Axis) : r/imaginarymaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/x7rz8o/the_eurasian_bloc_as_envisioned_by_russian/#:~:text=No_Seaworthiness5445)) ([The Eurasian Bloc as envisioned by Russian theorist Aleksandr Dugin (Moscow-Berlin-Tokyo Axis) : r/imaginarymaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/x7rz8o/the_eurasian_bloc_as_envisioned_by_russian/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). For instance, Dugin advocates courting Germany and Japan simultaneously ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally)) – but in reality Russia’s economic incentives to lure them are limited compared to the U.S. and its security guarantees are less credible (especially after Russia’s own military struggles in places like Chechnya and later Ukraine). Another example: he wants to partition China ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=In%20East%20%20and%20,379)) – an almost laughable notion given China’s strength; if anything, the reverse (China nibbling at Siberia) was a concern. His plan requires Russia to successfully fight on multiple fronts: politically subverting Europe, militarily pressuring its neighbors, competing in the Middle East, and conducting espionage in North America – all at once. This multi-front ambition would stretch a superpower, let alone a Russia that, in the 90s, couldn’t fully subdue Chechnya internally. A logical evaluation finds that Dugin severely underestimates the *resource constraint*. He writes as if willpower and ideology alone can trump material limits. Counterpoint: historically, overextension has been the downfall of empires (Napoleon, Hitler, even the USSR to some extent). Dugin’s Eurasian empire, if attempted, might collapse under its own weight, especially if it triggers balancing coalitions against it (e.g., unified Western opposition, which we indeed see after Russia’s moves in Ukraine). 

**3. Ignoring Nuclear Deterrence and Modern Warfare Realities:** Dugin’s aggressive military suggestions (e.g. dismembering Turkey, waging wars in the Caucasus, instigating civil conflicts in NATO countries) largely sidestep the fact that nuclear weapons create huge risks in great-power confrontation. For instance, NATO’s security guarantee (Article 5) is backed by nuclear powers; a Russian-fomented uprising in, say, the Baltics could escalate uncontrollably. Dugin plans as if wars can be compartmentalized or proxies used freely, but the logic of deterrence suggests any direct attack on NATO members or allies could invite devastating retaliation. He’s notably silent on how to avoid nuclear war in pursuing these maximalist goals – a glaring weakness since the post-WWII order he hates was largely shaped to avoid world wars under nuclear shadow. Moreover, modern warfare includes economic war: Dugin discounts how the West could respond with crippling sanctions (as seen after 2014 and 2022, which have isolated Russia economically to a degree Dugin perhaps didn’t anticipate). Also, while he emphasizes psychological and subversive warfare (which is prescient in terms of cyber and information war), he underestimates opponents’ capacity to do the same. For example, encouraging separatism in the U.S. ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make)) could equally prompt the U.S. to fuel separatism in Russia (Chechnya, Tatarstan) – indeed Western NGOs supported democracy movements in Russia, which Putin viewed as subversive. There’s an assumption in Dugin that Russia can act aggressively without severe blowback, which is not logically sound. The events following some implementation of his ideas (like sanctions after Crimea, NATO’s renewed unity after the 2022 invasion) demonstrate that adversaries won’t passively let Russia pick them off. Internal contradiction arises: Dugin’s method to avoid nuclear war is unclear. He sometimes hints at using Russia’s nuclear status to *deter* intervention while it picks apart the periphery (i.e., a shield for its conventional revisionism). But that’s a dangerous brinkmanship which could miscalculate into nuclear exchange – something Dugin’s analysis, with its quasi-romantic view of conflict, doesn’t grapple with fully. 

**4. Unrealistic Assumptions about Allies and Enemies’ Reactions:** Dugin’s plan hinges on many other countries acting exactly as he hopes. This is a critical weakness: the agency of other nations is often glossed over or assumed away. For example, he expects Germany and France to *“see the light”* and join Russia against the U.S. ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=threats%20to%20its%20objectives%20in,for%20Europe%20is%20not%20all)). In reality, Germany and France have deep ties to the U.S. and NATO, and while they have occasional disagreements, the idea of them aligning with a revanchist Russia is far-fetched, especially if Russia is threatening their EU neighbors. The EU’s very foundation is collective security and interdependence; Dugin imagines he can break that with ease. The counterpoint is that Russian belligerence (like invading Ukraine) actually *pushes Europe closer to the U.S.*, as fear overrides any temptation for neutrality. Indeed, after 2022, Europe became more unified and militarily aligned with the U.S. than it had been in decades – precisely opposite Dugin’s desired “Finlandization” of Europe ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)). Similarly, he assumes Japan would flip if offered carrots like the Kurils ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Indochina%20%20,9)), underestimating Japan’s wariness of Russia and reliance on U.S. security (especially with China and N.Korea threats). He assumes India would join an anti-West bloc, ignoring that India values a multi-aligned strategy and won’t be anyone’s junior partner – India still engages with the U.S. and West heavily (despite buying Russian arms). On the enemy side, Dugin presumes the U.S. would be too divided or reluctant to respond effectively. However, one might counter that the U.S., when faced with a clear geopolitical threat, historically mobilizes enormously (as in WWII or the Cold War). His suggestion to stoke multiple insurgencies in the U.S. might cause turmoil, but could also backfire and unite Americans against a known external enemy if exposed (like how 9/11 attacks unified the country temporarily, or how revelations of Russian election meddling in 2016 sparked some backlash). Furthermore, many of Dugin’s proposals (like splitting Turkey with Iran) assume unlikely cooperation – Iran and Russia might align generally, but Iran pursuing territorial expansion into Azerbaijan or Turkey could provoke other conflicts that Russia can’t control. Dugin’s world doesn’t account for *the possibility of misalignment or betrayal among his proposed allies*. For instance, if Russia weakened NATO, might not China, rather than Russia, become the bigger beneficiary? Dugin wants to contain China, but his strategy of undermining Western power could just create a vacuum that China fills, especially in Central Asia – a scenario unfavorable to Russia. Thus, there’s an internal inconsistency: he needs China weak to dominate Eurasia, but needs Western hegemony weakened which might strengthen China relatively. These cross-dependencies highlight the plan’s fragility. 

**5. Moral and Ethical Issues (Means to Ends):** From a logical standpoint of persuasive argument, Dugin’s unabashed endorsement of subversion, proxy wars, and authoritarian control raises moral red flags that undermine his credibility outside his target audience. He advocates actions that are essentially war crimes or human rights violations: e.g., *supporting racist and extremist groups* in other countries to destabilize them ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)), or provoking wars that would kill thousands. He even suggests using one enemy (radical Islamists) to hurt another (the West), which ethically and pragmatically is playing with fire (as seen by the way US support to Afghan mujahideen in the 80s later spawned problems). A logical critique is that methods which sow chaos (terrorism, racial strife) could lead to uncontrollable blowback, including on Russia itself (Jihadism, once strengthened, also hit Russia). By being so open about these destructive tactics, Dugin also provides a moral justification for his enemies to isolate or oppose Russia robustly; it’s basically a repudiation of international norms. So, while Dugin might not care about Western opinion, this limits his appeal – few outside ultra-nationalist circles will find such Machiavellian strategy acceptable. It’s logically hard to argue that a stable world order can arise from deliberate promotion of chaos. The ends-means inconsistency is visible: he claims to want a more *just, multipolar world*, but the means he’s willing to use (fomenting civil wars, aligning with any “devils” against the West) could lead to massive human suffering and global instability. If all powers behaved as he advises Russia to, the result would be perpetual conflict – which contradicts his eventual vision of a stable Eurasian-led order. There’s a sense that Dugin is so focused on *destroying* the current order that he doesn’t fully consider how to *build* a peaceful alternative – besides vague notes on a “multipolar” world, he is essentially advocating continuous aggressive maneuvers. This could devolve into the very Hobbesian nightmare (all-against-all war) that he claims the immoral West is causing. 

**6. Internal Social Contradictions:** Dugin’s image of a mobilized, ideologically united Russian society (through Eurasianist nationalism) ignores Russia’s internal diversity and dissent. For instance, he preaches Orthodox-traditional unity, but Russia is multi-religious (significant Muslim population) and multi-ethnic. While Dugin includes Muslims in his external alliance, internally his Russian Orthodoxy emphasis could alienate non-Slavs. There’s a contradiction in trumpeting a grand Eurasian empire that includes Central Asians and Caucasians, while also rallying ethnic Russians with somewhat chauvinist rhetoric (Dugin sometimes voices contempt for Ukrainians or others). The risk is that his approach could actually exacerbate internal fractures – the opposite of what he intends. In the 1990s, many non-Russian regions were wary of Moscow; forcing an imperial ideology might reignite those tensions (e.g., Tatarstan’s autonomy demands). Dugin’s solution is heavy-handed suppression of any “mondialist” or separatist elements ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=for%20that%20to%20happen%20it,This)). But suppressing dissent can breed resentment, potentially sparking the civil conflict he claims to prevent. Moreover, logically, if his vision is so appealing, why would it require silencing so many voices? The need for authoritarian measures suggests a lack of organic support across Russia’s populace. Indeed, the fact that Dugin’s most extreme ideas were not openly embraced by Putin for years (Putin co-opted some but not all) indicates even Russian leaders see limits to how far society can go. 

**7. Time Inconsistencies and Sequence Risks:** Dugin’s plan is extremely ambitious in scope and requires careful sequencing (e.g., form alliance with Germany before picking a fight with NATO, destabilize U.S. after securing Eurasia, etc.). However, he doesn’t clearly address the sequencing beyond broad strokes. There’s a logical risk if steps happen in the wrong order or too slowly/quickly. For example, if Russia antagonizes the West (e.g., by invading neighbors) *before* solidifying its alliance with major powers like Germany or China, it could face isolation and superior opposition (which is what indeed happened post-Crimea: Russia had not secured a strong alliance with a major power, and found itself relatively isolated except for China’s lukewarm partnership). Or if Russia engages in multiple conflicts simultaneously (say, in Europe and the Caucasus and against Turkey), it might provoke a unified response it can’t handle. Dugin tends to speak of many objectives almost in parallel; real-world strategy usually requires prioritization. The absence of a clear phased roadmap is a weakness – he almost assumes a cascade of successes without acknowledging that any early failure could unravel the whole design. A counter-strategy by opponents could be to “divide and deter” – strengthen NATO unity while peeling away potential allies like India with better offers, which undercuts Dugin’s plan at the root. Logically, his grand strategy is vulnerable if even a couple of key pillars (Germany’s defection, or Turkey’s destabilization, etc.) don’t materialize. It’s a high-risk, high-reward gamble with little room for error. 

**8. Reaction to Modern Developments (Counterpoints from Reality):** Since publication, parts of Dugin’s agenda have been tested. Where implemented, they have often produced results contrary to his aims, highlighting weaknesses. A prime example: **Ukraine**. Dugin insisted Ukraine must be annexed or at least neutralized ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)). Russia’s attempts (Crimea annexation 2014, war in Donbas, full invasion 2022) were partially successful territorially, but they galvanized Ukraine’s national identity strongly against Russia, essentially “losing” the chance of a friendly Ukraine for generations. They also strengthened NATO (Finland and Sweden joined NATO – a complete reversal of “Finlandization” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=The%20prerequisite%20is%20that%20all,In%20the)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=powers,It%20can%20strike%20and%20receive))). So the counterpoint is that Dugin’s aggressive approach can backfire strategically. NATO’s expansion after 2014, the EU’s renewed purpose, and the West’s sanctions unity all serve as empirical refutations of the idea that pushing hard would crumble Western resolve. In fact, many of Dugin’s assumed weak links (Germany, which he thought would break from NATO due to gas dependence) have surprised by taking tougher stances when provoked (Germany halting pipelines and boosting defense after 2022). This reveals a flaw in Dugin’s assessment of Western politics – he underestimated their resilience and principles. Similarly, **Turkey** did not break up or turn against NATO due to Russian machinations; instead, after some incidents (like Turkey shooting a Russian jet in 2015), Russia had to tread carefully and even court Turkey (selling S-400 missiles) rather than purely undermine it. This shows the real world complexity – Turkey could not be simply bullied; it had leverage of its own. **China**: Dugin’s suggestion to partition China never had any traction; instead, Russia ended up needing China’s goodwill to survive Western sanctions – an ironic twist that Dugin’s framework didn’t prioritize. This suggests his prioritization (targeting the West first, leaving China for later) might inadvertently make Russia a junior partner to China, which is a strategic fail for his idea of Russian dominance. **Internal politics**: Putin’s Russia did incorporate some of Dugin’s repressive and nationalist elements, but carefully. There was no outright “civil war” purge; rather a gradual marginalization of liberals. This more cautious approach might be seen as a partial validation (the state did act against “mondialist” NGOs etc.), but also a sign that even Kremlin strategists find Dugin’s open calls for civil strife too destabilizing. Indeed, Dugin himself was reportedly sidelined from direct influence at times precisely because the Kremlin didn’t want his more extremist followers destabilizing things beyond control. 

In essence, a logical evaluation shows Dugin’s worldview is highly deterministic and simplistically binary (Eurasia good, Atlanticism evil) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20a%20moment%20of%20exultant,be%20exaggerated%2C%20it%20also%20should)). Reality is more fluid; nations have multiple interests and identities. Dugin’s prescriptions ignore the capacity of people and nations to choose their own alignments in non-zero-sum ways. For instance, many countries want good relations with both West and Russia/China (India, Turkey to some extent, even Germany tried a “Wandel durch Handel” approach with Russia). Dugin’s all-or-nothing stance pushes them to pick sides – often not Russia’s side if forced. This inflexibility is a strategic weakness because it doesn’t allow for incremental gains or soft power; it assumes loyalty or enmity with no middle ground, which is not how international diplomacy often works. 

**Counterpoints from other thinkers:** Many Russian strategists and Western analysts counter Dugin’s arguments on practical grounds. For example, contemporary strategist Dmitri Trenin argued that Russia must integrate with the world economy and cannot afford a new cold war – directly opposing Dugin’s autarkic, confrontational approach. Marlene Laruelle, an expert on Eurasianism, points out that Dugin’s vision, while influential rhetorically, does not translate well into state policy without significant adaptation, as Russia’s actual foreign policy has had to be opportunistic and pragmatic rather than purely ideological. Even within the Russian military, some may admire the sweep of Dugin’s thought but doubt its feasibility – the Russian General Staff might study his book but also realize the risk of fighting on too many fronts. 

In conclusion, while Dugin’s *Foundations of Geopolitics* presents an internally consistent worldview, its execution would face severe logical and practical challenges. Internal contradictions (fighting “imperialism” by imperialism, aligning with Islamists while championing Orthodoxy, etc.) could undermine cohesion. External counter-actions and realities (alliances forming against aggression, the deterrence of nuclear and economic power, the independent agency of target states) significantly weaken the likelihood of success. Dugin’s arguments can thus be seen as more provocative and aspirational than truly realistic strategy. They serve as a radical critique of the status quo and a call to arms, but as a blueprint they are fraught with peril and paradox. The very “harsh and cynical” nature of his vision, as Dunlop notes ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)), means it harks back to destructive interwar geopolitics that ultimately led to catastrophe – an outcome modern logic and historical experience would urge Russia (or any state) to avoid repeating.  

# Historical Context and Real-World Implications  

**Historical Context (1990s Russia):** *Foundations of Geopolitics* emerged in 1997, at a time when Russia was reeling from the Soviet Union’s collapse and struggling to define its place in a unipolar world. Internally, the 90s were marked by economic turmoil, loss of empire, and a sense of humiliation as NATO expanded eastward and the West advised Russia’s reforms. Dugin’s work can be seen as a reaction to this context – a bombastic answer to what many Russian nationalists viewed as a decade of weakness under Yeltsin. He offered a *“new Russian Idea”* or ideology for a resurgent Russia ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=interwar%20emigre%20Eurasian%20writer%2C%20Prince,dawn%20of%20a%20new%20millennium)) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=It%20seemed%20that%20Dugin%20saw,dawn%20of%20a%20new%20millennium)), tapping into a vacuum left by the discrediting of Marxism-Leninism. The popularity of his book among military and security elites ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=book%20by%20Aleksandr%20Dugin%20,6)) reflects a yearning in the late Yeltsin/early Putin era for a grand strategy to restore Russian greatness. Dugin’s calls aligned with the sentiments of hardliners who felt Russia had been too compliant with Western encroachment. For instance, NATO’s intervention in Bosnia (1995) and plans for NATO enlargement to Poland, Czech Republic, etc., were fresh in Russian minds – Dugin cites these as evidence of a Western plot to dominate. In 1997, also, Zbigniew Brzezinski’s *The Grand Chessboard* was published, openly discussing how the U.S. should manage Eurasia to keep its hegemony. Dugin references such Western writings to stoke urgency: he frames his doctrine as necessary counter-measures. Historically, his book also follows the Chechen War (1994-96) which Russia lost badly – this humiliation likely informed his emphasis on reasserting control internally and in the Caucasus. Internationally, 1997 was the dawn of unipolarity debates; the Primakov doctrine (named after Yevgeny Primakov, foreign minister then) was calling for multipolarity and a Russia-India-China triangle. Dugin’s ideas were a more extreme version of this multipolar push – Primakov wanted diplomatic balancing, Dugin wanted full confrontation to create poles. 

**Influence on Russian Foreign Policy:** The extent of Dugin’s direct influence is debated. He wasn’t an official advisor at the highest level (Putin has never officially endorsed Dugin’s more occult or fascist leanings). However, *Foundations of Geopolitics* reportedly became part of the curriculum for senior military officers ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=police%20forces%20%2C%20and%20,6)), indicating it shaped the worldview of many in Russia’s armed forces and security community. Gennadiy Seleznyov, Duma speaker, even suggested making Dugin’s geopolitics part of school curricula ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=foundation%20for%20preparing%20a%20new,9)). That suggests an ideological penetration. By the 2000s, elements of Dugin’s strategy began reflecting in policy: Putin’s administration (especially after 2003-04) pivoted to a more assertive stance, opposing NATO expansion (red-line on Georgia/Ukraine by 2008), seeking to build the Eurasian Economic Union (a mild version of Dugin’s “Eurasian Empire”), and courting powers like China, India, Iran into closer alignment. It’s important to note Putin’s policies are more realpolitik and less grandiose than Dugin’s blueprint, but *the general direction – resisting U.S. unipolarity and restoring influence over former Soviet space – aligns closely with Dugin’s doctrine.* Analysts have pointed out that events like the 2008 war in Georgia and the 2014 seizure of Crimea seem to follow the *Foundations of Geopolitics* playbook ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=match%20at%20L559%20West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)): Dugin had explicitly argued that Georgia should be dismantled (he even suggested dividing it among neighbors) and that Ukraine should be annexed in the east ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)). Indeed, Dugin was personally vocal during 2014, present in Crimea and Donbas rallying support; he famously said, “Novorossiya (Eastern Ukraine) is an essential part of Eurasia.” While it’s not that Putin needed Dugin to tell him these areas were strategically important, Dugin’s framing gave a kind of intellectual justification for such moves, which Russian nationalists and state media sometimes echoed (e.g., calling Ukraine an artificial state with “no real nationhood” – almost quoting Dugin ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness))). The idea of *“common enemy unites”* became a rhetoric in Russian propaganda too, as anti-Americanism was ramped up in domestic messaging, very much in line with Dugin’s concept that a new empire must be built on opposing Atlanticism ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)). 

**Formation of Eurasian Institutions:** In the 2010s, Russia indeed spearheaded the **Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)** with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and later Kyrgyzstan – a direct attempt to integrate the post-Soviet space economically and politically. While this union is far more benign (on the surface) than Dugin’s imperial conquest, it resonates with his Part III goal of “gathering the empire” in a modern form. Marlene Laruelle and others have noted that Eurasianism moved from fringe to semi-official discourse as Putin spoke of a “Eurasian Union” (Putin used that term in 2011 op-ed). It’s likely that Dugin’s decades of advocacy helped popularize the concept that such integration is Russia’s destiny (though one could argue the idea was obvious to any geopolitical thinker, Dugin provided a ready-made ideological packaging). Additionally, Russia’s insistence on a “sphere of privileged interests” in the CIS (stated by President Medvedev in 2008) sounds like a watered-down version of Dugin’s Großraum concept – essentially telling the West to butt out of ex-Soviet states. Western analysts often mention Dugin when describing Russia’s urge to dominate its neighborhood and push back NATO, citing *Foundations of Geopolitics* as a blueprint that foretold these actions ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Soviet%20era,also%20used%20the%20symbol%20as)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=eccentric%20metaphysics%20,19)). 

**Information Warfare and Political Interference:** Perhaps the area where Dugin’s real-world impact is clearest is Russia’s use of *“active measures”* and information warfare in the West. Dugin’s specific proposals to fuel separatism and social conflicts in the U.S. and Europe ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=,It%20would%20also%20make)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)) eerily prefigure documented Russian interference from 2014 onward – including troll farms spreading divisive content on social media, cyber hacks releasing damaging info to polarize elections, and support (financial or propagandistic) to far-right and far-left parties in Europe. For instance, Russia gave loans to France’s far-right National Front, cultivated relationships with Hungary’s Jobbik, Italy’s Northern League, and others – all aimed at undermining EU/NATO consensus. The Internet Research Agency’s campaigns in the U.S. sought to inflame racial tensions (even organizing both pro-Black Lives Matter and pro-confederate rallies to get Americans fighting) – exactly like Dugin’s suggestion to provoke “Afro-American racists” and extremists to cause chaos ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=political%20state%20of%20affairs%20in,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)). While we cannot say Russian operators sat with Dugin’s book and followed it line by line, the *congruence* is striking and suggests the ideas percolated into strategic thinking. The concept of supporting separatism also played out: Russia openly supported Catalonian separatists (at least in media disinformation) to annoy NATO-member Spain, and voiced sympathy for Scottish independence to weaken the UK. Dugin had explicitly listed these regions as targets ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,is%20not%20all%20that%20fantastical)). Even in the Americas, Russia built ties with anti-U.S. leftist regimes (Venezuela, Bolivia) – echoing Dugin’s note to expand influence in Latin America ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=sense%20simultaneously%20to%20support%20isolationist,9)). Thus, the real-world implication has been a deterioration of Western domestic cohesion to a degree, and Western agencies becoming far more vigilant about Russian hybrid warfare. Many analysts in NATO countries now take Dugin’s type of threats seriously, developing defenses against disinformation and cyber attacks. In effect, Dugin’s playbook contributed to a new front in global rivalry – the information/cyber domain – becoming openly acknowledged. 

**Resurgence of “Neo-Fascist” Thought in Russia:** Dugin’s prominence (he often appeared on state TV in the 2000s as a pundit, and had positions like head of Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow State University until 2014) signaled a wider trend of far-right nationalist ideas gaining legitimacy. This is historically significant because in the 1990s, liberal ideas were more influential; by the 2010s, nationalism and Eurasianism were mainstream in Russian politics. As historian Timothy Snyder put it, Dugin is forwarding ideologies of Eurasianism and National Bolshevism within the mainstream ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=to%20the%20worrisome%20rise%20of,17)). The danger, as some point out, is that this is a return to thinking reminiscent of the 1930s – great-power chauvinism, militarism, and contempt for international law ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=in%20his%20book%2C%20,in)). John Dunlop explicitly compared Dugin’s vision to the “lurid imperial fantasies” of fascist demagogues like Hitler and Mussolini, warning that it represents a possible reversion to destructive past ideologies ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). The implication here is that Russian foreign policy, to the extent it follows Dugin’s line, could contribute to global instability similar to the interwar period. Indeed, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was the first forcible change of European borders since WWII, which many saw as a very alarming precedent – Snyder noted it was as if 21st-century Russia adopted a 1930s-like expansionism rationalized by Dugin’s worldview ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20Eurasian%20ideology%20draws%20an,moving%20force%20of%20a%20rather)). This has fed talk of a “New Cold War” or even a “Hybrid World War” in pieces (like Ukraine, Syria). 

**Global Geopolitics and Counter-Reactions:** Dugin’s prescription to ally with anti-Western states has materialized in a loose alignment often termed the “Axis of Authoritarians” – Russia, China (despite Dugin’s misgivings, necessity drove them together), Iran, and some smaller states. This axis, while not a formal alliance, cooperates at the UN to counter Western initiatives, conducts joint military drills, and develops alternatives to Western-led institutions (like BRICS Bank, SCO exercises, etc.). It reflects Dugin’s idea of a multipolar world emerging. However, a real-world implication has been increased polarization and the erosion of global cooperation. Issues like the Syrian civil war turned into proxy battles reminiscent of Cold War, with Russia (and Iran) on one side and Western states on the other – fulfilling Dugin’s call for a Russian-Islamic (Shi’a in this case) alliance challenging Western interests ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)). Another area is Turkey: Dugin wanted to break Turkey; what happened is more complex – Turkey pivoted somewhat independent, buying Russian weapons (which pleases Dugin) but also intervened against Russian allies in Syria and Azerbaijan (which doesn’t). The Turkey-Russia relationship is now a mix of rivalry and partnership, but notably Turkey has been drifting from the U.S. in some ways, which does align to a degree with Dugin’s vision of weakening NATO’s southern flank. If Turkey ever fully realigns or leaves NATO (not currently likely, but it’s a debate), that would be a major implication in line with Dugin’s influence. 

**Effect on Western Policies:** The perceived influence of Dugin and his ilk has affected how Western policymakers approach Russia. Knowing that some in Moscow think in zero-sum, revanchist terms has likely hardened Western resolve to contain or sanction Russia after aggressive moves. For example, after 2014, NATO increased its presence in Eastern Europe to deter further land grabs – a direct reaction to the kind of strategy Dugin advocates. The EU and U.S. also started investing more in counter-propaganda and energy independence (to avoid Russian leverage) – all because Russia followed parts of the Dugin playbook up to a point, prompting balancing. In a sense, Dugin’s blueprint helped spark the very confrontation it describes. But contrary to his hopes, Russia has not easily prevailed; rather, it’s engaged in a costly, protracted struggle (Ukraine war, economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation in some forums). Dugin likely sees this as the inevitable “Great War of Continents” he foretold – but others might see it as proof of the self-fulfilling and self-destructive nature of such bellicose geopolitics. 

**Within Russia – authoritarian shift:** The internal prescriptions of Dugin (e.g., tighter state control, curbing liberal influence) dovetailed with Putin’s consolidation of power in the 2000s. While many factors influenced Putin’s centralization (the chaos of the 90s, the Chechen terror attacks, etc.), Dugin provided intellectual justification to the siloviki (security elite) to view liberal NGOs, independent media, and Western cultural influence as existential threats. This contributed to policies like the foreign agent law, state TV propaganda, and the marginalization of pro-Western political parties. Russia’s democracy eroded and a nationalist consensus was built – in part because voices like Dugin argued that was necessary for survival ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=for%20that%20to%20happen%20it,This)) ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=behalf%20of%20the%20clearly%20defined,analytical%20thinking%2C%20disregard%20for%20the)). Historically, that means Russia by the 2010s was firmly an illiberal state with expansionist tendencies, reversing the more open trajectory of the early 90s. This has set the stage for prolonged conflict with the West reminiscent of the Cold War, albeit ideologically now framed as traditionalism vs global liberalism instead of communism vs capitalism. 

In summary, the historical context of *Foundations of Geopolitics* is the power vacuum and identity crisis of 90s Russia – Dugin provided one radical solution. The real-world implications since have been significant: Russia has indeed pursued many policies that align with Dugin’s recommendations (reasserting control in the near abroad, forming anti-Western partnerships, undermining Western unity, and cracking down internally). Whether directly influenced by him or convergently developing, the outcome is that global geopolitics in the 2020s increasingly resemble the confrontation Dugin envisioned. This has made the world more uncertain: some see in it the seeds of a new Cold War or even World War (if miscalculations occur). On the other hand, it has also galvanized NATO and Western allies to strengthen their unity and defenses, arguably counteracting some of Dugin’s goals. The ultimate implication for global geopolitics is a more divided international system, where blocs led by the U.S., Russia (and possibly China) contest for influence – precisely the multipolar dynamic Dugin called for, though perhaps not exactly on the terms he wanted (with Russia as an equal pole; in reality, Russia sometimes plays a junior role to China or struggles under sanctions). 

In any case, *Foundations of Geopolitics* is historically significant as a roadmap that, for better or worse, anticipated and perhaps encouraged a sharp turn in Russia’s trajectory – from a tentative partner of the West in the 90s to an avowed adversary by the 2010s. Its influence illustrates how intellectual narratives can shape policy in international affairs, especially in times of flux and grievance. As **Foreign Policy** magazine wrote, Dugin’s book is “terrifying” in its implications ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,modern%20occult%20movements%2C%20and%20the)) and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine can be seen as a “continuation of a Dugin-promoted strategy” ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Soviet%20era,also%20used%20the%20symbol%20as)). The world is still grappling with the fallout of that strategy, from war in Europe to cyber disputes to realignments in Asia. 

# Case Studies and Real-World Examples of Similar Strategies  

To gauge the feasibility and consequences of Dugin-like strategies, it’s useful to examine historical and contemporary cases where comparable grand strategies were attempted. These case studies illuminate how elements of Dugin’s playbook have played out in practice:

**1. Nazi Germany’s Geopolitik (1930s–1940s):** The closest historical parallel to Dugin’s approach is perhaps Nazi Germany’s pursuit of continental hegemony, informed by thinkers like Haushofer and Schmitt (whom Dugin admires). Hitler’s strategy in WWII was to smash the Versailles order, unite Germanic & European lands under Berlin, ally (temporarily) with the USSR (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) to divide Eastern Europe, and fight the Anglo powers for global dominance. Initially, some success: the axis with the USSR partitioned Poland (1939), much of Europe was either conquered or allied by 1940, and Britain stood isolated. However, the strategy collapsed when Hitler overreached by invading the Soviet Union (1941) and declaring war on the U.S. (after Pearl Harbor, 1941). The outcome was catastrophic for Germany – total defeat. **Lessons:** Even if a continental power rapidly gains ground (like Germany did or as Dugin proposes for Russia), a coalition of adversaries (UK, USA, USSR in WWII) can eventually mobilize greater resources to reverse the expansion. This case underscores the dangers of multi-front war and underestimating opponents’ industrial capacity and will – a cautionary tale for any Dugin-style plan. As Dunlop and Snyder note, Dugin’s visions resemble those fascist fantasies ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)); the fate of Nazi Germany is a stark warning of how such confrontations can end. The nuclear age amplifies that warning – all-out war could be even more ruinous now.  

**2. The Cold War Soviet Strategy (1945–1991):** The Soviet Union, especially under Stalin and later Brezhnev, did practice a form of Eurasian land-power strategy against the maritime West. After WWII, the USSR created a bloc in Eastern Europe (Warsaw Pact) – essentially a “buffer zone” like Dugin prescribes for Russia’s west ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). The USSR tried to foster pro-Soviet regimes worldwide (Cuba, parts of the Middle East, Africa, Asia) and support communist movements in Western countries (this mirrors Dugin’s idea of supporting dissidents/extremists in the West, though in that era it was communist parties, peace movements, etc.). How did it play out? The Soviet sphere peaked mid-20th century (they reached parity in nukes, space, had allies in every continent). But internal weaknesses – economic stagnation, nationalist strains in its empire, and an ideological softening – led to its collapse. Notably, the attempt to keep up in the arms race with the economically superior West drained the USSR. **Case analysis:** The Soviet Union’s experience shows a partial validation and partial failure of land-power strategy. They did achieve superpower status and multipolarity for decades, but they couldn’t sustain the competition with the more dynamic West. Importantly, their heavy-handed control of Eastern Europe provoked uprisings (Hungary 1956, Prague 1968, Poland Solidarity in the 80s) – indicating the limits of ruling others by force long-term. When Gorbachev chose not to continue the confrontation (withdrew from Afghanistan, let Eastern Europe go), the Soviet empire unraveled quickly. Dugin essentially wants to restart a Cold War-like scenario but hopes for a different outcome (a sustained Eurasian victory). The case suggests that unless Russia radically improves its governance and economy (the USSR’s Achilles heel), it might repeat the Soviet trajectory of imperial overstretch and collapse. 

**3. Putin’s Russia (2000–Present):** We should consider modern Russia as a live case. Under Putin, many elements akin to Dugin’s strategy have been attempted, albeit selectively. **Georgia 2008:** Russia invaded Georgia to prevent NATO expansion there and effectively detached two regions (Abkhazia, South Ossetia) which remain Russian-occupied. This is very much in line with Dugin’s view of breaking the “cordon sanitaire” and punishing pro-NATO neighbors ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=The%20Moscow,tendencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Ireland%2C%20and)). Outcome: Georgia’s NATO hopes were indeed dampened, but Russia faced international condemnation and only a few states recognized the breakaways. It signaled Russia’s willingness to use force, raising its regional clout short-term. However, it also alerted other neighbors. **Ukraine 2014–2023:** As discussed, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incitement of rebellion in Donbas followed Dugin’s prescription to take eastern Ukraine ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=West,geographic%20uniqueness%2C%20no%20ethnic%20exclusiveness)). Short-term, Russia gained territory and undermined Ukraine’s sovereignty. But long-term outcomes (so far): Ukraine turned sharply Westward, signed an association with EU, strengthened its military with Western help, and in 2022 Russia’s full invasion has met fierce resistance. NATO, which Dugin wanted to break, instead looks revitalized (Finnish and Swedish accession). This case reveals that such aggression can boomerang. While Russia holds Crimea and some parts of Donbas, it faces a quagmire conflict and an emboldened, united Western front. Economically, sanctions have cut Russia off from technology and markets, potentially weakening it in the long run. This is a concrete example of the *costs of Dugin’s approach*. Even if Russia eventually forces a settlement in Ukraine, it will be a pyrrhic victory given damage suffered. **Syrian Civil War:** Russia intervened decisively in 2015 to prop up Assad, aligning with Iran – exactly as Dugin proposed forging a Russian-Iranian axis in the Middle East ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the)). Outcome: Assad’s regime survived, Russia got a lasting footprint (bases) in Syria, and Moscow gained leverage in the region as a power broker. This is one case where a Dugin-like alliance (with Iran and also tacitly with Turkey/Israel at times) achieved its aims relatively successfully, at least so far. It showed that Russia can project power beyond its immediate neighborhood when U.S. focus wavers. The cost was some financial and reputational damage (bombing campaigns, civilian toll) but Russia proved its point that it can uphold an ally and challenge Western influence. Syria thus stands as a “win” for the Eurasian side in that locale, consistent with Dugin’s anti-Atlanticist coalition idea. However, Syria is also destroyed and impoverished now – being the patron of such ruin yields limited rewards beyond strategic positioning. 

**4. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (2013–Present):** An interesting parallel is China’s strategy in Eurasia via the Belt and Road (BRI). While not directly derived from Dugin, BRI’s concept of building infrastructure and influence across Eurasia to create a “World Island” connectivity resonates with Mackinder’s world and is a non-military analog to some of Dugin’s goals (i.e., diminish Western maritime advantage by developing overland trade networks). China’s approach is more economic and diplomatic rather than openly confrontational. Outcome: China has gained significant influence in Central Asia (even traditionally Russian-influenced), Pakistan, and parts of Eastern Europe and Africa through investment. This could be seen as a case where a *land power (China) challenges the sea powers through economic expansion instead of war*. If Russia had chosen a strategy more akin to China’s – focusing on economy and soft power – it might have gained influence without so much backlash. But Dugin’s method is more force-oriented. Still, China’s rise supports Dugin’s multipolar argument: *the U.S. is no longer uncontested; a Eurasian giant (China) is co-equal economically*. Yet, ironically, China’s success also threatens Russia’s relative standing – a nuance Dugin likely underappreciated. The Sino-Russian dynamic now is somewhat like Dugin’s fear (Russia being overshadowed in Central Asia by China ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Shinzo%20Abe%20and%20Vladimir%20Putin,%28Alexander%20Nemenov%2FAFP)), as seen in Kazakhstan where Chinese investment dwarfs Russia’s). 

**5. Brexit (2016) and EU Divisions:** Dugin specifically wanted the UK out of Europe ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=engagement%20with%20Germany%2C%20and%20absorb,is%20not%20all%20that%20fantastical)). In 2016, Britain voted for Brexit – a case that arguably aligns with Dugin’s objectives. There’s evidence Russian info ops supported pro-Brexit narratives, though how much influence they had is debatable. Regardless, Brexit happened and did cause some EU turmoil. Outcome: In the short term, the EU lost a major military power and had internal disputes. This could be seen as a strategic win for Russia’s divide-and-rule – EU unity was shaken, and the UK turned inward to handle Brexit. However, long term, the EU adapted and has remained together on key issues like sanctions on Russia. The UK has actually become even more hawkish on Russia (Johnson’s government was very forward in aiding Ukraine). So while Brexit removed an Atlanticist voice from EU councils (which Dugin wanted), it also freed the UK to pursue a more independent (and in recent cases, robustly anti-Russian) foreign policy. It’s a mixed bag case: a Dugin-like destabilization occurred, but it didn’t clearly advantage Russia in security terms. Still, Brexit is often cited (including by Dugin’s followers) as evidence that Western structures can fracture – feeding the belief in the vulnerability of Atlantic unity. 

**6. Yugoslav Wars (1990s):** We touched on this in analysis: Yugoslavia’s disintegration and Western intervention in the 90s was a real-world test of Atlantic vs Eurasian influence in Europe’s periphery. Russia (weak in the 90s) couldn’t stop NATO’s actions (like the 1999 bombing of Serbia). Dugin points to this as a case of Western unchecked power and the need for Eurasian strength. Conversely, one might see it as a case where a regional hegemon (Serbia) trying to dominate others (in a mini version of Dugin’s approach) ended up isolated and defeated by a Western coalition. The Bosnia and Kosovo interventions, though controversial, were successes for NATO’s strategic goals. This arguably set a precedent that later alarmed Russia (contributing to its resolve to prevent a repeat in places like Syria or its own Caucasus). For case study, Yugoslavia shows how regional dominance strategies can provoke international responses if they’re seen as violating humanitarian norms (Serbia’s actions against Bosniaks/Albanians spurred Western moral justification for intervention). Dugin’s strategy could likewise provoke interventions, except Russia’s nuclear status complicates that. But instead of humanitarian, the justification becomes upholding international law (as in sanctioning Russia for Ukraine invasion). The West couldn’t militarily intervene in Ukraine due to nuclear risk, but they intervened economically and via arms supply to Ukrainians. 

**7. “Finlandization” of Finland vs. NATO Expansion:** Dugin’s goal of Finlandization for all Europe ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20declares%20that%20,enemy%3A%20the%20rejection%20of%20Atlanticism)) ironically collided with the actual case of Finland. During the Cold War, Finland was “Finlandized” (neutral, careful not to offend USSR). After 1991, Finland gradually leaned West but stayed militarily nonaligned – a status quo that might have pleased Dugin if continued. However, as Russia grew more aggressive (2014 and 2022), Finland decisively ended its neutrality and joined NATO in 2023, along with Sweden – precisely opposite to Dugin’s prescription. This case illustrates how aggressive strategy can backfire strategically. By acting as a threat, Russia pushed previously neutral states into the rival camp. It’s a classic security dilemma outcome: measures taken ostensibly for security (like attacking Ukraine to keep NATO away) resulted in *more* NATO presence (now on a much longer Finland-Russia border). The outcome of Finlandization attempt: failure in this instance. If Dugin’s plan was to push NATO out of the Baltics, the opposite occurred – NATO enlarged further. This could be a case frequently cited in Western analyses challenging the efficacy of Dugin’s approach. It suggests that in some contexts, countries would rather band together for protection than appease a threatening power. 

**8. Support for Separatism in Multi-ethnic States:** Russia’s use of separatism as a tool has precedents: Transnistria in Moldova (1992) – Russia backed a breakaway region to keep leverage in Moldova. It succeeded in freezing Moldova’s westward movement for a long time. Also, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Russia unofficially armed both sides at times to keep influence. These smaller cases show Russia employing “divide and influence” tactics effectively on a small scale. Outcomes: frozen conflicts that give Russia a foot in the door diplomatically (e.g., Russian peacekeepers in Transnistria, influence over any Karabakh settlement as co-chair of Minsk Group). They do however impede development and stability in those regions, arguably keeping them weak (which is part of Russia’s goal: no strong neighbors unless allied). The cost to Russia was minimal and the benefit was strategic stalemate favorable to Russian presence. This indicates that piecewise, Dugin’s approach of creating *“controlled chaos”* around Russia’s periphery can achieve tactical gains (buffer zones, pressure points). But scaling that up (to major states or globally) has larger consequences. 

**9. The “Gerasimov Doctrine” (as perceived):** Around 2013, a Russian general, Valery Gerasimov, wrote about hybrid warfare blending military and non-military means – Western analysts dubbed this the “Gerasimov Doctrine”, interpreting it as a playbook for the kind of multi-dimensional conflict Dugin advocates (combining propaganda, cyber, proxies, conventional force). Case: Ukraine 2014 was seen as an application, where Russia used info ops, special forces without insignia (“little green men”), local militias, and conventional deterrence all at once. It yielded Crimea with hardly a shot, and destabilized Donbas. That hybrid model was initially hailed as a new Russian way of war. However, in 2022 Russia shifted to a more conventional heavy invasion and met much stiffer resistance, suggesting the hybrid approach might only work under certain conditions (local pro-Russia sentiment, element of surprise, opponent weakness). The “Gerasimov” strategy (which really is just modernized Soviet active measures + limited war) seems to align with Dugin’s holistic view of conflict. The case shows it can be potent in limited scenarios (Crimea), but may not achieve larger strategic victories (it didn’t fully subdue Ukraine, only froze conflict at a certain level). 

**10. Historical “Continental Alliances” Against Sea Powers:** In modern times, there hasn’t been a formal “Moscow-Berlin-Tokyo” axis as Dugin dreamed (closest was WWII’s failed Axis). But there have been partial alignments: **France-Germany-Russia** tried a form of alignment by jointly opposing the US-led Iraq War in 2003. That was a fleeting coalition of interest, not a bloc, but it did show that major Eurasian powers could coordinate diplomatically against an Anglo-American initiative – and they succeeded in preventing UN approval for the war, though the US went in anyway. The consequence of that was limited, but it indicated that if provoked by what they saw as American overreach, some Western states will break ranks (which Dugin hopes to exploit systematically). Another example: **SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Org)** – includes China, Russia, and Central Asians (and now India, Pakistan). It’s not an alliance, but a forum that stands somewhat apart from Western institutions. It has served to increase security cooperation and present a united front vs. “Western interference” in members’ internal affairs (e.g., collective stance against “color revolutions”). This corresponds to Dugin’s call for a continental coalition. The SCO’s efficacy is modest – it hasn’t confronted the West directly, but it has solidified ties among those regimes. It’s a case of soft balancing rather than hard balancing. Real-world result: a slow drift toward bifurcation of international norms (with SCO states emphasizing sovereignty and non-interference, counter to Western liberal interventionist ideas). 

**11. United States’ “Divide and Rule” tactics:** As a counter-case, the US and UK historically employed strategies somewhat inverse to Dugin’s. For example, during the Cold War, the US used *support for insurgencies* (Afghanistan mujahideen, Eastern Bloc dissidents) to weaken the Soviet bloc – akin to Dugin’s recommendation of supporting dissidents in the West ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)). These met with varying success: Afghanistan mujahideen did bleed the USSR (leading to withdrawal in 1989), and support for Poland’s Solidarity and other movements helped undermine Soviet control in Eastern Europe. So, one could argue the West successfully applied similar subversive tactics to a rival empire, contributing to its collapse. Dugin essentially proposes Russia mirror those tactics back. The risk is the US and West are more resilient due to their democratic systems – dissent doesn’t cause collapse as easily as in a repressive system, one could argue. Another Western tactic: *NATO expansion itself* was a divide strategy – pulling Eastern Europe away from Russian orbit. It succeeded without war because those nations willingly joined. This is a case where *soft power and institutional attraction* achieved what Dugin tries to achieve through coercion. The outcome strengthened the Western bloc. It illustrates a powerful counterpoint: if Russia had attractiveness (economic prosperity, rule of law), its neighbors might ally out of desire rather than fear. Dugin’s route bypasses that and goes straight to coercion, which tends to engender resistance. 

**12. Empire and Multipolar Era Comparison:** Looking further back, one might compare to the “Great Game” of the 19th century – Tsarist Russia vs. British Empire in Central Asia. Russia then was expanding south (Caucasus, Turkestan) and Britain moved into Afghanistan to block it. Dugin essentially wants to resume a Great Game-like posture. Historically, the Great Game ended more in stalemate than decisive victory; both empires overextended somewhat and eventually found a modus vivendi (Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 dividing spheres). A similar outcome could happen: Russia and the West might eventually agree to some new spheres (perhaps informally acknowledging Ukraine in Western sphere but Belarus in Russian, etc.). Dugin wouldn’t love compromise, but real outcomes might be compromises if outright victory proves elusive for either side. 

**13. Non-Russian Applications of Dugin’s Ideas:** Interestingly, some far-right movements in Europe and America have been influenced by Dugin. For instance, certain alt-right or European New Right figures laud Dugin’s stance against liberalism. Steve Bannon once expressed interest in Traditionalist thinkers (like Evola, whom Dugin also admires) ([Putin’s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin’s Foundations of Geopolitics](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=Atlanticists%2C%20Dugin%20claims%2C%20are%20the,stratagems%20have%20come%20to%20fruition)). While not a direct strategy, this ideological cross-pollination is a case of how Dugin’s ideas spread globally. The outcome is a curious one: Western far-right populists sometimes echo pro-Russian talking points (e.g., criticizing NATO, EU, praising Putin as a champion of traditional values). This “infowar” case shows a partial success of Dugin’s approach to undermining Western unity from within – it has at least created a fifth column of sympathizers (though they are still relatively fringe or intermittent in power, except in places like Hungary under Orban). Should such forces gain more power in major Western states, it would be a realization of Dugin’s scenario of the West fracturing from within. The election of Trump, who was openly skeptical of NATO, was seen by some (including Russians) as an example of the U.S. moving toward isolationism ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=neoliberal%20%20globalist%20Western%20hegemony%2C,407%20isolationist%20tendencies%20in%20American)) ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=internal%20American%20activity%2C%20encouraging%20all,9)). During Trump’s term, U.S.-Europe relations were strained (e.g., over NATO spending), aligning with Dugin’s goals somewhat. However, U.S. institutions and alliances endured, and post-2020 the U.S. reaffirmed commitments. Still, that period is studied as proof that Western alliance can weaken if certain politics prevail – a condition Dugin’s strategy tries to accelerate. 

In summary, the case studies illustrate: **(a)** Strategies similar to Dugin’s (expansionist, alliance-building, subversion) have historically led to major wars or cold wars with mixed outcomes – sometimes temporary success, often eventual pushback or collapse. **(b)** Modern attempts by Russia to apply parts of his strategy have achieved tactical victories (Crimea, Syria) but also strategic setbacks (strengthening of NATO, costly quagmires). **(c)** Peaceful or soft-power alternatives (like China’s economic outreach or the EU/NATO enlargement by consent) have arguably been more durable in expanding influence than purely coercive methods – suggesting a weakness in Dugin’s neglect of economics and soft power. **(d)** The ideological component of Dugin’s strategy – forming a transnational traditionalist alliance – has seen limited but notable uptake among fringe groups globally, which is unprecedented in some ways (e.g., American and European right-wingers looking to Moscow for leadership, reversing Cold War ideological lines). If that expands, it could reshape internal politics in Western countries, fulfilling some of Dugin’s hopes by turning parts of the West against itself.

Each case underscores that the outcomes of grand strategies often diverge from initial plans. Unintended consequences and the adversary’s reactions are crucial. The overall evidence from these examples tends to validate many of the criticisms raised in our logical evaluation: overreach leads to counter-coalitions; coercion breeds resistance; ideology can rally support but also blind leaders to pragmatic adjustments. 

Nevertheless, these cases also show that revisionist powers can achieve significant changes (USSR once carved half of Europe, China is shifting balances now, etc.), so one cannot dismiss Dugin’s strategy as impossible. It is high-risk, and history suggests it often ends in either defeat or at best Pyrrhic victory. The challenge is that nuclear weapons raise the stakes to existential levels; thus, case studies from the pre-nuclear era have to be applied cautiously to now. It implies that if pursued fully, a Dugin-style push could risk unprecedented devastation (a “World War III” scenario) – which is perhaps why even Putin, though aggressive, has not gone all-out to Dugin’s endpoints (e.g., he hasn’t tried to invade the Baltic States or directly attack Western Europe, knowing that would trigger NATO fully). 

In essence, real-world examples show bits of Dugin’s world coming to life, but they also validate the counter-arguments about its dangers and difficulties. It’s a strategy that can shake the status quo – and indeed we live in more tense, divided times partly because of such efforts – but whether it can ultimately prevail is highly doubtful given historical patterns and current global power distributions.  

# Academic and Analytical Critiques of Dugin’s Positions  

Dugin’s ideas have been the subject of extensive commentary and critique in academic and policy circles. Many scholars find his ideology alarming, labeling it neo-fascist, while a few see elements of truth in his geopolitical analysis. Here we summarize and reference some key critiques and perspectives:

**John B. Dunlop (Hoover Institution):** Dunlop’s 2004 analysis of *Foundations of Geopolitics* was one of the first in-depth Western examinations. He concluded that the book’s influence on Russian elites *“testifies to the worrisome rise of neo-fascist ideas”* in late Yeltsin and Putin-era Russia ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Hoover%20Institution%20%20senior%20fellow,17)). He points out the parallels between Dugin’s ultra-nationalism and interwar fascism – especially the ambition for continental empire and the disdain for post-WWII norms ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). Dunlop calls Dugin a “dangerous Russian fascist” who has gained advisory roles and networked with the security services ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20a%20moment%20of%20exultant,a%20tendency)). One of his key critiques is that Dugin’s system is a repackaging of the “discourse of war” ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=presidential%20administration%2C%20the%20secret%20services%2C,50)) – he cites Russian academic Andrei Tsygankov’s warning that Eurasianists like Dugin essentially preach perpetual conflict. Dunlop also underscores how Dugin explicitly rejects the entire architecture built after WWII (the United Nations system, Helsinki principles, etc.) ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). He implies that adopting Dugin’s ideas would mean a return to a might-makes-right world, with Russia acting like the fascist powers of old – a prospect he finds terrifying. Dunlop’s work is well-sourced and one of the footnotes sources (footnote [9]) for Wikipedia’s summary of Dugin’s book ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=9.%20,George%20Washington)). His critique supports the view that Dugin’s blueprint is extremist and norm-violating. 

**Timothy Snyder (Historian, Yale University):** Snyder has written about Dugin in the context of Russian authoritarianism and the war in Ukraine. He notes that *Foundations of Geopolitics* is heavily influenced by Carl Schmitt, “the leading Nazi political theorist,” and that Dugin explicitly calls to draw on fascism and Stalinism for a new Eurasian ideology ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20Eurasian%20ideology%20draws%20an,moving%20force%20of%20a%20rather)). Snyder sees Dugin as advocating a kind of “National Bolshevism” – mixing far-right and far-left totalitarian ideas – to rally Russia. He specifically highlights Dugin’s long-standing support for the “division and colonization of Ukraine” ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=number%20of%20people%20in%20the,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)), linking Dugin’s ideology to the current conflict. Snyder’s critique is that Dugin provides a pseudo-intellectual cover for what is essentially a fascist vision: a world divided into empires that crush smaller nations (like Ukraine). Snyder writes that Eurasianism is not just an abstract idea but “the creed of a number of people in the Putin administration” ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=century%20to%20draw%20what%20is,division%20and%20colonization%20of%20Ukraine)), suggesting Dugin’s influence is tangible. Snyder’s own moral stance is clear – he calls out the hypocrisy of the Kremlin accusing others of fascism while following fascist logic themselves ([Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine | Timothy Snyder | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/03/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/#:~:text=of%20TV%20and%20the%20Internet)). In *The Road to Unfreedom* (2018), Snyder elaborates that Dugin’s ideology of chaos (with symbols like the chaos star on his book cover ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,references%2C%20numerology%2C%20traditionalism%20and%20other))) and the embrace of lies or “post-truth” align with a broader authoritarian trend. Snyder essentially warns that Dugin’s ideas contribute to a world of “eternal conflict” which Putin’s regime seems to be pushing. 

**Anton Shekhovtsov (political scientist):** Shekhovtsov specializes in the European far-right and its connections to Russia. In a 2008 article, he described *the “palingenetic thrust” (rebirth narrative) in Dugin’s neo-Eurasianism* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=19.%20%5E%20Shekhovtsov%2C%20Anton%20%282008,1080%2F14690760802436142)). He argues Dugin’s worldview is about a spiritual rebirth of a civilization through conflict – a classic fascist trope (palingenesis is a core element of fascism per scholar Roger Griffin). Shekhovtsov details Dugin’s use of esoteric and traditionalist motifs and how he instrumentalizes them for a fascist-style politics. His critique focuses on Dugin’s *mythic and occult aspects* as well, pointing out that Dugin, despite toning down occult references in this book ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,references%2C%20numerology%2C%20traditionalism%20and%20other)), elsewhere indulges in them (like referencing Hyperborean Aryan theories, etc.). Shekhovtsov essentially labels Dugin’s movement a *totalitarian cult of national rebirth*, incompatible with democratic values. This supports the view that Dugin’s ideology is not a normal realpolitik strategy but an ideological mission that justifies extreme measures. 

**Marlène Laruelle (scholar on Eurasianism):** Laruelle has extensively studied Dugin and related movements. In *Russian Eurasianism: An Ideology of Empire* (2008), she situates Dugin as the most prominent neo-Eurasianist, but she also notes he is one of several strands (others being more academic or moderate). Laruelle often points out that while Dugin’s rhetoric is grand, the actual Russian foreign policy is more pragmatic. She argues that *the Kremlin uses Eurasianist concepts instrumentally* without fully subscribing to Dugin’s radical philosophy. In one article, she suggested Dugin serves as a “useful idiot” or fringe figure whose presence makes Putin’s actual nationalism seem moderate by comparison. Laruelle’s critique is less moralistic and more analytical: she dissects how Dugin draws from earlier Eurasianism, and she contends that Dugin’s novelty is tying geopolitics to far-right metapolitics. She might challenge the coherence of Dugin’s strategy by noting that Eurasianism historically had multiple, sometimes contradictory, interpretations. Also, Laruelle underlines that Dugin’s influence can be overstated – he is loud, but policy is made by Putin’s inner circle, who are not ideologues like Dugin but “pragmatic conservatives.” This critique implies that while Dugin provides a blueprint, Russia’s actions are driven also by power calculus and not purely by Dugin’s playbook. (That said, the overlap remains striking, as others note). Laruelle also highlights internal dissent: not all Russian nationalists agree with Dugin (some are ethnic nationalists who dislike his imperial Eurasian bent that includes Muslims; others are communists who hate his fascist streak). So Dugin’s position even in Russian nationalist discourse is contested. This counters any idea that he’s a unanimous voice for Russian strategy – he represents one coalition of thought (National Bolsheviks, etc.). 

**Western Military and Policy Analysts:** The U.S. Army War College, RAND Corporation, and various think tanks have examined Dugin’s influence. For example, a piece in *Foreign Affairs* titled “Putin’s Brain?” discussed Dugin, concluding that Putin is not a puppet of Dugin but finds some of his ideas useful. They cautioned not to exaggerate his direct role, but acknowledged that Dugin’s framing of an existential struggle with the West resonates with Putin’s worldview. Many analysts support the idea that Dugin’s *Foundations* was a “trial balloon” for a new Russian grand strategy that we have seen partially implemented. Some, like Mark Galeotti, argue that the Russian military’s interest in geopolitics and Eurasianist thought increased under late Gen. Nikolai Klokotov (who was credited by Dugin as co-author, though Klokotov denies formal co-authorship ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Dugin%20credits%20General%20Nikolai%20Klokotov,8))). This indicates some military intellectuals found Dugin’s work appealing. However, Galeotti also suggests Russian actions are guided by opportunism and security concerns more than mystical destiny – so there’s a balance between Dugin’s ideological fervor and the actual policy rationales. 

**Critiques from within Russia:** There are liberal Russian scholars (like Dmitry Travin or Yulia Latynina) who have criticized Eurasianism as dangerous pseudo-science that could lead Russia to isolation and ruin. They argue that Dugin’s anti-West obsession blinds Russia to the benefits of cooperation and modernization. For instance, a Russian economist might point out that Dugin’s autarkic “Third Way economics” ([](https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Economic%20aspects%20of%20the%20New,271)) is a recipe for stagnation – indeed Russia tried import substitution after 2014 and it led to higher costs and limited growth. So, from a policy standpoint, Dugin’s neglect of economics is seen as a weakness. Many Russian liberals view Dugin’s influence as symptomatic of a broader anti-democratic turn. Some have even called for him to be marginalized because his extremist views tarnish Russia’s image and could provoke conflict unnecessarily. 

**The Foreign Policy Review (2014) and others:** An oft-cited quote (which appears on Wikipedia) is Foreign Policy magazine describing *Foundations of Geopolitics* as *“one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books of the post-Soviet era… more sober than Dugin’s prior works, better argued, shorn of occult references”* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20described%20by,modern%20occult%20movements%2C%20and%20the)). This captures the dual nature of the critique: impressed by the intellectual breadth but terrified of the content. FP also noted in 2022 that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows Dugin’s strategy of weakening the liberal order ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Soviet%20era,also%20used%20the%20symbol%20as)), implicitly critiquing that strategy as responsible for war. 

**Counter-arguments Supporting Dugin’s Views:** While mainstream academia largely condemns or at least questions Dugin, there are some voices (particularly in non-Western or anti-establishment circles) that echo parts of his critique of Western hegemony. For example, some Chinese strategists might privately agree with the concept of a U.S. encirclement to be broken (though China obviously wouldn’t want Russia to break China!). Certain far-left anti-imperialists in the West oddly align with Dugin in opposing U.S. unipolarity, though they differ vastly on values. There are also European New Right thinkers (Alain de Benoist, etc.) who appreciate Dugin’s challenge to liberalism – indeed Dugin has engaged in dialogues with them. However, even de Benoist, who is anti-American, is uneasy with Dugin’s authoritarian and imperial bent (de Benoist advocates Europe freed from both USA and Russia). So outright support for Dugin’s *prescriptions* is rare outside fringe circles. But his *diagnosis* that the U.S.-led order imposes certain norms and that many civilizations chafe at this – that finds some resonance in academic discussions of post-colonial international relations. Realist scholars like John Mearsheimer, though having no connection to Dugin, also argue that NATO’s expansion provoked Russia (a point Dugin would agree with, though Mearsheimer certainly doesn’t endorse Dugin’s response). This intersection is interesting: it means even Western scholarship has strands that indirectly validate parts of Russia’s grievance narrative, if not its actions. Dugin capitalizes on these to argue that even Westerners know the U.S. is overreaching. 

**Moral and Legal Critiques:** From a legal perspective, scholars point out that Dugin’s agenda violates international law norms – from sovereignty to human rights. That frames Dugin’s approach as essentially advocating war crimes (like stirring ethnic conflicts intentionally). This legal critique aligns with the moral one: that implementing Dugin’s ideas leads to enormous human suffering (as seen in Ukraine). Ethicists would say Dugin’s end goal (a multipolar order where Russia is safe) does not justify the means he advocates (subversion, annexation, fostering extremism) – labeling those means as unjust and destabilizing globally. 

In summary, the broad consensus among academics and analysts is that Dugin’s *Foundations of Geopolitics* is a dangerous, albeit intellectually elaborate, doctrine. It’s lauded only by those who share a deep anti-liberal, anti-American worldview, and even many of them are cautious about its extremity. Key critiques revolve around labeling it *neo-fascist* ([Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Hoover%20Institution%20%20senior%20fellow,17)), highlighting its contradictions and potential to harm Russia itself, and warning that following it invites conflict reminiscent of the worst periods of the 20th century ([Aleksandr Dugin's Foundations of Geopolitics | FSI](https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/aleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics#:~:text=Aleksandr%20Dugin%27s%20Foundations%20of%20Geopolitics%2C,end%20to%20the%20cold%20war)). While Dugin might retort that the liberal world order is itself harmful to Russia’s identity and interests, critics counter that Dugin’s cure would be worse than the disease, plunging Russia and perhaps the world into isolation, poverty, or war. 

Ultimately, academic critiques serve to contextualize Dugin as part of a long line of radical geopolitical thinkers whose ideas, if taken to their conclusion, often lead to tragedy. They also help outsiders understand that while Dugin’s influence is real, it is one factor among many in Russian policy, and not all Russians or Russian leaders buy into the totality of his vision. The war in Ukraine has certainly given these critiques urgency – as many see it as a test case of Dugin’s philosophy, and its violent fallout as evidence of the philosophy’s moral bankruptcy and practical flaws.
