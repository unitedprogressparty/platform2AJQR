A virus naturally produces "antigens" that are unique to that virus.

The test strip contains antibodies that stick to the COVID antigen. These specific antibodies are chosen by testing many different antibodies to find which two stick best to the COVID antigen.

The two best antibodies are cloned in labs. A colored nanoparticle is attached to one of these antibodies.

In the test strip, the colored antibody attaches to the antigen.

Initially, the color isn't visible because it is evenly mixed throughout the liquid sample.

At the end of the test strip is a second antibody, different from the first. This second antibody is also attached to the COVID antigen but at a different spot from the first antibody. It is permanently attached to the test strip itself.

As the liquid moves through the strip, the antigen with the colored antibody attached meets this second antibody, creating an antibody-antigen "sandwich." These colored sandwiches gather at the spot where we put the second antibody, making the color visible and indicating a positive result.






## How a COVID Rapid Antigen Test Works (Step-by-Step):

### Step 1: Collecting and Applying the Sample

- You collect a fluid sample (usually nasal fluid or saliva).
- This fluid sample is applied onto a specific region on the test device, called the **sample pad**.

### Step 2: Initial Interaction (Formation of Antibody-Nanoparticle Complexes)

- An **antigen** is a molecule or protein (a protein is a long chain of smaller molecules folded into a specific shape) originating from a virus or bacteria that triggers an immune response and can be specifically recognized by antibodies.

- Scientists produce antibodies in laboratories using a method called "batch screening," which means testing many different antibodies simultaneously through trial and error, then selecting the ones that stick best to COVID antigens. After selection, these antibodies are combined with tiny colored particles (**nanoparticles** or **colored beads**) to form antibody-nanoparticle complexes. Within the test device, the fluid immediately interacts with these antibody-nanoparticle complexes.

- If **COVID antigens** (specific viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2) are present, they bind to these antibody-coated nanoparticles, forming complexes:

  **Nanoparticle + Antibody + COVID antigen**.

### Step 3: Migration Along the Test Strip

- The fluid, now containing these **antibody-nanoparticle-antigen complexes**, moves along a porous strip through **capillary action** (liquid spontaneously flowing along narrow spaces).
- Unbound nanoparticles (without COVID antigen) also move freely along the strip.

### Step 4: Immobilization and "Sandwich" Formation at the Test Line

- The test strip contains a **test line** area with antibodies immobilized (firmly attached) to the strip.
- These immobilized antibodies recognize a different part (epitope) of the COVID antigen than the first antibody.
- If COVID antigen is present, a “sandwich” forms:

```
Immobilized antibody (fixed on strip)
            +
       COVID antigen
            +
Antibody attached to colored nanoparticle
```

- This "sandwich" immobilizes the nanoparticles at the test line, causing them to accumulate.

### Step 5: Appearance of Visible Color

- The nanoparticles, which are **already colored**, accumulate visibly at the test line.
- No COVID antigen means no sandwich forms, and thus no visible line appears at this spot.

### Step 6: Formation of Control Line

- Further down the strip is a **control line**, with immobilized antibodies capturing leftover colored nanoparticles regardless of antigen presence.
- This control line confirms that the test worked properly.


### History and Discovery:

- **Early Development (1960s-1980s)**:
  - The foundational principle behind rapid antigen tests, known as **lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA)**, was developed and refined throughout the late 20th century. 
  - The earliest patents and practical developments emerged in the 1960s, with substantial advancement and commercialization occurring in the 1980s. Major contributors included researchers and companies such as Unilever, Becton Dickinson, and later Abbott Laboratories.

- **Rapid Growth and Commercialization (1990s-2000s)**:
  - Lateral flow tests gained significant popularity due to simplicity, affordability, and rapid results. They were widely used for pregnancy tests, infectious diseases, and veterinary medicine.

### COVID-19 Specific Developments:

- **2020 Onwards (COVID-19 Pandemic)**:
  - The COVID pandemic rapidly accelerated lateral flow test innovation. Companies and research institutions across the world, notably Abbott Laboratories (BinaxNOW test), Quidel, Roche, and Innova Medical Group, developed highly specific antibodies capable of recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
  - The World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. CDC, and other global health institutions promoted rapid antigen testing as a key tool to control the pandemic.

- **Key People and Institutions**:
  - Notable individuals include Michael Mina (Harvard Epidemiologist), advocating heavily for rapid testing as a public health measure, and research teams at Oxford University and MIT, who contributed significantly to refining testing accuracy and advocating for widespread implementation.

### Application in Drug Testing:

- **Similar Process for Drug Testing**:
  - Lateral flow testing principles are similarly applied to rapid drug tests. Instead of antibodies detecting viral antigens, the tests utilize antibodies specifically chosen to detect drug molecules or their metabolites (substances produced when the body processes drugs).
  - Drug tests use a nearly identical method of immobilizing antibodies on test strips, binding drug molecules if present in a fluid sample (such as urine or saliva), producing visible lines indicating drug presence.

In short, the lateral flow principle that made rapid COVID tests possible has a broad and extensive history, involves contributions from multiple fields, and continues to be widely applicable in various diagnostic and drug-testing applications. Would you like to expand or include this historical and contextual information on the canvas?

Here's an engaging overview of how antibodies are produced, highlighting important individuals and historical developments:

## Historical Background of Antibody Discovery:

- **Paul Ehrlich (Late 1800s–Early 1900s)**:
  - Credited as the early pioneer of antibody theory. Ehrlich proposed the idea of a "magic bullet"—specific molecules that could bind precisely to pathogens without harming healthy cells.

- **Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1890)**:
  - Demonstrated that antibodies could neutralize toxins (diphtheria), proving antibodies existed as protective immune substances. Behring won the first-ever Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901 for this groundbreaking work.

- **Karl Landsteiner (Early 1900s)**:
  - Defined the specificity of antibodies, especially in blood typing, showing antibodies recognize precise structures on molecules called **antigens**.

## Modern Antibody Production:

- **Georges Köhler and César Milstein (1975)**:
  - Invented the process for producing **monoclonal antibodies** (antibodies from identical immune cells cloned from one unique parent cell), revolutionizing medical research. They received a Nobel Prize for this work in 1984.
  - Monoclonal antibodies allowed scientists to reliably produce large amounts of highly specific antibodies against almost any antigen, including viruses, bacteria, and specific proteins.

- **Greg Winter (1980s–1990s)**:
  - Advanced antibody technology further by developing techniques for engineering and humanizing antibodies, making them safer and more effective for medical use. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018.

## How Antibodies Are Created Today (Simplified):

- **Step 1: Immunization or Exposure**
  - Scientists expose animals or specialized immune cells in laboratories to the target antigen (e.g., COVID proteins).

- **Step 2: Immune Response**
  - The immune system naturally produces many different antibodies, each with slight variations.

- **Step 3: Batch Screening (High-Throughput Screening)**
  - Scientists collect these antibodies and perform rapid "batch screening," testing hundreds or thousands of antibodies simultaneously using trial and error to identify the ones that bind strongly and specifically to the target antigen.

- **Step 4: Monoclonal Antibody Production**
  - Selected antibodies are cloned and mass-produced. These antibodies are then combined with colored nanoparticles to form the complexes used in COVID tests.

## Institutions & Companies Leading COVID Test Development:

- **Abbott Laboratories**, **Roche**, and **Quidel** rapidly adapted existing antibody technologies for COVID antigen tests.
- Academic institutions (e.g., MIT, Harvard, Oxford University) contributed significantly to improving the accuracy, efficiency, and public awareness of rapid testing technologies.
