### Curernt Forigen Policy Towards Iran

## 1. United States Policy

### A. Evolving Approaches and the Return of “Maximum Pressure”  
Since the Obama administration negotiated the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), U.S. policy toward Iran has undergone dramatic changes:

- **Obama Administration (2015 – 2017):** Pursued diplomatic engagement, resulting in the JCPOA. Critics argued that the sanctions relief granted under the deal would enable Iran to bolster its regional activities and infrastructure, although that point remains contested.  
- **Trump Administration (2017 – 2021):** Unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, reimposing extensive economic sanctions in a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at cutting off Iran’s oil revenue and deterring further nuclear enrichment and regional missile developments.  
- **Biden Administration (2021 – 2025):** Kept most sanctions intact but did not label its policy as “maximum pressure.” Some limited diplomatic engagements occurred, including humanitarian carve-outs, prisoner releases, and negotiations over Iranian funds restricted to non-military use.  
- **Trump Administration (Beginning 2025):** With President Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025, officials have signaled a renewed or intensified “maximum pressure” policy. Early indications suggest more aggressive sanctions, stricter export controls, and amplified rhetoric on preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

### B. Tactical Moves and Negotiation Levers  
Even amid the shift back to a “maximum pressure” posture, there have been short-term tactical deals—such as prisoner exchanges and limited asset access (restricted to humanitarian goods)—as a means to keep channels open while exerting economic pressure. Current U.S. messaging emphasizes a demand for a verifiable nuclear agreement, but the new administration’s stance appears harsher than that of the Biden years, with Washington hinting at greater secondary sanctions on third-country entities doing business with Iran and tougher enforcement in the financial and energy sectors.

## 2. European Union Policy

### A. Balancing Sanctions with Diplomacy  
The European Union remains committed to a dual-track approach. It has:

- **Tried to preserve the JCPOA** by promoting limited sanctions relief and using legal tools like the updated 1996 blocking statute to protect EU businesses from U.S. secondary sanctions.  
- **Imposed its own restrictive measures** on Iran in response to concerns about human rights, ballistic missile activities, and transfers of drone and missile technologies (particularly to Russia). Recent measures include targeted asset freezes and travel bans on Iranian officials and companies.

### B. Regional and Human Rights Concerns  
EU policymakers emphasize that their actions reflect not only nuclear-proliferation issues but also concerns over Iran’s human rights record and its support for proxy or allied groups (such as Hezbollah). Some in the European Parliament have called for designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, though EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has stated that any such designation would require a legal determination by an EU member-state court. The EU seeks to balance pressure on Tehran with a willingness to engage diplomatically, hoping to keep negotiations possible for a future comprehensive agreement.

## 3. Israel’s Policy

### A. Strategic Security and Preemptive Measures  
Israel regards Iran as its principal security threat due to Iran’s nuclear program and support for regional groups hostile to Israel. Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have frequently emphasized that:

- A nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable, reserving the possibility of military strikes if intelligence indicates an imminent threat to Israel’s security.  
- Coordination with the United States is vital for effective deterrence and economic pressure.

Israel continues to advocate for the toughest possible sanctions and does not rule out unilateral action if it deems international efforts insufficient to curb Iran’s nuclear and missile activities.

### B. Diplomatic and Military Coordination  
Israel actively shares intelligence with the United States regarding Iranian nuclear and regional activities and supports a hardline approach. This includes encouraging Washington to impose strict sanctions, maintain a credible military threat, and coordinate on potential strikes should Iran move closer to weaponizing its nuclear program.

---

## 4. Other Global and Regional Dynamics

### A. Regional Alliances and Rivalries  
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt generally share the U.S. and Israeli concerns about Iran’s ambitions, backing tough sanctions and diplomatic isolation of Tehran. At the same time, Iran looks to Russia and China for diplomatic, economic, and, in some instances, military support, seeking to offset Western pressure with strategic partnerships that lessen the impact of U.S. and European sanctions.

### B. Global Economic and Security Implications  
Countries aligned with the United States and the EU seek to prevent Iran’s nuclear and missile programs from advancing further. However, the reluctance of Russia and China to fully endorse Western-led sanctions often complicates attempts to present a unified international front. Consequently, many measures remain unilateral or limited to coalitions of like-minded governments.

---

## 5. Challenges and Future Outlook

### A. Economic and Humanitarian Impact  
All major sanctions regimes—whether imposed by the U.S. or the EU—have taken a toll on Iran’s economy. Currency devaluation, shrinking oil exports, and reduced external investment have caused widespread economic hardship. While sanctions are intended to change the regime’s behavior, they have also raised humanitarian concerns regarding access to medicines and other essentials.

### B. The Path Forward  
- **U.S. “Maximum Pressure” Resurgence (2025 Onward):** With President Trump’s re-election, early policy statements suggest even tighter sanctions, tougher enforcement, and an explicit return to a hardline stance demanding comprehensive Iranian compliance on both nuclear and missile issues.  
- **EU’s Dual-Track Engagement:** The EU is expected to continue pressuring Iran on human rights and military activities while maintaining a diplomatic door open for negotiations.  
- **Israel’s Security Imperative:** Israel has reiterated its readiness to act preemptively should Iran move closer to a nuclear weapon capability.  
- **Internal Iranian Dynamics:** Economic stress and periodic demonstrations highlight domestic pressures on Iran’s leadership. How these internal factors influence Tehran’s willingness to negotiate or confront external sanctions remains an open question.

---

## Conclusion

As of February 20, 2025, U.S. foreign policy toward Iran is re-entering a phase of “maximum pressure” under President Trump, with stricter sanctions and demands for a broader, verifiable nuclear agreement. The European Union, for its part, is keeping economic pressure on Iran while seeking potential diplomatic off-ramps. Israel remains focused on preventing a nuclear-armed Iran and continues to coordinate closely with Washington. Meanwhile, regional powers generally align with the U.S. on sanctions, but major global actors such as Russia and China complicate any unified response. The resulting policy mix is a high-stakes, rapidly evolving framework, shaped by shifting political realities in Washington and internal pressures in Tehran.

### Iran’s Modern History and Its Relationship with Islam

Iran’s modern history is inseparable from its complex relationship with Islam. While Islam has long been a defining element of Iranian cultural identity, the particular manner in which it has been institutionalized as state ideology has proven, in many respects, to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, the Islamic Republic claims to offer a moral and just system rooted in divine law; on the other, its implementation has often resulted in repressive governance, economic stagnation, and widespread social alienation. This paper adopts a chronological approach to analyze how religious ideology became central to Iranian statecraft and how its continued influence has undermined the prospects for modernization and democracy. By examining root causes, key turning points, and recent political crackdowns, the study aims to illuminate the mechanisms through which an official interpretation of Islam has contributed to the country’s political and economic decline.

**2. Historical Background: From Pre-Islamic Persia to Early Islamic Influence**

Prior to the advent of Islam, Persia was characterized by a rich tapestry of cultural and political influences—Zoroastrianism being the predominant faith. The Arab conquests of the seventh century introduced Islam, which was gradually absorbed and adapted by the Persian population. Early conversions were often pragmatic, driven by tangible incentives such as tax relief, social integration benefits, and political alliances. Although these formative years laid the groundwork for a deep-rooted Islamic cultural heritage, they also established a tradition in which religious identity could be mobilized to support state power.

This period of transformation established enduring patterns of religious governance, including the centralization of clerical authority and the integration of religious law into state policy, which subsequently influenced the structure and legitimacy of later regimes.


**3. The Rise of Shi’a Islam and the Safavid Transformation**

The Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) was pivotal in crystallizing a specifically Shi’a identity in Iran. By declaring Twelver Shi’ism as the state religion, the Safavids not only unified a fragmented society but also established a model in which religious orthodoxy was closely linked to state legitimacy. While this transformation enhanced social cohesion in some respects, it also introduced a framework that privileged clerical authority over secular expertise. The institutionalization of religious leadership laid the foundations for a political culture in which religious law and dogma would eventually take precedence over pluralistic and modern forms of governance.

Critics, including scholars like Ervand Abrahamian and Abbas Amanat, argue that the Safavid model sowed the seeds for future authoritarianism.


**4. The 1979 Islamic Revolution and the Birth of the Islamic Republic**

The modern phase of Islamic governance in Iran was irrevocably set in motion by the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy was driven in large part by popular discontent with Westernization, economic mismanagement, and political repression. However, the revolution also marked a decisive turn toward religious legitimacy. Under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, a new political order was established, implementing Velayat-e Faqih through mechanisms such as the establishment of the Guardian Council, which vetted candidates for elections, and the consolidation of power in the hands of the Supreme Leader, thereby significantly reducing the influence of secular political institutions.

Critically, while the revolution was initially celebrated as a popular uprising against tyranny, its aftermath witnessed the rapid consolidation of power by religious authorities. The new regime implemented policies that emphasized strict adherence to Islamic law in virtually all spheres of life—political, social, economic, and cultural. This radical transformation was accompanied by the suppression of dissent and the marginalization of secular voices. Many scholars argue that the 1979 revolution not only overturned an autocratic monarchy but also replaced one form of authoritarianism with another—this time, underpinned by religious dogma.


**5. Institutionalization of Religious Authority: Velayat-e Faqih and Beyond**

At the heart of the Islamic Republic’s political system is the doctrine of Velayat-e Faqih, which vests supreme power in a single religious jurist. This institutional arrangement, while claiming to ensure that governance remains in line with divine law, has also led to an alarming concentration of power. The principle has effectively marginalized democratic mechanisms and secular institutions, allowing religious ideology to dictate public policy without accountability or contestation.

The impact of this system on Iran’s governance has been profound. Not only has it curbed political pluralism, but it has also provided a convenient ideological framework for justifying repressive policies. For example, decisions on economic management, social policy, and even foreign affairs are frequently framed as religious imperatives rather than rational policy choices. This conflation of religious morality with state governance has resulted in a rigidity that has stymied reform and adaptation in a rapidly changing world.


**6. Socio-Economic Impacts of Religious Governance**

The deliberate intertwining of religious doctrine with state policy has been evident in policies such as the allocation of public contracts based on clerical endorsements and the promotion of loyalty over competence in governmental appointments, contributing to bureaucratic inefficiencies and pervasive corruption.

The systematic marginalization of secular institutions—such as public universities, independent media outlets, and non-religious cultural organizations—has curtailed intellectual debate, led to a conservative reshaping of university curricula, and imposed restrictions on independent media, all of which have hindered technological and economic progress.


**7. Political Repression and the Suppression of Dissent**

One of the most controversial aspects of religious governance in Iran is its systematic suppression of dissent. From the immediate aftermath of the 1979 revolution to the present day, the regime has repeatedly employed repressive measures to silence political opposition and control civil society. Political dissidents, journalists, and activists have faced arbitrary arrests, prolonged detentions, and, in many cases, extrajudicial punishments.

The legal framework that underpins this repression is itself derived from a strict interpretation of Islamic law, which leaves little room for dissent or alternative viewpoints. The blending of religious authority with state power has enabled the regime to label critics as heretics or enemies of the faith—a tactic that not only delegitimizes opposition but also justifies increasingly harsh measures. Over time, this has contributed to an atmosphere where public protest is met with brutal force, and freedom of expression is severely curtailed.

Reports from human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have documented widespread arrests, instances of live ammunition being used against protesters—particularly following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022—and the imposition of extensive internet blackouts during periods of civil unrest.


**8. Recent Developments and Crackdowns**

In recent years, the Iranian regime’s reliance on religious authority has taken on renewed significance in the face of growing domestic and international challenges. The protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, for example, highlighted the deep-seated discontent with the regime’s repressive policies and its rigid moral codes. What began as demonstrations demanding basic human rights rapidly evolved into a broader critique of theocratic rule. The government’s response—a series of swift and severe crackdowns—has underscored the regime’s unwillingness to tolerate dissent.

Reports from human rights organizations detail widespread arrests, the use of live ammunition against protesters, and the imposition of extensive internet blackouts to stifle mobilization. These recent developments are not isolated incidents; rather, they form part of a long continuum of state repression rooted in the fundamental ideology of the Islamic Republic. Critics argue that the reliance on religious dogma has left the regime ill-equipped to respond to the demands of a modern, pluralistic society, thereby exacerbating social unrest and further isolating Iran on the international stage.


**9. Discussion: Root Causes, Actions, and Harms**

A chronological analysis of Islam’s influence in Iran reveals a series of interconnected factors that have collectively contributed to what many describe as the “ruin” of the country. The roots of this process can be traced back to the early institutionalization of a state-sponsored version of Islam—a process that accelerated during the Safavid era and culminated in the radical transformation brought about by the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The subsequent establishment of an institutional framework based on Velayat-e Faqih has proven to be a double-edged sword. While it has provided a unifying ideological narrative, it has also entrenched authoritarian practices and inhibited democratic development.

Key actions that illustrate this trajectory include:
- The deliberate intertwining of religious doctrine with state policy, which has subverted meritocratic governance and led to pervasive corruption.
- The systematic marginalization of secular institutions, thereby curtailing intellectual debate and hindering technological and economic progress.
- The recurrent use of state power to suppress dissent, which has not only violated human rights but also stifled the potential for genuine political reform.

The harms resulting from these actions are manifold. Economically, policies rooted in religious dogma have led to inefficiencies and stunted growth, contributing to chronic poverty and unemployment. Socially, the imposition of strict moral codes has repressed individual freedoms and curtailed the development of a vibrant civil society. Politically, the conflation of religious authority with governance has fostered an environment of fear and repression, alienating large segments of the population and prompting cycles of protest and violent crackdowns.

This discussion illustrates that while Islam as a faith may offer rich spiritual and cultural traditions, its particular institutionalized form—as manifested in the modern Iranian state—has played a decisive role in creating conditions that have undermined national progress. The critique here is not of Islam per se but of the rigid, exclusionary, and often brutal application of its doctrines in governance, which has repeatedly proven to be at odds with the demands of a modern, dynamic society.


**10. Conclusion**

In tracing the historical evolution of Islamic influence in Iran, this paper has argued that the institutionalization of a state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam has had deeply detrimental effects on the country’s political, economic, and social fabric. From its early adoption and transformation during the Safavid era through the radical restructuring of the 1979 revolution to the modern-day crackdowns on dissent, religious governance in Iran has consistently undermined efforts toward pluralism, modernization, and human rights. The recent violent responses to popular protests serve as a stark reminder of the regime’s reliance on religious dogma as a tool of authoritarian control.

For Iran to move beyond the legacy of its troubled past, it could implement concrete reforms such as revising electoral laws to ensure greater transparency, reforming the role of the Guardian Council to allow broader political participation, and drawing on historical examples from countries like Turkey in the 1930s and Tunisia post-Arab Spring, where secular reforms contributed to greater human rights protection and economic revitalization.


### The Twilight War

The United States and Iran have been engaged in a covert conflict for over three decades, characterized by mutual distrust and clandestine operations. This "twilight war" began with the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which transformed Iran from a U.S. ally into an adversary. The subsequent hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran solidified hostilities between the two nations. Throughout the 1980s, the U.S. supported Iraq in its war against Iran, while Iran developed asymmetric warfare tactics and proxy networks. The Iran-Contra affair revealed complex, often contradictory U.S. policies towards Iran. In the Persian Gulf, naval skirmishes and the "Tanker War" brought both nations to the brink of open conflict. Post-9/11, brief cooperation against the Taliban quickly gave way to renewed tensions, especially as Iran expanded its influence in Iraq after the U.S. invasion. The ongoing dispute over Iran's nuclear program and its support for regional proxies continues to fuel this twilight conflict. Despite occasional diplomatic overtures, deep-seated ideological differences and conflicting regional interests have prevented normalization of relations.

### Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy

The Obama administration's approach to Iran marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, prioritizing diplomacy over confrontation. This strategy culminated in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. The negotiation process involved complex multilateral diplomacy, including secret talks facilitated by Oman. The deal aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, representing a departure from previous administrations' policies of isolation and pressure. Critics argued the deal was too lenient, while supporters saw it as a triumph of diplomacy over military options. The agreement faced domestic opposition in both countries, highlighting the challenges of overcoming decades of mutual distrust. The JCPOA's implementation demonstrated the potential for diplomatic solutions to long-standing conflicts, even as regional tensions and ideological differences persisted.

### Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States

The relationships between Israel, Iran, and the United States have been characterized by complex, often covert interactions that defy simplistic narratives. Prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Israel and Iran maintained unofficial but close ties, united by their opposition to Arab nationalism and Soviet influence. The U.S. encouraged this relationship as part of its "periphery doctrine" to contain Soviet expansion. Even after the revolution, pragmatic cooperation continued in various forms, including arms deals during the Iran-Iraq War. The Iran-Contra affair revealed the intricate web of secret negotiations involving all three countries. Israel's stance towards Iran hardened in the 1990s as Tehran increased support for Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups. This shift aligned with U.S. policies of dual containment against Iran and Iraq. However, the 2003 Iraq War disrupted regional power dynamics, leading to renewed concerns about Iran's growing influence. These evolving relationships demonstrate how geopolitical interests can override ideological differences, resulting in unexpected alliances and rivalries.

### A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran

The Obama administration's diplomatic engagement with Iran represented a significant departure from previous U.S. approaches, emphasizing direct negotiations over confrontation. This strategy faced numerous challenges, including domestic opposition in both countries, regional rivalries, and the legacy of mutual distrust. The administration's initial outreach, including Obama's Nowruz message to the Iranian people, aimed to create a new diplomatic opening. However, the 2009 Green Movement protests in Iran and subsequent crackdown complicated these efforts. The discovery of a secret uranium enrichment facility at Fordow further strained relations. Despite these setbacks, the U.S. pursued a dual-track approach of pressure and engagement, combining sanctions with offers of dialogue. The 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president provided a new opportunity for negotiations, leading to the interim Joint Plan of Action. This agreement laid the groundwork for the more comprehensive nuclear deal that followed. Throughout this process, the administration had to navigate complex domestic politics, including congressional skepticism and the concerns of regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia. The diplomatic initiative demonstrated both the potential and limitations of engagement with adversaries, highlighting the challenges of overcoming decades of hostility through negotiation.

### The Iran Threat

Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for regional proxies, and antagonistic stance towards the West pose significant challenges to global security. The country's nuclear program, while claimed to be for peaceful purposes, has raised international concerns about potential weaponization. Iran's uranium enrichment activities, including the use of advanced centrifuges, have steadily increased its capacity to produce fissile material. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) plays a central role in Iran's regional strategy, supporting groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shia militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen. This network of proxies extends Iranian influence and provides deniability for attacks on U.S. interests and allies. Iran's ballistic missile program, one of the largest in the Middle East, complements its asymmetric warfare capabilities and poses a threat to regional stability. The country's cyber warfare capabilities have grown significantly, with attacks targeting critical infrastructure and financial systems in the U.S. and other countries. Iran's revolutionary ideology, which frames the U.S. as an existential enemy, continues to drive its foreign policy and military doctrine. The regime's human rights abuses and suppression of internal dissent further complicate diplomatic engagement efforts. These multifaceted threats require a comprehensive strategy that addresses both Iran's nuclear ambitions and its broader regional activities.

### The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict between Iran and America

The U.S.-Iran relationship is characterized by a complex history of misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and conflicting interests. The 1953 CIA-backed coup against Prime Minister Mossadegh left a lasting legacy of Iranian resentment towards American intervention. The Shah's subsequent rule, while aligned with U.S. interests, created internal tensions that contributed to the 1979 revolution. The hostage crisis that followed fundamentally altered American perceptions of Iran, cementing its image as an adversary. During the Iran-Iraq War, the U.S. tacitly supported Saddam Hussein while simultaneously engaging in covert arms deals with Iran, exemplifying the contradictions in American policy. The 1988 downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by the USS Vincennes further poisoned relations. Post-9/11, brief cooperation against the Taliban gave way to renewed hostility as Iran was labeled part of the "Axis of Evil." The nuclear issue has dominated recent decades, with cycles of negotiations, sanctions, and brinkmanship. Iran's support for groups like Hezbollah and its involvement in conflicts across the Middle East have further complicated diplomatic efforts. Cultural and ideological differences, including Iran's theocratic system and anti-Western rhetoric, create additional barriers to reconciliation. Despite occasional thaws, fundamental disagreements over regional influence, nuclear rights, and the nature of the international order continue to drive the conflict. Resolving this "Persian puzzle" requires addressing deep-seated grievances, acknowledging legitimate security concerns on both sides, and finding areas of mutual interest that can serve as a foundation for improved relations.

### Iran: The Nuclear Challenge

Iran's nuclear program presents a complex challenge to international security and non-proliferation efforts. The program's origins date back to the Shah's era, but it gained renewed focus under the Islamic Republic. Iran claims its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, primarily energy production and medical research. However, the scale of uranium enrichment, secrecy surrounding certain facilities, and development of technologies with potential military applications have raised suspicions about weaponization intent. The international community has responded with a combination of diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and covert actions. UN Security Council resolutions have demanded Iran suspend enrichment activities, while the IAEA has sought greater transparency and access to Iranian nuclear sites. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) temporarily constrained Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief, but its collapse in 2018 led to Iran's gradual resumption of prohibited activities. Technical challenges in monitoring Iran's program, including the potential for undeclared sites and activities, complicate verification efforts. The nuclear issue intersects with broader regional dynamics, including Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal and Saudi Arabia's interest in developing nuclear capabilities. Resolving the Iranian nuclear challenge requires balancing non-proliferation goals with recognition of Iran's right to peaceful nuclear technology, while addressing underlying security concerns that drive its nuclear ambitions.

### Nuclear Iran

Iran's pursuit of nuclear technology has profound implications for regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime. The country has made significant advances in uranium enrichment, operating thousands of centrifuges at facilities like Natanz and Fordow. Iran has also developed indigenous capabilities in nuclear fuel fabrication and heavy water production. While Tehran insists its program is peaceful, the potential for rapid breakout to weapons-grade material remains a concern. Iran's ballistic missile program, capable of delivering nuclear warheads, further complicates the issue. The country has weathered multiple rounds of sanctions and apparent sabotage efforts, including cyberattacks like Stuxnet. Domestic support for the nuclear program, framed as a matter of national pride and technological advancement, creates political obstacles to concessions. Iran's nuclear activities have spurred regional proliferation concerns, with countries like Saudi Arabia expressing interest in matching Iranian capabilities. The technical knowledge gained through the civilian program could potentially be applied to a weapons program, even if current activities remain within declared peaceful bounds. International efforts to constrain Iran's program have included diplomacy, sanctions, and the threat of military action. The JCPOA demonstrated the potential for negotiated solutions, but its collapse highlighted the fragility of such agreements. Resolving the Iranian nuclear issue requires addressing both technical proliferation concerns and the underlying security dynamics that drive Iran's nuclear ambitions.

### The Eagle and the Lion: The Tragedy of American-Iranian Relations

The relationship between the United States and Iran has been marked by missed opportunities, mutual misunderstandings, and conflicting strategic interests. Early 20th century interactions were generally positive, with American advisors like Morgan Shuster supporting Iranian modernization efforts. However, the 1953 CIA-backed coup against Prime Minister Mossadegh created lasting resentment among Iranians, who viewed it as imperialist interference. The subsequent period of close U.S.-Iranian relations under the Shah was characterized by significant economic and military cooperation, but also growing internal opposition to perceived American domination. The 1979 Islamic Revolution fundamentally altered the relationship, with the new regime defining itself in opposition to U.S. influence. The hostage crisis that followed cemented mutual hostility and mistrust. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, attempts at dialogue were undermined by conflicting regional interests, Iran's support for militant groups, and domestic politics in both countries. The nuclear issue has dominated recent decades, with cycles of negotiation and confrontation. Cultural misunderstandings and ideological differences have further complicated efforts at reconciliation. The "tragedy" of U.S.-Iran relations lies in the failure to overcome historical grievances and find common ground, despite periods of potential rapprochement. Resolving this long-standing conflict requires acknowledging past mistakes, addressing legitimate security concerns on both sides, and identifying areas of mutual interest that could serve as a foundation for improved relations.

### Becoming Enemies: U.S-Iran Relations During the Iran-Iraq War, 1979-1988

The Iran-Iraq War period marked a critical juncture in U.S.-Iran relations, transforming the two nations from uneasy partners to entrenched adversaries. In the war's early stages, the U.S. maintained official neutrality while quietly favoring Iraq as a counterweight to revolutionary Iran. This policy shifted towards more overt support for Iraq as the conflict progressed, driven by fears of Iranian victory and its potential impact on regional stability. The U.S. provided Iraq with intelligence, economic aid, and diplomatic support, while simultaneously engaging in covert arms sales to Iran through the Iran-Contra affair. This duplicitous approach undermined trust and reinforced Iranian perceptions of U.S. unreliability. The war saw direct U.S.-Iranian military confrontations in the Persian Gulf, including Operation Praying Mantis and the accidental downing of Iran Air Flight 655. These incidents deepened mutual hostility and set the stage for decades of antagonism. The conflict's aftermath left both countries more deeply entrenched in their adversarial positions, with Iran viewing the U.S. as an existential threat and the U.S. seeing Iran as a destabilizing force in the region. This period solidified the enmity that continues to define U.S.-Iran relations today.

### Iran's Nuclear Programme: Strategic Implications

Iran's nuclear program has far-reaching strategic implications for regional and global security. The program's advancement has altered the balance of power in the Middle East, prompting concerns among Iran's neighbors and Western powers. Israel, perceiving an existential threat, has pursued a strategy of sabotage and assassinations to impede Iran's nuclear progress. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have responded by exploring their own nuclear options, raising the specter of a regional arms race. The program has served as a bargaining chip in Iran's international relations, allowing it to extract concessions in negotiations while demonstrating technological prowess. Domestically, the nuclear issue has become a matter of national pride and sovereignty, complicating efforts at diplomatic resolution. The international community's response, including sanctions and diplomatic isolation, has had significant economic impacts on Iran but has not deterred its nuclear ambitions. The potential for Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability has implications for global non-proliferation efforts, potentially weakening the NPT regime. Military options to prevent Iranian nuclearization carry high risks of regional conflagration. The program's dual-use nature presents ongoing verification challenges, even under international agreements. Ultimately, Iran's nuclear ambitions reflect broader aspirations for regional influence and security against perceived external threats, making a comprehensive resolution difficult without addressing underlying strategic concerns.

### Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the US-Iran Conflict

The enduring conflict between the United States and Iran is deeply rooted in conflicting national narratives and historical mythologies. For Iran, the narrative centers on resistance against foreign domination, drawing on historical experiences of intervention by Russia, Britain, and the United States. The 1953 coup against Mossadegh serves as a powerful symbol of Western imperialism in this narrative. The Islamic Revolution is framed as a triumph of indigenous values over Western cultural and political influence. Conversely, the U.S. narrative has evolved from seeing Iran as a bulwark against communism to viewing it as a rogue state threatening regional stability and American interests. The hostage crisis of 1979-1981 plays a central role in American perceptions, reinforcing images of Iranian hostility and irrationality. These divergent narratives shape policy decisions and public attitudes in both countries, creating self-reinforcing cycles of mistrust and antagonism. Iran's support for groups like Hezbollah and its anti-Israel rhetoric fit into American narratives of Iran as a sponsor of terrorism, while U.S. actions are interpreted through Iranian lenses of resisting imperialism. The nuclear issue has become enmeshed in these competing narratives, with Iran asserting its right to technological advancement and the U.S. framing its opposition in terms of non-proliferation and regional security. These entrenched mythologies create significant obstacles to diplomacy and reconciliation, as policy makers and publics in both countries interpret events through these divergent historical lenses. Overcoming this "clash of narratives" requires acknowledging the power of these national myths while seeking common ground and shared interests that transcend historical grievances.

### Losing Hearts and Minds: American-Iranian Relations and International Education during the Cold War

The history of U.S.-Iran educational exchanges during the Cold War era reveals missed opportunities for cultural understanding. American efforts to use educational programs as soft power tools often clashed with Iranian nationalist sentiments and suspicions of foreign influence. Despite good intentions, these initiatives sometimes reinforced negative perceptions on both sides. The 1953 coup against Mossadegh cast a long shadow over subsequent educational cooperation, with many Iranians viewing such programs as vehicles for American political interference. Nonetheless, these exchanges did produce a generation of Iranians with deep knowledge of the United States, some of whom played important roles in later diplomatic efforts.

### Independence without Freedom: Iran's Foreign Policy

Iran's foreign policy has undergone a significant shift in recent years, moving away from confrontation with regional neighbors towards a more cooperative stance while maintaining hostility towards the U.S. and Israel[2]. This "charm offensive" towards Arab states aims to reduce their reliance on American security guarantees. Iran has proposed a regional forum excluding the U.S. and Israel, gaining some traction among Gulf countries. However, Tehran continues aggressive actions against U.S. interests, including naval harassment in the Persian Gulf and support for militant groups targeting American forces. This dual approach seeks to drive a wedge between Arab states and Iran's primary adversaries. The strategy reflects Iran's adaptation to changing regional dynamics, including diminished U.S. engagement in the Middle East and opportunities created by Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.
