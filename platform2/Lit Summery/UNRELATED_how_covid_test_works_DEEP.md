# COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Testing: Mechanism, History, and Development

## How Do COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests Work?

 ([File:COVID 19 Antigen Test - Testkassette.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:COVID_19_Antigen_Test_-_Testkassette.jpg)) *A typical COVID-19 antigen test cassette with control (“C”) and test (“T”) indicators. Here only the control line is visible, indicating a negative result.* 

**Sample Collection and Loading:** The test process begins with obtaining a sample (e.g. nasal swab) containing the virus if present. The swab is mixed into a liquid buffer and added to the test’s sample well (often labeled “S”). The liquid sample wicks onto a **sample pad** at one end of a paper-like strip and is drawn inward by **capillary action** ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=A%20typical%20COVID,regions%20embedded%20within%20the%20strip)). 

**Conjugate Pad – Labeled Antibodies:** As the sample fluid migrates, it dissolves reagents stored on the **conjugate pad**. This pad contains antibodies that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen (usually the nucleocapsid protein) which are **conjugated to colored nanoparticles** (commonly gold particles giving a red color) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=A%20typical%20COVID,regions%20embedded%20within%20the%20strip)) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=First%2C%20at%20a%20,41)). If the viral antigen is present in the sample, these **labeled antibodies** bind to it, forming antigen–antibody complexes as the fluid moves along.

**Nitrocellulose Membrane – Test Line Formation:** Next, the liquid carries the immune complexes onto a nitrocellulose membrane where the **test line** (often marked “T”) is located. Here a second set of antibodies (fixed to the membrane) is arranged in a thin line. These immobilized antibodies are designed to capture the viral antigen as well, but at a different epitope – creating a **“sandwich”**: the viral antigen is bound on one side by the moving labeled antibody and on the other side by the stationary capture antibody ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20allowing%20liquid,and%20a%20colored%20line%20is)) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=First%2C%20at%20a%20,41)). If antigen is present, the complexes **accumulate at the test line**, and the concentrated nanoparticles produce a visible colored band ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=specific%20capture%20antibodies%20were%20applied,lateral%20flow%20immunoassay%20was%20born)). This is why a positive result shows a line at “T.” The color is typically red (from gold nanoparticles) or another visible hue – the nanoparticles’ optical properties make the line appear once enough of them collect ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=sample%20and%20form%20an%20antibody,lateral%20flow%20immunoassay%20was%20born)). (The scientific principle is that gold or latex particles exhibit a strong color when many are concentrated in one spot.)

**Control Line and Completion:** The fluid continues to migrate past the test line to the **control line** (“C”). The control line is coated with a molecule (often an anti-species antibody) that binds any excess labeled antibodies whether or not they caught antigen ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=sample.,41)) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=at%20the%20control%20line%20,41)). This produces a second colored line to indicate the test strip functioned correctly – it “controls” for proper flow and reagent activity. Finally, the fluid is absorbed into the **wick (absorbent pad)** at the strip’s end, which prevents backflow and pulls the sample across the strip to completion.

**Interpreting the Result:** The outcome is read by noting the presence or absence of visible lines at “T” and “C.” If the **target antigen is absent**, the labeled antibodies have nothing to bind at the test line and simply travel onward – resulting in **no line at T**. They still bind at the control line, yielding **only a single line at C** (indicating a **negative test**) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=If%20there%20are%20no%20SARS,43)). If the antigen **is present**, some labeled antibody–antigen complexes will be captured at **T**, forming a colored test line, while the remaining labeled antibodies produce the control line. This yields **two lines (T and C)**, indicating a **positive test** ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=If%20there%20are%20no%20SARS,43)). (Even a faint T line is typically considered positive, since it means some antigen was caught.) The control line must always appear for the test to be valid; if C is blank, the test is faulty or the procedure was incorrect. In summary, the rapid antigen test uses a **lateral flow immunoassay** to detect viral proteins: the sample flows through pads that create an antibody–antigen–antibody “sandwich” on the test line, resulting in a colored line if the virus is detected ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=specific%20capture%20antibodies%20were%20applied,lateral%20flow%20immunoassay%20was%20born)) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=First%2C%20at%20a%20,41)).

**Visible Chemistry:** These tests cleverly turn an invisible molecular recognition event into a clear visual readout. The **gold nanoparticles** commonly used are red in color when aggregated, so as the antibody-nanoparticle conjugates accumulate at the test line, a red band appears. No instrumentation is needed – the result is read by eye in about 15 minutes. This simplicity and speed make lateral flow antigen tests useful for at-home and point-of-care COVID-19 screening.

## Historical Development of Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIAs)

The lateral flow immunoassay format has its origins in the latter 20th century, building on earlier immunodiagnostic ideas from the 1960s–1980s and reaching commercial success by the 1990s. Key milestones include:

- **1950s–1960s – Early Immunoassay Concepts:** Researchers began devising ways to detect antibodies and antigens outside the body. In 1956, Plotz and Singer developed a **latex agglutination** test for rheumatoid factor, using latex beads coated with antibodies that clump visibly when the target is present ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=The%20technology%20on%20which%20lateral,in%20a%20process%20termed%20agglutination)). Around the same time, others invented **radioimmunoassay (RIA)** (Yalow and Berson, 1960) and later **enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)** (1971), proving that antibodies could be used for highly sensitive lab tests ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=assay%2C%20the%20first%20radioimmunoassay%2C%20designed,presence%20of%20insulin%20in%20human)) ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=Enzyme%20immunoassays%20evolved%20shortly%20after,the%20filing%20of%20three%20US)). These advances – using labeled antibodies to produce detectable signals – set the stage for simpler “on-paper” formats.

- **1970s–1980s – Concept of One-Step Strip Tests:** By the late 1970s, scientists were exploring whether immunoassays could be done on a self-contained strip of material by capillary action. A crucial insight was the use of **porous nitrocellulose membranes** as a solid phase to immobilize antibodies in a line, combined with **colored particles** for readout ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20allowing%20liquid,and%20a%20colored%20line%20is)). Throughout the mid-1980s, inventors filed patent applications describing a device where a liquid sample carries analyte-bound particles over a membrane with printed lines of antibodies – essentially the lateral flow format ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20allowing%20liquid,and%20a%20colored%20line%20is)). In 1986–1987, **three U.S. patents** from teams at **Becton Dickinson, Unilever, and Carter-Wallace** described the first lateral flow immunoassay designs ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=antibody%20production%20methodologies%2C%20nitrocellulose%20membrane,detection%20of%20human%20Chorionic%20Gonadotropin)) ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=dispensing%20practices,very%20first%20lateral%20flow%20immunoassays)). These patents captured the idea of a **“sandwich” assay on a strip**: if the target was present, two antibodies would bind it and form a colored line ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=specific%20capture%20antibodies%20were%20applied,lateral%20flow%20immunoassay%20was%20born)). The groundwork for modern LFIAs was laid.

- **1984–1988 – First Commercial Pregnancy Tests:** The **early application driving LFIA development was the home pregnancy test**, which detects the hormone hCG in urine. Researchers at Unilever (later Unipath) in the UK developed a dipstick pregnancy test that was **launched in 1985** under the **Clearblue** brand ([
        Lateral Flow Assays, the past, the present and the future    ](https://liftric.com/news/the-history-of-lateral-flow-assays#:~:text=%2A%201976%20,COVID19)). (This early version gave a result in about 30 minutes.) A few years later, in **1988, Clearblue introduced the first true one-step lateral flow pregnancy test**, delivering results in a few minutes ([Clearblue - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearblue#:~:text=Clearblue%20,result%20in%203%20minutes%2C)) ([Pregnancy test history 101 - Clearblue](https://www.clearblue.com/pregnancy-tests/pregnancy-test-history-101#:~:text=Pregnancy%20test%20history%20101%20,just%2030%20minutes%2C%20revolutionizing)). This product, marketed for home use, was a breakthrough: it showed that a complete immunoassay could be self-contained in a disposable strip. The nitrocellulose-based device was simple, fast, and required no instruments – features that define lateral flow tests to this day. The success of the home pregnancy test demonstrated the feasibility and market potential of LFIA technology.

- **1990s – Widespread Commercialization:** Following the pregnancy test, the 1990s saw an expansion of lateral flow tests into many areas of diagnostics. Companies like **Abbott Laboratories** and others introduced rapid tests for infectious diseases (e.g. rapid **HIV** and **strep throat** tests), leveraging monoclonal antibody technology to create specific, reliable strips. In 1994, the first rapid HIV antibody test using lateral flow (Abbott’s Determine HIV test) was deployed, allowing screening without lab equipment. By the late 1990s, **over-the-counter drug tests** and other point-of-care kits (for ovulation, influenza, etc.) were appearing. The basic architecture – sample pad, conjugate pad with labeled antibody, capture antibody line, control line – became a standard.

- **2000s – Refinement and Multipurpose Use:** In the 2000s, lateral flow assays became ubiquitous in medicine and beyond. Major diagnostic companies (***Abbott***, **Roche**, **Becton Dickinson**, **Quidel**, etc.) further improved the sensitivity and stability of tests. They incorporated better nanoparticles, refined antibody pairs, and sometimes reader devices for quantitative results. LFIAs spread to veterinary diagnostics, food safety (e.g. detecting pathogens or toxins), environmental testing, and bio-defense. By the 2010s, lateral flow tests were a multi-billion dollar industry, valued for their **low cost, ease of use, and rapid results** ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=technology%20that%20can%20be%20applied,environmental%20assessment%2C%20and%20for%20safety)) ([](https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/download/pdf/IBS_A_guide_to_lateral_flow_immunoassays.pdf#:~:text=1980s%20a%20huge%20range%20of,Lateral%20flow%20immunoassays%20are)). The stage was set for the technology to play a crucial role in future public health emergencies – as would soon become evident with COVID-19.

## Rapid Antigen Tests in the COVID-19 Pandemic

**Explosion of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Tests (2020–2021):** When COVID-19 emerged in 2020, scientists and companies rapidly applied lateral flow technology to detect the new coronavirus. In May 2020, just a few months into the pandemic, the U.S. FDA issued its first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 antigen test – the **Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA** (a fluorescent lateral flow test) ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=In%20May%202020%2C%20the%20US,44)). Over the subsequent months, multiple rapid tests for **SARS-CoV-2** were developed around the world. By *summer 2020*, U.S. health agencies partnered with manufacturers to roll out millions of tests: for example, in August 2020 the U.S. government agreed to purchase **150 million BinaxNOW** COVID-19 Ag tests from **Abbott Laboratories** ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=In%20August%202020%2C%20the%20United,46)). Abbott’s **BinaxNOW** is a paper card-based lateral flow test (using nasal swabs) that became one of the most widely used kits in North America. In Europe, companies like **Roche** (in partnership with SD Biosensor of Korea) launched rapid antigen tests by late 2020, producing tens of millions of kits per month to supply global demand ([Roche to launch SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test in countries accepting CE mark, allowing fast triage decisions at point of care](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-09-01b#:~:text=infected%20patients%20or%20a%20high,demands%20of%20healthcare%20systems%20globally)) ([Roche to launch SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test in countries accepting CE mark, allowing fast triage decisions at point of care](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-09-01b#:~:text=The%20launch%20is%20a%20partnership,Rapid%20Antibody%20Test%20in%20July)). 

**Notable COVID-19 Rapid Tests:** Several high-profile rapid antigen tests and their developers include:

- **Quidel QuickVue/Sofia:** *Quidel Corporation* (USA) was first to market in the U.S., with the Sofia analyzer-based test (May 2020) and later the QuickVue at-home strip. Quidel’s early start provided proof that antigen tests could detect COVID-19 in clinical use ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=In%20May%202020%2C%20the%20US,44)).

- **Abbott BinaxNOW:** *Abbott* (USA) launched BinaxNOW in August 2020, a simple card-format test requiring no instrument. It received broad distribution; the U.S. deployed it to schools, nursing homes, and homes, aided by a federal purchase of 150 million tests ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=In%20August%202020%2C%20the%20United,46)). BinaxNOW uses antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid and delivers results in 15 minutes with a visually read two-line result.

- **Roche/SD Biosensor:** *Roche* (Switzerland) partnered with *SD Biosensor* (South Korea) to distribute a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test internationally (approved under CE mark in Europe). At launch in Sept 2020, Roche announced production of 40 million tests per month, scaling to 100 million+ per month by year’s end ([Roche to launch SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test in countries accepting CE mark, allowing fast triage decisions at point of care](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-09-01b#:~:text=infected%20patients%20or%20a%20high,demands%20of%20healthcare%20systems%20globally)). These tests were used widely in hospitals and clinics for quick triage of patients.

- **Innova Lateral Flow Test:** *Innova Medical Group* (USA/UK) became known for supplying inexpensive COVID-19 test kits used for mass screening in the UK. The Innova test (developed with Chinese manufacturer Xiamen Biotime) was evaluated by Public Health England and Oxford University and approved for widespread use in late 2020. The UK government provided Innova kits for home testing and large events, though the product later faced some scrutiny over accuracy by the U.S. FDA ([COVID-19 rapid antigen test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test#:~:text=Innova%20voluntarily%20launched%20a%20Class,A%20week%20after%20the%20FDA%27s)). Nonetheless, it was a centerpiece of the UK’s public testing campaign in 2021.

These and numerous other companies (BD, Siemens, LumiraDx, etc.) introduced COVID antigen tests in an unprecedented mobilization of diagnostic manufacturing. By 2021, millions of people were self-testing at home using lateral flow kits – a public health strategy rarely seen before.

**Engineering New Antibodies for SARS-CoV-2:** A critical step in developing COVID-19 rapid tests was obtaining antibodies that specifically recognize the virus. SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen, so companies and research labs had to create monoclonal antibodies from scratch in early 2020 ([
            Development of a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid specific monoclonal antibody - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7849420/#:~:text=Detection%20of%20protein%20analytes%20requires,N)). Most antigen tests target the **nucleocapsid (N) protein** of the virus, a highly abundant internal protein. To get antibodies against N (or portions of the spike protein in some cases), scientists immunized animals (typically mice) with purified SARS-CoV-2 proteins and then used hybridoma technology or high-throughput library methods to isolate high-affinity antibodies ([
            Development of a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid specific monoclonal antibody - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7849420/#:~:text=Here%20we%20report%20the%20generation,the%20ability%20for%20these%20antibodies)). For example, one academic group in 2020 immunized mice with recombinant N and generated a panel of 41 monoclonal antibodies, of which several showed strong performance on lateral flow strips ([
            Monoclonal Antibodies against Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Variants for Detection of COVID-19 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8623253/#:~:text=sensitive%2C%20rapid%20diagnostic%20tests%20for,20%20other%20common%20respiratory%20pathogens)) ([
            Monoclonal Antibodies against Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Variants for Detection of COVID-19 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8623253/#:~:text=the%20SARS,could%20be%20detected%20by%20NP)). Companies similarly screened large numbers of candidate antibodies to find pairs that could form a sensitive **capture + detection** combination on a test strip. In some cases, existing antibodies for the related SARS-1 virus were examined for cross-reactivity, but ultimately most COVID test antibodies were new. By mid-2020, multiple teams had developed antibody sets that could detect SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant levels. These were incorporated into the above-mentioned products. The rapid identification and **engineering of antibodies** (including tweaks to improve stability or binding) was a triumph of immunology and biotech know-how, achieved in mere months. It laid the foundation for the reliable rapid tests that became available to the public.

**Accuracy and Use Cases:** COVID antigen tests generally sacrifice some analytical sensitivity in exchange for speed and convenience. Clinical evaluations showed that most kits detect ~70–90% of cases that PCR can detect, with higher sensitivity for those with high viral loads (the most infectious individuals) ([Oxford University and PHE confirm lateral flow tests show high specificity and are effective at identifying most individuals who are infectious | University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are#:~:text=,in%20symptomatic%20and%20asymptomatic%20individuals)). For example, the UK’s evaluation of the Innova test found ~77% overall sensitivity, but **over 95% sensitivity for samples with high virus levels**, and extremely high specificity (only ~0.3% false positives) ([Oxford University and PHE confirm lateral flow tests show high specificity and are effective at identifying most individuals who are infectious | University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are#:~:text=,in%20symptomatic%20and%20asymptomatic%20individuals)). This meant antigen tests were very good at quickly finding people who were likely contagious. Public health experts like Dr. Michael Mina argued that frequent home antigen testing could catch infections during the most transmissible window and thereby curb outbreaks, even if the tests miss some low-level cases. Indeed, when used for **screening**, these tests helped identify asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases that would otherwise go unnoticed. Many countries deployed rapid tests for reopening schools, workplaces, travel, and events. By late 2021, with vaccines available, antigen tests became an important **complementary tool** – allowing individuals to check their status before gatherings or when feeling mild symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic thus demonstrated the value of lateral flow assays on a massive scale, familiarizing millions with the concept of a rapid immunoassay.

## Champions and Innovators in Rapid Testing

Developing and advocating for COVID rapid tests required efforts from both scientists and public health leaders. Several key figures and teams played notable roles:

- **Dr. Michael Mina (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health):** An epidemiologist and immunologist, Dr. Mina became one of the most vocal proponents of widespread rapid antigen testing. In mid-2020, he urged a shift in pandemic strategy toward cheap, frequent at-home testing – even if the tests were less sensitive than PCR – arguing this could massively interrupt transmission. He famously stated that ubiquitous rapid tests could be “**akin to a vaccine**” in their effect, by quickly identifying infectious individuals so they could isolate ([Cheap, frequent COVID tests could be ‘akin to vaccine,’ professor says — Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/#:~:text=A%20Harvard%20epidemiologist%20and%20expert,an%20approximation%20of%20normal%20life)) ([Cheap, frequent COVID tests could be ‘akin to vaccine,’ professor says — Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/#:~:text=The%20strategy%2C%20if%20adopted%20and,transmission%20chains%20across%20the%20country)). He emphasized that a paper strip test costing under $1, used daily or every few days, might curb COVID spread more effectively than only doing infrequent lab tests. Dr. Mina’s public advocacy (through interviews, op-eds, and press conferences) raised awareness of rapid tests as a public health tool. His ideas influenced policy discussions and helped push regulators to authorize more at-home kits. He also collaborated with groups designing such tests. His advocacy highlighted the gap between science and regulation – at one point, he lamented that “we have the technology, it’s just not being deployed.” By late 2020, Mina’s vision started coming to fruition as regulatory agencies approved several at-home antigen kits. He has continued to promote innovative testing strategies beyond COVID-19, illustrating how a scientist’s voice can shape pandemic response.

- **Irene Bosch, PhD, and E25Bio (MIT):** On the development side, Dr. Irene Bosch and colleagues in Cambridge, MA, were pioneers in creating a rapid COVID test. Bosch, a scientist affiliated with MIT, co-founded **E25Bio**, a startup originally working on dengue and Zika rapid tests. When COVID hit, her team swiftly adapted their technology to SARS-CoV-2. By **spring 2020**, they had a working 15-minute antigen test resembling a pregnancy strip – one of the earliest prototypes in the U.S. ([Biotech startup with MIT Tata Center roots produces 15-minute tests ...](https://energy.mit.edu/news/mit-tata-center-startup-e25bio-produces-15-minute-tests-for-covid-19/#:~:text=Biotech%20startup%20with%20MIT%20Tata,the%20presence%20of%20the)) ([This Scientist Created a Rapid Test Just Weeks Into the Pandemic ...](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-scientist-created-a-rapid-test-just-weeks-into-the-pandemic-heres-why-you-still-cant-get-it#:~:text=This%20Scientist%20Created%20a%20Rapid,8%20million)). The test used antibodies on a paper strip to detect the viral protein. Bosch’s group reportedly had a product ready for trials by April 2020, demonstrating remarkable speed. This effort showed how academic spin-offs could pivot to emerging threats. Although E25Bio’s COVID test did not immediately obtain FDA authorization (partly due to regulatory hurdles at that time), the work of Bosch and MIT collaborators proved invaluable. It provided a template for other companies and underscored the importance of **academic-industry partnerships**. MIT researchers also contributed improvements in test design – for example, exploring novel nanoparticle labels and smartphone-based readers to enhance sensitivity. The **MIT community** thus played a key role both in innovation and in stressing the importance of deploying rapid tests widely.

- **University of Oxford and U.K. Scientists:** In the United Kingdom, experts from Oxford University were instrumental in validating and championing rapid tests for national use. Professors and clinicians at Oxford, including **Sir John Bell** (Regius Professor of Medicine), led rigorous evaluations of various COVID-19 LFTs in partnership with Public Health England. By November 2020, their studies showed that certain tests, like Innova, had high specificity (~99.7%) and would catch the most infectious cases effectively ([Oxford University and PHE confirm lateral flow tests show high specificity and are effective at identifying most individuals who are infectious | University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are#:~:text=,in%20symptomatic%20and%20asymptomatic%20individuals)). Sir John Bell became a public advocate for these findings, stating that cheap lateral flow tests “**can play a major role in our fight against COVID-19**” and that when used in mass testing, they *“could reduce transmissions by 90%”* ([Oxford University and PHE confirm lateral flow tests show high specificity and are effective at identifying most individuals who are infectious | University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are#:~:text=Sir%20John%20Bell%2C%20Regius%20Professor,our%20fight%20against%20COVID%2019)) ([Oxford University and PHE confirm lateral flow tests show high specificity and are effective at identifying most individuals who are infectious | University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are#:~:text=%27They%20identify%20those%20who%20are,could%20reduce%20transmissions%20by%2090)). His backing lent scientific credibility to the U.K.’s decision to roll out millions of tests for asymptomatic screening in schools, workplaces, and even for city-wide pilot programs (like the Liverpool mass-testing trial). Oxford teams also helped develop protocols for self-administration and interpretation of the tests, making them more practical. Moreover, Oxford (along with other U.K. universities) contributed to improving test accuracy – for instance, by determining optimal sampling methods (nasal vs. throat swabs) and training materials for the public. The collaboration between Oxford scientists and government agencies exemplified how academic research can directly inform policy and implementation. Their work likely saved lives by picking up cases that would not have been detected otherwise. 

- **Other Contributors:** Many others deserve mention. Researchers at Harvard’s **Wyss Institute** (like Prof. James Collins) developed innovative diagnostics, such as a CRISPR-based paper strip test for COVID-19, illustrating alternative rapid test modalities ([Cheap, frequent COVID tests could be ‘akin to vaccine,’ professor says — Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Paper)). Teams at the **NIH RADx initiative** (a U.S. program to accelerate diagnostics) provided funding and validation for numerous startup products. In California, Dr. Jennifer Doudna’s group (UC Berkeley) also worked on CRISPR rapid tests. While these nucleic-acid tests differ from antigen LFIAs, the collective push for **rapid, frequent testing** had many champions in the scientific community. Each played a part in expanding the toolkit for managing COVID-19, emphasizing speed, accessibility, and frequency of testing as complements to vaccines and other measures.

In summary, the rapid test story was not just about technology, but also about advocacy and leadership. Visionary scientists like Mina and Bell helped the world recognize that **“fast and cheap” tests, used broadly, can be enormously powerful in a pandemic**, even if they aren’t perfect. Their efforts, along with the hard work of development teams at places like MIT and Oxford, brought the concept of at-home testing from fringe idea to mainstream reality.

## Beyond Viruses: Lateral Flow in Drug Testing and Other Uses

Lateral flow immunoassays are versatile – the same core technology is used not only for medical diagnostics like COVID or pregnancy, but also for detecting various substances including drugs of abuse. **Home drug-testing kits** (for substances such as cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines in urine) often employ lateral flow strips very similar in design to a rapid antigen test. They have a sample pad, conjugate pad with labeled antibodies, a test line, and a control line. The key difference is in the **assay format: competitive vs. sandwich.** Because many drug molecules are small and have only one antigenic site, they are detected using a **competitive immunoassay** rather than a sandwich.

Here’s how a typical **urine drug test strip** works: The strip is pre-coated with **drug-specific antibodies** and a corresponding drug-protein conjugate. When the urine (sample) flows through, it picks up **labeled drug molecules** (or drug analogues) from the conjugate pad. These labeled drug particles are designed to bind the antibody on the test line. **If the urine contains the drug in question, those drug molecules will compete with the labeled ones for the antibody binding sites at the test line** ([Lateral Flow Immunoassays - Jackson ImmunoResearch](https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/technical/products/applications/elisa/lateral-flow/immunoassays-introduction#:~:text=labeled%20drugs%20or%20other%20molecules,Figure%203b)) ([Lateral Flow Immunoassays - Jackson ImmunoResearch](https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/technical/products/applications/elisa/lateral-flow/immunoassays-introduction#:~:text=The%20test%20line%20is%20coated,Figure%203b)). When the sample has a significant amount of the drug, it **blocks** the test line antibodies from capturing the labeled particles – thus **no colored line forms at the test line** ([
            Lateral flow assays - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4986465/#:~:text=the%20antibody%20in%20the%20particular,independently%20of%20the%20test%20result)) ([Lateral Flow Immunoassays - Jackson ImmunoResearch](https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/technical/products/applications/elisa/lateral-flow/immunoassays-introduction#:~:text=The%20test%20line%20is%20coated,Figure%203b)). This absence of a line is interpreted as a **positive result for the drug** (meaning the person’s sample has the drug). Conversely, **if the drug is not present in the urine, nothing competes with the labeled proxy**; the labeled particles bind to the test line antibodies freely and produce a visible line, indicating a **negative result** ([Lateral Flow Immunoassays - Jackson ImmunoResearch](https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/technical/products/applications/elisa/lateral-flow/immunoassays-introduction#:~:text=The%20test%20line%20is%20coated,Figure%203b)). The control line works similarly to other tests – capturing excess labeled particles as a procedural control.

In simpler terms, drug tests often use the **“no line = positive”** logic, opposite to sandwich assays. This can be counter-intuitive at first glance but makes sense given the chemistry. The design still relies on antibodies’ specificity: for example, an antibody might recognize THC (cannabis metabolite). The strip has THC attached at the test line. If THC is in the urine, it prevents the antibody from binding the line; if urine has none, the antibody binds the THC on the strip and shows a line. This competitive lateral flow format is widely used for **illicit drug screening**, as well as for certain hormone tests or toxin tests where the analyte is a small molecule.

**Similarities to Antigen Tests:** Both drug tests and COVID tests use the same physical components (pads, nitrocellulose membrane, colored labels) and both rely on **antigen-antibody binding**. In each case, the appearance of colored lines indicates the presence or absence of a target compound. They are **rapid, portable, and require no machines**, making them useful for home use or field use. The development of drug test strips in the 1990s paralleled that of other LFIAs – leveraging monoclonal antibodies that could specifically snag molecules like cocaine metabolites or opiates. Just as a COVID test has antibodies that lock onto a virus protein, a drug test has antibodies that lock onto a drug compound. In fact, many of the manufacturing techniques (like spraying antibody onto a membrane or freeze-drying reagents on a pad) are identical between drug tests and medical tests.

**Applications:** Beyond medical diagnostics and drug screening, lateral flow assays have proliferated into areas like **food safety** (e.g. detecting bacterial contamination or allergens), **environmental monitoring** (e.g. checking water for pollutants), and **veterinary medicine** (e.g. rapid tests for animal diseases). The appeal is universal: an easy-to-use test that gives a yes/no answer within minutes. Whether it’s a parent testing their teenager or a health worker testing for malaria, the underlying technology – antibodies, nanoparticles, capillary flow – is the same. Over decades, refinements in antibody production and materials have improved these tests’ accuracy. But the fundamental concept, as demonstrated by drug tests, remains elegant and simple: a **lab-on-a-strip** that brings immunoassay out of the laboratory and into anyone’s hands.

## A Century of Antibody Science: Key Discoveries and Innovators

The power of rapid tests (and indeed much of modern medicine) rests on our understanding of **antibodies** – the immune proteins that specifically recognize pathogens and molecules. The concept of using antibodies as “magic bullets” was born from groundbreaking work over the past 130+ years. Here we highlight some key figures and their contributions to antibody science, leading up to today’s advanced monoclonal antibodies:

- **Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915):** Often called the father of immunology, Ehrlich in the late 19th century developed the **side-chain theory** to explain how antibodies work. He imagined cells having side-chain receptors that bind to toxins like a lock-and-key, and when engaged, the cell would produce and shed more of those receptors – essentially predicting the antibody response ([Paul Ehrlich | Science History Institute](https://www.sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/paul-ehrlich/#:~:text=In%201908%20Ehrlich%20shared%20the,the%20immune%20system%20were%20necessary)) ([Paul Ehrlich | Science History Institute](https://www.sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/paul-ehrlich/#:~:text=an%20understanding%20of%20the%20immune,the%20immune%20system%20were%20necessary)). Ehrlich coined the term **“magic bullet”** to describe a substance that could selectively target a pathogen without harming the host ([Paul Ehrlich | Science History Institute](https://www.sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/paul-ehrlich/#:~:text=match%20at%20L169%20antibodies%2C%20in,first%20described%20as%20magic%20bullets)). This concept underlies using antibodies or drugs to specifically seek out disease agents. Ehrlich’s work on diphtheria antitoxin (in collaboration with Behring) and his side-chain theory earned him a share of the **1908 Nobel Prize** in Physiology or Medicine ([Paul Ehrlich | Science History Institute](https://www.sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/paul-ehrlich/#:~:text=In%201908%20Ehrlich%20shared%20the,the%20immune%20system%20were%20necessary)). An anecdote: Ehrlich was also a pioneer in chemotherapy – he screened hundreds of dyes and chemicals looking for ones that would bind microbes (“magic bullets”). This led to Salvarsan, the first effective treatment for syphilis. In antibody history, Ehrlich’s vision that the body produces a vast array of specific molecules to fight disease was truly prescient.

- **Emil von Behring (1854–1917) & Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853–1931):** These two worked together in Berlin in the 1890s and discovered **antitoxins** – antibodies in blood serum that could neutralize toxins from infectious diseases. In 1890, Behring and Kitasato demonstrated that injecting rabbits with weakened tetanus or diphtheria toxins led to blood sera that could **protect other animals** from those diseases. They had essentially produced **the first therapeutic antibodies**. Behring then developed a diphtheria antitoxin therapy by immunizing horses and harvesting their serum – this serum contained antibodies that, when given to patients, cured diphtheria. This was a medical revolution: previously, diphtheria was often fatal to children, but antitoxin serum could save lives. Behring was honored with the **first-ever Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901** for this work. Kitasato, meanwhile, did parallel work on tetanus antitoxin and also co-discovered the bacterium that causes bubonic plague. Together, they established the concept of **humoral immunity** – that substances in the blood (we now know them to be antibodies) can confer protection. Their “serum therapy” laid the groundwork for vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments. It was a direct precursor to using polyclonal sera or monoclonal antibodies as drugs.

- **Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943):** An Austrian biologist, Landsteiner made a discovery in 1901 that not only revolutionized immunology but also clinical medicine: the **ABO blood group system**. By systematically mixing blood samples from different people, Landsteiner noticed some combinations led to clumping (agglutination) while others did not. He deduced that human red blood cells have differing surface **antigens** (which he labeled A, B, or none [O]), and people have antibodies against the antigens they lack ([Karl Landsteiner | Nobel Prize-Winning Immunologist & Pathologist | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Landsteiner#:~:text=University%20of%20Vienna%2C%20where%20he,to%20certain%20antigens%20located%20on)) ([Karl Landsteiner | Nobel Prize-Winning Immunologist & Pathologist | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Landsteiner#:~:text=the%20surface%20of%20red%20blood,work%20made%20it%20possible%20to)). If incompatible blood is mixed, those antibodies cause cell clumping. This explained why some blood transfusions were deadly and others successful. Thanks to Landsteiner, doctors could now match blood types and perform safe transfusions – a practice that has saved countless lives. Landsteiner received the **Nobel Prize in 1930** for this work ([Karl Landsteiner | Nobel Prize-Winning Immunologist & Pathologist | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Landsteiner#:~:text=Karl%20Landsteiner%20,transfusion%20a%20routine%20%2082)). Beyond blood groups, Landsteiner also conducted classic experiments in immunochemistry, demonstrating that antibodies could be raised against small synthetic molecules (haptens). In 1906, he showed that injecting an animal with a chemically modified protein could produce antibodies specific to that chemical group, highlighting the exquisite **specificity of antibody-antigen interactions**. He authored “The Specificity of Serological Reactions” (1936), a foundational text. Landsteiner’s insights cemented the idea that **antigenic determinants** (even very small ones) are what antibodies recognize – a principle exploited in designing diagnostics and vaccines.

- **Georges Köhler (1946–1995) & César Milstein (1927–2002):** These two scientists (one German, one Argentine) together achieved one of immunology’s greatest breakthroughs in 1975: the creation of **monoclonal antibodies**. Prior to their work, antibodies for research or therapy came from animal sera (a mixture of many antibody types). Köhler and Milstein, working at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, invented the **hybridoma technique** ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=Nowadays%2C%20the%20antibodies%20that%20are,perhaps%20better)). They fused a short-lived antibody-producing B cell from a mouse spleen with an immortal myeloma (cancer) cell. The resulting hybrid cells (hybridomas) combined the virtues of both parents: they could grow indefinitely *and* secrete a specific antibody. By isolating single hybrid cells, the team could culture a line that produces one unique antibody – a **monoclonal antibody** (mAb). Their landmark paper in *Nature* (1975) demonstrated this with antibodies against sheep red blood cells. It was a paradigm shift: now an unending, uniform supply of a defined antibody could be made. In the ensuing years, monoclonal antibodies transformed diagnostic testing (home pregnancy tests after that used monoclonals for consistency) and eventually medicine (as targeted therapeutics for cancer, autoimmune disease, etc.). Köhler and Milstein, along with immunologist Niels Jerne, received the **Nobel Prize in 1984** for this innovation ([The history of LFA – Senova](https://www.senova.de/en/the-history-of-lfa/#:~:text=Nowadays%2C%20the%20antibodies%20that%20are,perhaps%20better)). Anecdotally, their collaboration was serendipitous – Milstein had been studying myeloma cells, and Köhler arrived as a postdoc interested in antibody diversity. Their idea to fuse cells built on earlier observations by Henry Kunkel and others, but they were the first to make it practical. Monoclonal antibodies are now a cornerstone of biotech, earning billions in drug revenue and enabling countless laboratory assays (including the capture antibodies and conjugates in rapid tests!).

- **Sir Gregory “Greg” Winter (1951–present):** Building on Köhler and Milstein’s legacy, Greg Winter – a molecular biologist at Cambridge – made critical advances that allowed antibodies to become human medicines. In the 1980s, therapeutic monoclonals were initially from mouse cells, and patients could react against these foreign proteins. Winter devised methods to **“humanize” antibodies**: replacing most of the mouse antibody structure with human antibody sequences, keeping only the key binding regions from the mouse part (["A very Cambridge story"](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/antibodies-research-nobel-prize#:~:text=Image)). In 1986, he produced the first humanized antibody, making the drug less immunogenic. Winter didn’t stop there. He then pioneered **phage display** techniques in the early 1990s to create fully human antibodies in vitro (["A very Cambridge story"](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/antibodies-research-nobel-prize#:~:text=When%20Winter%20developed%20%E2%80%98antibody%20phage,of%20bacteriophage%20virus%20coat%20proteins)). Phage display involves inserting antibody gene fragments into bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) – effectively creating libraries of billions of antibodies displayed on the phage surfaces. Using this, Winter and colleagues could **evolve antibodies** to bind targets without using lab animals. This led to the world’s first fully human antibody drug, adalimumab (Humira), derived from a phage display library by the company Cambridge Antibody Technology, which Winter co-founded (["A very Cambridge story"](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/antibodies-research-nobel-prize#:~:text=The%20Cambridge%20Phenomenon)). Sir Greg Winter’s innovations earned him the **Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018** (shared with George Smith, who invented phage display, and Frances Arnold) ([The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry: phage display of peptides and ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30888467/#:~:text=The%202018%20Nobel%20Prize%20in,of%20peptides%20and%20antibodies)) (["A very Cambridge story"](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/antibodies-research-nobel-prize#:~:text=,of%20target%20using%20a)). His work is a prime example of translating basic science into real-world impact: today, many monoclonal drugs (for cancers, inflammatory diseases, etc.) are humanized or human antibodies made possible by Winter’s methods. He also showed an entrepreneurial spirit, founding multiple biotech companies around antibody engineering. Winter’s career illustrates how far antibody science has come since Ehrlich – from mysterious “side-chains” to the deliberate design of antibodies as precision tools.

These milestones – from Ehrlich’s theories to Winter’s engineered antibodies – each represent turning points in our understanding of immunology. They also laid the foundation for **modern diagnostics and therapeutics**. For instance, lateral flow tests rely on monoclonal antibodies (thanks to Köhler and Milstein) that are often humanized or recombinant (thanks to Winter) to improve stability. The ability to produce specific antibodies in large quantities has enabled the **rapid test revolution** – without monoclonals, every batch of a test could vary, but with them, we have consistency and specificity.

## How Monoclonal Antibodies Are Made Today (From Immunization to Gold Conjugates)

Modern monoclonal antibody production is a sophisticated process marrying immunology and cell culture. The goal is to generate a **large batch of identical antibodies** that bind a chosen target (antigen). Here is an overview of the typical steps involved:

1. **Immunization & Immune Response:** Scientists begin by selecting a target antigen – for a COVID test, this might be the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. They inject the antigen into a host animal, usually a mouse (sometimes multiple mice), over several weeks. The mouse’s immune system recognizes the antigen as foreign and activates B lymphocytes to produce antibodies against it. After a series of booster immunizations, the mouse will have **B cells** (in its spleen or lymph nodes) that secrete high-affinity antibodies specific to the target ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Immunization)).

2. **Isolating B Cells and Cell Fusion:** Next, the antibody-producing B cells are harvested (often from the spleen). However, B cells alone won’t survive long in a dish. To immortalize their antibody-producing ability, researchers fuse these B cells with a long-lived **myeloma cell line** (a type of cancer cell) using a reagent like polyethylene glycol or an electric pulse ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20Cell%20Fusion)). This fusion creates hybrid cells called **hybridomas**, each of which can both **divide indefinitely** (thanks to the myeloma part) and **produce the antibody** that the original B cell was making ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Hybridoma%20technology%20involves%20fusing%20short,1)) ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=to%20an%20antigen,2)). The fusion is inefficient – many cells don’t fuse successfully – so the mixture is then cultured in a special selective medium (HAT medium) that allows only fused cells to survive. This ensures that the output is hybridomas, not unfused cells ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Less%20than%201%20percent%20of,1)).

3. **Screening for the Desired Antibody:** Now comes a critical step – finding which of the many hybridoma cells is producing the antibody we want. Each hybridoma is derived from a different B cell, so each secretes a different antibody. Scientists distribute the cells into microtiter plates (so that each well hopefully contains a single hybridoma clone) and let them grow. The supernatant (liquid) from each well is tested for reactivity to the target antigen. A common method is **ELISA**: the target antigen is coated on a plate, incubated with each hybridoma’s supernatant, and binding is detected with a secondary antibody and color change ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Screening)). Wells that show strong binding contain hybridomas making a useful antibody. Other methods like Western blot or flow cytometry can also characterize the antibody’s properties ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Screening)). Through this **screening**, researchers identify one or a few hybridomas that produce antibodies with the desired specificity and affinity.

4. **Cloning and Expansion:** Once a candidate hybridoma is identified, it is usually “cloned” to ensure monoclonality – meaning derived from a single cell. This can involve diluting and re-culturing to isolate single-cell progeny or using methods like cloning rings. The goal is a stable cell line that produces one antibody. That hybridoma clone is then expanded in culture flasks or bioreactors, or even injected into a mouse peritoneal cavity (in vivo production), to produce large amounts of the **monoclonal antibody** in fluid ([Understanding Hybridoma Technology for Monoclonal Antibody Production | The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/understanding-hybridoma-technology-for-monoclonal-antibody-production-71108#:~:text=Step%205%3A%20Hybridoma%20Expansion)). The antibodies are secreted into the culture medium (or mouse ascites fluid) and can be harvested.

5. **Purification and Characterization:** The antibody molecules are purified using chromatography (such as Protein A affinity columns that bind the antibody’s Fc region). The purity and concentration are assessed. The antibody is also characterized – verifying it binds the target strongly and specifically, and checking that it does not cross-react with unintended targets. At this stage, genetic sequencing of the hybridoma can determine the antibody’s exact gene sequence, which is useful if one wants to produce it recombinantly.

6. **Conjugation to Nanoparticles (for Lateral Flow Use):** To use the monoclonal antibody in a lateral flow test, one portion of the antibodies (typically the ones that will be in the conjugate pad) are **labeled with nanoparticles**. For example, antibodies can be attached to **colloidal gold particles**, which will later provide the colored signal ([
            Lateral flow assays - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4986465/#:~:text=,cost)). Gold conjugation is often done by simple incubation – antibodies adsorb to gold nano-spheres and stabilize them. Another portion of the antibodies will be **immobilized on the test line** (usually without labels) as capture antibodies. These are dispensed onto the nitrocellulose in a precise line and dried. The control line gets a different antibody (e.g. anti-mouse IgG) to catch the flowing conjugate. The remaining reagents (buffers, blocking proteins, etc.) are also applied. Finally, the strip is assembled with the sample pad (often pre-treated with salts and surfactants to help the sample flow and reduce nonspecific binding) and absorbent pad, and housed in a plastic cassette.

After these steps, the result is a batch of test strips loaded with that specific monoclonal antibody pair – one on particles, one on the membrane. Each strip will behave identically given the consistency of monoclonal reagents. The test can then be packaged and shipped. In modern production, **high-throughput screening and recombinant DNA techniques** are also used: some companies now bypass hybridomas by using yeast or phage display libraries to generate antibodies, then clone the antibody genes into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for scalable manufacturing. But even then, the general workflow – generate antibody diversity, select the best binder, clone it, produce it, attach label – is the same.

In essence, monoclonal antibody production takes advantage of an animal’s immune system to get the initial specificity, and then cell culture to provide a renewable source of that antibody. It is a beautiful fusion of nature’s ingenuity and laboratory control. The process can take a few months from immunization to finalized antibodies. For COVID-19, many groups worldwide undertook this process in early 2020 at breakneck speed to churn out the antibodies needed for diagnostic kits.

## From Lab to Market: Institutions and Companies Driving Rapid Test Technology

The development of rapid antigen tests has been a collaborative effort between **academic research institutions** and **biotechnology/diagnostics companies**. Turning antibody science into a convenient product requires innovations at the bench as well as mass-production and distribution. Here are some of the key players and their roles:

- **Academic and Research Institutions:** Universities and research institutes have been the wellspring of fundamental advances that made rapid tests possible. For example, **MIT** and **Harvard** have long histories in diagnostic research – Harvard’s Wyss Institute developed novel paper-based diagnostic platforms that were repurposed for COVID-19 ([Cheap, frequent COVID tests could be ‘akin to vaccine,’ professor says — Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Paper)), and MIT engineers have worked on nanosensor and microfluidic test innovations. During the pandemic, academic labs provided early prototypes (as seen with MIT’s E25Bio) and helped validate tests. They also trained the workforce that joined diagnostic companies. **Oxford University** in the UK not only contributed to evaluating tests (as discussed with Sir John Bell’s group) but also spun out companies and provided expertise in assay development. Academic hospitals ran clinical trials to assess new rapid tests’ performance, generating the data needed for regulatory approval. In essence, academia supplied **key ideas, skilled researchers, and credibility**. The interplay is seen in how a concept from research – say using CRISPR to detect viral RNA or a new way to make antibodies – can quickly be taken up by companies to enrich their product pipeline.

- **Biotech and Diagnostic Companies:** The translation of immunoassay science into an actual product that sits on pharmacy shelves is largely done by companies. Firms like **Abbott, Roche, Quidel, Becton Dickinson,** and many smaller diagnostics companies have the manufacturing facilities, quality control, and distribution networks to produce rapid tests at scale. They take the antibodies (often licensed or co-developed with academics) and integrate them into user-friendly formats. For instance, Abbott leveraged its experience in lateral flow to rapidly develop BinaxNOW, then produced it in enormous quantities – something an academic lab alone could never do. **Quidel** and **BD** similarly ramped up production of their kits for hospitals and consumers. Companies also innovate on the **engineering** side: creating better sample collection swabs, developing reader devices for digital results, improving shelf-life of tests through stabilizing reagents, etc. Importantly, large companies navigate the **regulatory landscape** (FDA, CE marking) to get tests approved and **marketed worldwide**.

- **Public-Private Partnerships:** The pandemic saw unprecedented collaboration. In the U.S., the NIH **RADx program** injected funding into promising testing technologies, connecting academic inventors with manufacturing partners. In the UK, the government worked with Oxford and private suppliers like Innova to secure tens of millions of tests. These partnerships helped speed up scaling and deployment. Organizations such as the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation** also funded the development and distribution of rapid tests (for COVID and other diseases) in lower-resource settings, bridging gaps between nonprofit goals and commercial entities.

- **Notable Contributions:**
    - **Abbott Laboratories** – Used its global reach to deliver COVID tests to numerous countries and also worked on improving access (e.g. pairing BinaxNOW with a mobile app for result reporting). Abbott’s core laboratory division has decades of immunoassay expertise (it was involved in early HIV test development), exemplifying how prior knowledge was redirected to COVID.
    - **Roche Diagnostics** – Brought high-quality manufacturing and an existing customer base (hospitals, clinics) to distribute rapid tests broadly. Roche’s partnership with SD Biosensor combined SD’s innovative test design with Roche’s validation and distribution. This synergy shows how companies often collaborate across continents to get a product out.
    - **Quidel** – As a mid-sized company specializing in point-of-care tests (flu, strep, etc.), Quidel was nimble in responding to COVID. It worked closely with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to scale up. Quidel’s **first-to-market** status in the U.S. gave other manufacturers confidence to follow.
    - **Startups and Small Firms** – Dozens of smaller companies, some university spin-offs, contributed new ideas. For example, *LumiraDx* created a microfluidic immunofluorescence COVID test with higher sensitivity, and *Ellume* (Australia) made an electronic at-home COVID antigen test. These companies often originated from academic research and received backing to commercialize their novel approaches.

- **Harvard & MIT contributions to deployment:** Beyond developing technology, researchers from these institutions influenced how tests were used. Michael Mina at Harvard (now affiliated with the startup eMed) pushed for public health implementation. MIT’s broad tech expertise meant many alumni and researchers joined or formed companies to disseminate rapid tests. For example, **David Walt** at Harvard developed ultrasensitive digital immunoassays that, while not lateral flow, advanced the limits of detection – such knowledge trickles into improving conventional tests. The **Broad Institute** (MIT/Harvard) helped validate the performance of various antigen tests against PCR, providing independent data.

In sum, bringing a rapid antigen test from an idea to a mass-produced product required a **chain of innovation**: initial discovery (often academic), development and optimization (jointly by academics and companies), manufacturing (industry), and advocacy and implementation (public health experts and governments). The COVID-19 experience underscored this ecosystem. When it functioned well, highly effective tools were delivered in record time. For instance, by **December 2020**, barely 9–10 months after the virus’s identification, countries like Germany and the UK had authorized multiple at-home antigen tests and were distributing them to their populations – a feat impossible without tight coordination between university labs, companies like Roche/Abbott, and regulatory bodies.

Moving forward, the collaboration between research institutions and diagnostics companies continues to be crucial. Researchers are now working on next-generation lateral flow tests (for example, more sensitive nanoparticle labels or multiplexed strips that detect multiple viruses in one). Companies are incorporating these findings to build better products (e.g. combo tests for COVID and flu). The line between academic and commercial efforts has blurred in the field of diagnostics, and that’s largely positive for innovation. The end result is that society gets access to remarkable technologies – like a piece of paper that can tell if you have COVID-19 in minutes – which stand on the shoulders of decades of scientific progress and organizational teamwork.
