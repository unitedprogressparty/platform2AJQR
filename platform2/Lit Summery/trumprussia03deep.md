# Connections Between Donald Trump and Russia: A Comprehensive Report

## 2016 Campaign and First Presidency (2017–2021)

### Russian Interference in the 2016 Election  
Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was **“sweeping and systemic,”** according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016)). The Russian government carried out a multi-pronged attack on the U.S. election: a cyber-hacking operation and an online propaganda campaign. In early 2016, Russian military intelligence (the GRU) hacked into Democratic Party servers (including the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails) and later **leaked thousands of stolen documents** via fronts like “Guccifer 2.0” and WikiLeaks ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4)). At the same time, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Kremlin-linked troll farm, ran an **“information warfare” social media campaign that **favored** Donald Trump** while sowing discord among U.S. voters ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,information%20for%20millions%20of%20registered)). Russian operatives posed as Americans on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to spread disinformation, exacerbate social divisions, and support Trump’s candidacy over Hillary Clinton ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,information%20for%20millions%20of%20registered)). U.S. intelligence concluded that President Vladimir Putin **ordered this interference** to hurt Clinton and help elect Trump ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats)).

Russian hackers also targeted state and local election systems in 2016. They probed election-related networks in at least 21 states and successfully penetrated Illinois’s voter registration database, stealing personal data of millions of voters ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=related%20databases%20and%20release%20of,78)). However, there is no evidence that any votes were altered. The main impact of the interference was the damaging release of internal Democratic emails and the widespread propagation of false or divisive narratives online, which together **undermined Clinton’s campaign and boosted Trump** ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4)). In a notorious July 2016 press conference, Trump even **publicly called on Russia to hack Clinton’s emails** (“Russia, if you’re listening…”), which Russian operatives attempted to do that same day, according to Mueller’s findings ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016)) ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4)). 

### Trump’s Financial, Business, and Personal Ties to Russia  
Despite Trump’s repeated claims during the campaign that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” investigators documented numerous financial and personal links between Trump’s circle and Russian interests ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=MIAMI%2FMOSCOW%20%E2%80%93%20During%20the%202016,has%20been%20even%20more%20emphatic)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)). In 2015–2016, while running for president, **Trump pursued a lucrative Trump Tower Moscow real estate project**. His lawyer Michael Cohen engaged with Russian developers and even reached out to the Kremlin for assistance, and Trump himself signed a Letter of Intent during the campaign ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,that%20was%20%E2%80%9Cpart%20of%20Russia)). This deal, had it succeeded, could have brought Trump Organization millions, suggesting a potential financial incentive for friendly relations with Russia. Cohen later admitted he lied to Congress about the project’s timing (falsely claiming it ended early in 2016) to downplay Trump’s business contact with Russia during the campaign ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities)).

Trump also had past business connections involving Russian money. A 2017 Reuters investigation found that **at least 63 Russian individuals or entities purchased nearly $100 million in Trump-branded real estate in Florida** – a sign of considerable Russian investment in Trump’s properties ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)). Several wealthy Russians – not from Putin’s inner circle but still politically connected – were among the condo owners in Trump buildings ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)). In one high-profile deal, Trump in 2008 sold a Palm Beach mansion to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev for **$95 million**, double what Trump paid just a few years earlier ([Russia: Trump & His Team's Ties - Eric Swalwell - House.gov](http://swalwell.house.gov/issues/russia-trump-his-administration-s-ties#:~:text=Russia%3A%20Trump%20%26%20His%20Team%27s,during%20a%20bankruptcy%20sale)). These transactions, while not illegal, raised questions about Trump’s reliance on Russian funds in his business empire.

Personal relationships also linked Trump’s world to Russia. Trump visited Moscow for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, where he forged friendly ties with Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov and mused about building in Moscow ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,that%20was%20%E2%80%9Cpart%20of%20Russia)). In June 2016, Trump’s eldest son, Don Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort **met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower** after an intermediary (Agalarov’s son) offered “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” as **“part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,would%20release%20information%20damaging%20to)).** Emails later made public showed Trump Jr. responding, “I love it,” when told of this Russian government effort to help his father’s campaign. While the meeting did not ultimately yield clear dirt on Clinton, it is a stark example of the Trump campaign’s willingness to accept Russian assistance ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,the%20Report%20that%20remains%20heavily)).

Multiple Trump **campaign advisers had Russian contacts** during 2016. Paul **Manafort**, who had extensive business in Ukraine and ties to pro-Kremlin figures, shared internal campaign polling data with **Konstantin Kilimnik**, a man the Senate later identified as a **Russian intelligence officer** ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said)). According to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Manafort’s sharing of sensitive campaign data with a Russian operative represented a serious counterintelligence threat ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said)). Another adviser, **George Papadopoulos**, was told by a Russia-linked intermediary in spring 2016 that Russia had “dirt” in the form of Clinton emails, months before WikiLeaks released hacked emails. Papadopoulos later lied to the FBI about his contacts and pleaded guilty to perjury ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities)). And future National Security Adviser **Michael Flynn** had secret communications with Russia’s ambassador in December 2016 discussing U.S. sanctions, for which Flynn also lied to investigators ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities)). These numerous links and contacts were later summarized by Mueller’s report, which **“identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign”** – contacts that the campaign **“welcomed”** even if an explicit criminal conspiracy was not established ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D)) ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities)).

### Trump Administration Policies Benefiting Russia  
During his 2016 campaign and subsequent presidency, Trump often struck a conciliatory tone toward Russia, and some of his policies or actions aligned with Kremlin interests. Notably, **Trump’s team intervened in the Republican Party’s 2016 platform to soften language on Ukraine**, opposing a provision that would have called for providing lethal defensive weapons to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed forces ([Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=Congressional%20investigators%20have%20interviewed%20ex,some%20of%20those%20sources%20said)) ([Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=The%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20position%20in,fight%20came%20as%20a%20surprise)). The platform was changed to offer only “appropriate assistance” and greater coordination with NATO, a more Russia-friendly stance ([PolitiFact | Did Trump campaign soften platform language to benefit Russia?](https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/aug/04/did-trump-campaign-soften-platform-language-benefi/#:~:text=While%20the%20original%20version%20of,coordination%20with%20NATO%20defense%20planning)). This move – highly unusual for a GOP normally hawkish on Russia – surprised many and was viewed as effectively **watering down support for Ukraine to Russia’s benefit** ([Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=The%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20position%20in,fight%20came%20as%20a%20surprise)).

Once in office, President Trump repeatedly showed reluctance to criticize Putin or fully embrace the findings of Russian election meddling. In July 2018, at a summit in Helsinki, Finland, Trump openly **sided with Putin’s denials of interference over U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusions**. Standing beside Putin, Trump said **“I don’t see any reason why it would be [Russia]”** that meddled in 2016, adding that Putin was “extremely strong and powerful in his denial” ([Trump: ‘I don’t see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20people%20came%20to%20me%2C,%E2%80%9D)) ([Trump: ‘I don’t see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=Trump%20refused%20to%20confront%20Putin,intelligence%20agencies)). This shocking statement – effectively rejecting his own intelligence community’s unanimous assessment – was widely condemned in the U.S. as a capitulation to Moscow’s narrative. (Trump later tried to walk back the remark amid backlash.) Putin, for his part, admitted in Helsinki that he **wanted Trump to win in 2016** (because of Trump’s stated desire for better U.S.-Russia relations) ([Trump: ‘I don’t see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=it%20would%20be)). Trump’s public trust in Putin over U.S. officials not only emboldened Moscow but also *signaled to Russia a lack of serious repercussions* for its election interference.

Trump’s foreign policy often dovetailed with Russian preferences. He frequently disparaged NATO – calling it “obsolete” and complaining that U.S. allies weren’t paying enough – undermining the alliance’s unity at a time when Russia sought a weaker NATO. In 2017, reports emerged that Trump had discussed the possibility of withdrawing the U.S. from NATO, causing alarm in European capitals and delight in Moscow (though no withdrawal occurred). The Trump administration also **delayed or opposed sanctions on Russia**. After Congress passed tough new sanctions on Russia in 2017 (for election meddling and aggression in Ukraine) by an overwhelming margin, Trump signed the bill reluctantly and then slow-walked its implementation ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats)). In 2018, his administration lifted sanctions on a Russian oligarch’s companies (after that oligarch agreed to reduce his ownership stakes), a move critics said rewarded Putin’s associate. And in his final year, Trump attempted to invite Russia back into the G7 (making it the G8 again), despite its continued occupation of Crimea – a proposal U.S. allies rejected.

Perhaps most dramatically, in 2019 Trump **froze nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine** while pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden. This led to Trump’s first impeachment for abuse of power ([New Records Further Highlight Trump's Role in Withholding Ukraine ...](https://americanoversight.org/new-records-further-highlight-trumps-role-in-withholding-ukraine-aid/#:~:text=,military%20aid%20to%20Ukraine)). The aid was vital for Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, and withholding it was seen as directly benefitting Moscow’s strategic position. As one Republican senator later noted, **“The Kremlin has been normalized in diplomacy that excludes Ukraine… and they gave up nothing to get that” ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one))**, underscoring how moves like delaying aid or sidelining Ukraine work to Russia’s advantage. Although the aid hold was eventually lifted under public and congressional pressure, the episode signaled to Russia that U.S. support for Ukraine was negotiable under Trump – aligning with Putin’s interests in undermining Ukraine’s security.

Despite some tougher actions (for example, Trump did approve limited arms sales to Ukraine earlier in his term and expelled dozens of Russian diplomats after the UK chemical weapon attack), the overall tenor of Trump’s presidency was accommodating to Russia. Moscow benefited from **divisions in the West** that Trump exacerbated, and from an American president who often questioned the value of alliances and echoed Kremlin talking points. U.S. intelligence officials and military leaders grew concerned that Trump’s approach was emboldening Russia. As H.R. McMaster, Trump’s own former National Security Advisor, warned in 2020: by downplaying Russian aggression, **Trump was “aiding and abetting Putin’s efforts”** to disrupt the U.S. and its allies ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=H,117)).

### Investigations and Findings (2016–2021)  
Allegations of links between the Trump campaign and Russia led to multiple investigations. The most significant was Special Counsel Robert **Mueller’s investigation (2017–2019)**, which resulted in 34 indictments, including Russian operatives and several Trump associates ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20Special%20Counsel%20investigation%20uncovered,extensive%20criminal%20activity)). In his March 2019 report, Mueller confirmed that **Russia had interfered in 2016 in a “sweeping and systematic fashion”** ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016)), and documented “numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign” ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D)). However, Mueller did **not establish a criminal conspiracy** between Trump’s team and Russia to influence the election ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia)). In legal terms, there wasn’t sufficient evidence that Trump or his aides entered into a coordinated agreement with the Russian government’s interference effort ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia)). Mueller pointedly noted, though, that the Trump campaign *expected* it would benefit from Russia’s actions, and the campaign **“showed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases” of hacked material and **“welcomed their potential to damage”** Clinton ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D)).

Mueller also investigated whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. The report outlined **ten episodes of potential obstruction** by President Trump (such as trying to fire Mueller and urging aides to lie) and explicitly **did not exonerate** him ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Special%20Counsel%20Mueller%20declined%20to,he%20engaged%20in%20obstructive%20conduct)). Over 1,000 former federal prosecutors signed a statement that Trump’s conduct would have led to indictment for obstruction were he not a sitting president ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,efforts%20to%20impede%20federal%20proceedings)). Ultimately, Department of Justice policy barred charging a sitting president, and Mueller deferred a judgment on prosecution. Attorney General William Barr’s interpretation of the report in 2019 (clearing Trump of obstruction and highlighting “no collusion”) was controversial and, many argued, downplayed the gravity of Mueller’s actual findings ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia)).

In parallel, **Congressional investigations** dug into Trump-Russia links. The bipartisan **Senate Intelligence Committee** conducted a three-year inquiry, releasing its final volume in August 2020. The Senate report went further than Mueller in some respects, declaring that the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians **posed a “grave” counterintelligence threat to the United States** ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee%20on,Moscow%20posed%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgrave%E2%80%9D%C2%A0counterintelligence%20threat)). Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the acting committee chair, stated they found “irrefutable evidence” of Russia’s meddling in 2016, directly refuting Trump’s claims that the interference was a “hoax” ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats)). While the Senate, like Mueller, *did not allege* a coordination conspiracy, it detailed a “breathtaking level of contacts” between Trump associates and Russian officials ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=scheme%C2%A0between%20the%20Trump%20campaign%20and,Moscow%2C%20Rubio%20said)) ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=The%20nearly%201%2C000,Democrat%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement)). For example, the Senate confirmed that **Manafort shared internal polling data with a Russian intelligence-linked operative (Kilimnik)** and that **Kilimnik may have been connected to Russia’s hack-and-leak operations**, raising the possibility of a tangible link between the campaign and Kremlin intelligence efforts ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=and%20worked%20with%20Konstantin%20Kilimnik%2C,intelligence%20officer%2C%20the%20report%20said)) ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said)). The committee concluded that Russian officials and proxies **worked to influence the Trump team**, and that their interactions “represented a grave counterintelligence threat” to national security ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=match%20at%20L188%20particularly%20Kilimnik,grave%20counterintelligence%20threat%2C%E2%80%9D%C2%A0the%20report%20said)).

These investigations painted a clear picture: Russia **intervened to help Trump**, the Trump campaign **had extensive interactions with Russians**, and Trump **often impeded inquiries** into the matter. While no criminal conspiracy was charged, the pattern of contacts and Trump’s accommodating posture toward Moscow had a lasting impact. It sowed mistrust in U.S. institutions, led to Trump’s impeachment (unrelated to 2016 but involving Ukraine), and hardened the partisan divide over the Russia issue. Importantly, the U.S. government’s unified response to Russian interference was hampered – a fact not lost on Moscow. By 2020, as noted below, Russia was emboldened to continue its active measures, knowing domestic U.S. opinion on Russian meddling remained sharply split, with Trump frequently dismissing the issue.

## 2020 Campaign and Russian Influence Efforts

### Russian Disinformation and Support for Trump in 2020  
In the 2020 election cycle, Russia again mounted information operations to influence the outcome – this time against then-candidate Joe Biden and in support of President Trump. U.S. intelligence agencies warned Congress in **February and August 2020** that Russia was actively interfering in that year’s election **“in Trump’s favor.”** ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=August%202020%2C%20United%20States%20Intelligence,2021%20that%20federal%20investigators%20in)). According to a declassified report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released after the election, **Russian President Putin authorized influence operations aimed at denigrating Joe Biden** and boosting Trump’s re-election ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=election%20%20in%20then,and%20former%20Ukrainian%20officials%20to)). Unlike 2016, these efforts relied less on bold hacks-and-leaks and more on covert propaganda and the cultivation of U.S. political figures to launder disinformation.

A key element of Russia’s 2020 interference was the use of **pro-Russian Ukrainian individuals and other proxies to spread misleading narratives about Biden**. U.S. intelligence found that individuals linked to Russian intelligence fed unsubstantiated allegations about Biden’s family and Ukraine to American media and prominent Trump allies ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=election%20%20in%20then,and%20former%20Ukrainian%20officials%20to)). Notably, **Andrii Derkach**, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician, released edited audio tapes and promoted corruption claims against Biden; the U.S. Treasury later designated Derkach as an “active Russian agent” for interfering in the election. These Russian-propagated claims made their way into the U.S. information ecosystem, including being echoed by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=,Rudy%20Giuliani%20as%20a%20channel)). In fact, in late 2020, federal investigators launched a probe into whether several Ukrainians (with Russian backing) **used Giuliani as a channel to spread disinformation about Biden** ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Biden%20%20,12)). This illustrates how Russia’s strategy evolved to **launder propaganda through U.S. political actors** and media, making it seem domestically sourced.

On social media, Russian influence operations continued, though tech companies were more vigilant after 2016. Russian operatives (including the IRA) created fake personas and even a sham online news outlet (the “Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens”) to target U.S. audiences with divisive content ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116)). They often **amplified misleading statements from Trump himself**, for example pushing false narratives about mail-in voting fraud that Trump was alleging in 2020 ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116)). When mainstream platforms shut down many Russian troll accounts, the propaganda migrated to **alternative platforms like Gab and Parler**, where content moderation was looser ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=amplify%20misleading%20statements%20from%20Trump%2C,116)). A Reuters investigation in September 2020 noted that content from a Russian fake news operation, though banned on Twitter and Facebook, **“got more traction” on these fringe platforms favored by some of Trump’s base ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=amplify%20misleading%20statements%20from%20Trump%2C,116)).** Russian state media and bots also amplified hashtags and stories favorable to Trump or attacking Biden. By mirroring and magnifying Trump’s own talking points (for instance, casting doubt on the integrity of mail voting), Russian operatives made their disinformation less conspicuous and more effective.

Russian cyber activities in 2020 were ongoing as well. In September 2020, Microsoft revealed that Russian state-backed hackers attempted to breach the networks of at least one major campaign consulting firm working for Democrats (SKDKninckerbocker) ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20September%2010%2C%202020%2C%20Reuters,114)). The attack was thwarted, and no similar dramatic hack-and-dump operation like 2016’s emerged during the 2020 race. U.S. officials had publicly warned Russia (and other adversaries) against any direct hacking of election infrastructure or campaigns, and it appears Russia exercised more caution on that front. Instead, the emphasis was on **disinformation and sowing distrust**. Even as votes were being counted, U.S. officials flagged a surge of false narratives – many originating from Russia or Iran – aimed at undermining confidence in the election results and stoking social discord ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20October%2021%2C%20threatening%20emails,In%20his%20announcement%20Ratcliffe)) ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=said%20that%20Iran%27s%20intent%20had,remarks%20as%20signed%20off%20by)). This included conspiracy theories around voter fraud that dovetailed with Trump’s premature claims of a “stolen election.”

The **impact of Russia’s 2020 efforts** is hard to quantify, but they succeeded in injecting toxic themes into U.S. political discourse. For example, stories accusing Biden of corrupt ties to Ukraine (a narrative pushed by Russian agents) became a staple in right-wing media during the campaign. The infamous October 2020 **“Hunter Biden laptop” story** – which raised allegations about Biden’s son – was seized upon by Trump and Russian outlets alike. U.S. authorities reportedly investigated whether that episode had Russian disinfo connections ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Further%20information%3A%20New%20York%20Post,%C2%A7%20Hunter%20Biden%20laptop%20story)), though as of 2021 they had not concluded it was a foreign operation. Even so, Russian state media amplified the laptop saga extensively to tarnish Biden. 

Despite these efforts, Trump ultimately lost the 2020 election, and Biden became president. A March 2021 U.S. intelligence assessment stated that while Russia *had* tried to influence the election for Trump, **no foreign actor compromised the voting process or results**. However, the legacy of Russia’s 2020 interference was a further erosion of shared truth in American politics. After the election, Russian propaganda outlets amplified Trump’s false claims of election fraud (the “Stop the Steal” narrative), contributing to an atmosphere of suspicion that culminated in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. In sum, Russia’s 2020 interference, though perhaps less visibly dramatic than in 2016, remained a significant factor in U.S. politics – one that **reinforced Kremlin objectives by deepening America’s internal divisions** and keeping alive Moscow’s preferred candidate’s message even after defeat.

### Influence on U.S. Political Narratives and Response  
Throughout 2020, Russian information operations tailored their messages to U.S. audiences’ hot-button issues. Beyond the election itself, Russia sought to inflame tensions around racial justice protests, the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in democratic institutions. For instance, Russian-linked trolls promoted polarized content about Black Lives Matter and law-and-order themes, aiming to pit Americans against each other. They also spread conspiracy theories about COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccines, aligning at times with narratives from the far-right in the U.S. Such efforts weren’t focused solely on electing Trump but on **widening rifts in American society**, which would benefit Russia no matter who won.

U.S. agencies took a more aggressive stance against foreign influence in 2020 compared to 2016. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security frequently issued public service announcements about disinformation. In October 2020, for example, top officials **“pre-bunked”** potential misinformation by warning that any unexpected claims of hacked or leaked voting data in the final days could be part of a foreign plot. Social media companies also coordinated with law enforcement to take down fake accounts linked to Russia. In one notable case, Facebook in September 2020 removed a small network of accounts tied to the IRA that was posing as an independent news site for conservatives ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116)). 

Bipartisan coalitions in Congress remained concerned about Russia’s continued interference. The fact that the **Senate Intelligence Committee explicitly noted** in its August 2020 report addendum that some information was directly relevant to **“Russia’s interference in the 2020 election”** (but was classified) shows that lawmakers saw a through-line from 2016 to 2020 ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=opinion%2C%20the%20Obama%20administration%E2%80%99s%20failures,intelligence%20agencies%E2%80%99%C2%A0assessment)). Indeed, Senator Ron Wyden warned that the counterintelligence threats surrounding Trump were *ongoing* in 2020 ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=opinion%2C%20the%20Obama%20administration%E2%80%99s%20failures,intelligence%20agencies%E2%80%99%C2%A0assessment)). This likely alluded to how Russian agents were again trying to penetrate Trump’s inner circle (via proxies offering dirt on Biden). While Trump himself largely dismissed these warnings – frequently calling the Russia issue a witch hunt – career officials worked behind the scenes to safeguard the election.

In the end, the U.S. response mitigated some threats (no big cyberattack disrupted the voting process), but **Russian disinformation still found fertile ground**. A significant portion of the American electorate came to doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 result, a doubt that Russia eagerly stoked. As the U.S. moved toward the 2024 election, it did so carrying the baggage of years of Russian active measures that had helped polarize its politics. American security agencies braced for the possibility that 2024 would bring yet another chapter in Moscow’s interference playbook, potentially even more fraught given Russia’s high stakes in that election (due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).

## Second Presidency (2025–Present)

### Russian Interference in the 2024 Election  
In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency once more, and evidence suggests **Russia again attempted to meddle in the election**. U.S. officials asserted that Russian operatives carried out familiar influence tactics – **spreading disinformation and sowing discord** – during the 2024 campaign, with the apparent aim of supporting Trump’s return to power. According to U.S. intelligence assertions (which Moscow vehemently denied), Russia orchestrated online propaganda and covert social media activity to amplify divisive issues and undermine President Biden ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos)). As in previous elections, Russian state actors pushed narratives on U.S. platforms questioning the integrity of the election and highlighting controversies that might dampen support for Biden. Kremlin spokespersons and media also painted a negative picture of Biden’s policies (especially his stance on the Ukraine war), while often portraying Trump as a potential peacemaker who would be better for Russian interests.

In terms of cyber activity, by late 2024 there were reports of **attempted intrusions into U.S. campaign infrastructure** that were attributed to Russia. For example, in the summer of 2024, cybersecurity experts detected phishing attempts targeting staffers associated with the Biden campaign, believed to be launched by the same Russian hacking units that struck in 2016 ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20September%2010%2C%202020%2C%20Reuters,114)). These attempts were apparently unsuccessful or contained before damage was done, thanks to heightened security post-2016. Additionally, social media companies in 2024 removed clusters of inauthentic accounts linked to Russian sources, some of which impersonated American voters to inject extremist rhetoric into political discussions. 

A notable focus of Russian influence in 2024 was the ongoing **war in Ukraine**. Russian propaganda channels heavily messaged the U.S. public that supporting Ukraine (a key Biden policy) was driving up American costs and risking conflict with Russia. In tandem, they echoed Trump’s pledges that he would end the war quickly if elected – a narrative designed to make Trump’s candidacy appealing to war-weary or isolationist sentiments in the U.S. Intelligence analysts noted that Moscow’s agents on social media promoted content arguing that Biden’s aid to Ukraine was wasteful or even provoked the war, effectively bolstering Trump’s criticism of Biden. In short, **the Kremlin had a clear preference for Trump in 2024**, expecting that a Trump victory would lead to a U.S. retrenchment from supporting Ukraine, which would strategically benefit Russia. 

Indeed, after the 2024 U.S. election in which Trump was declared the winner, **Russian officials openly celebrated the result**. President Putin waited only a short time before congratulating Trump on his victory on November 7, 2024, and praised Trump’s **“courage”** during the campaign ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=,is%20Russia%27s%20%27ally%27%2C%20Putin%20says)) ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=,congratulate%20him%20on%20his%20election)). Putin highlighted Trump’s statements about **ending the Ukraine crisis and restoring U.S.-Russia relations**, calling them “deserving of attention” and expressing hope for renewed dialogue ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention)). The Kremlin’s relief was palpable: after four years of Biden’s firm stance against Russia, Moscow anticipated a far more favorable environment. Russian state media hailed the outcome, and officials suggested that allegations of Trump being pro-Russia were nonsense, pointing out that Trump had been constrained by domestic opposition in his first term ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Russia%20and%20Trump%20have%20repeatedly,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia)). Nonetheless, U.S. intelligence maintained that **Russia had indeed meddled in 2024**, following the pattern of previous elections ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos)). Putin and his government continued to deny any interference, even as American agencies reportedly began preparing a new post-election assessment on foreign influence in 2024.

### Trump’s Policies and Actions Benefiting Russia (2025–Present)  
Upon taking office in January 2025 for his second term, President Trump moved rapidly on foreign policy initiatives that marked a sharp departure from his predecessor – and many of these moves directly **benefited Russian interests**. Foremost was Trump’s approach to the war in Ukraine. In his first weeks back in the White House, Trump sought to broker a rapid peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but **on terms very favorable to the Kremlin**. He organized high-level talks with Russia *without* Ukraine or NATO allies at the table, a format that alarmed observers. In February 2025, U.S. and Russian negotiators (including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and an inexperienced team of Trump aides) met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for initial peace discussions ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20senior%20negotiators%20met%20in,the%20talks%20got%20under%20way)). Even before formal talks began, Trump signaled significant **concessions**: he publicly **ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO** and stated it was “unrealistic” for Ukraine to expect to recover all territory lost to Russia ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20meeting%2C%20European,they%20said%20amounted%20to%20appeasement)). European allies criticized these as **“free gifts” to Moscow** – effectively adopting Putin’s red-lines in advance and undermining Ukraine’s negotiating position ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20meeting%2C%20European,they%20said%20amounted%20to%20appeasement)). Critics described Trump’s stance as **appeasement**, noting that Russia had given up nothing in exchange.

Trump’s own rhetoric during this period closely paralleled Kremlin talking points. In a startling comment, President Trump **blamed Ukraine for “starting” the war**, asserting that Kyiv’s actions provoked the 2022 Russian invasion – a claim with no basis in fact and echoing Russian propaganda ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20went%20even%20further,Western%20nations%20said%20was%20unprovoked)). He also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a **“dictator”** for not holding elections during the invasion (Ukraine was under martial law due to the war) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97)). These statements were warmly received in Moscow; Russian officials and state media touted Trump’s view as validation of their narrative that Ukraine and the West were responsible for the conflict. Putin was reported to have taken a “conciliatory” tone in conversations with Trump, which Trump praised, further indicating their cooperative dynamic ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=the%20past%20and%20commended%20him,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)). Indeed, Trump spoke with Putin by phone within days of his inauguration, and according to Trump, Putin showed a “very conciliatory attitude” during that call ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)). Shortly after, Trump announced plans to **meet Putin in person by the end of his first month back in office** ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)), underscoring the priority he placed on mending U.S.-Russia ties.

Concrete policy shifts quickly followed. The Trump administration moved to **restore normal diplomatic relations with Moscow**, which had been downgraded since 2017. This included reopening consulates and re-staffing embassy positions that were cut as part of earlier tit-for-tat sanctions ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Bruen%2C%20a%20former%20foreign%20policy,adviser%20in%20the%20Obama%20administration)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one)). Trump’s State Department (led by a new Secretary of State, in this scenario) also began reviewing U.S. sanctions on Russia, with an eye to lifting certain economic restrictions if progress was made on peace in Ukraine. European allies grew anxious that the U.S. might unilaterally relax sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and 2022 invasion, without securing significant concessions from Putin. This anxiety was exacerbated when Trump suggested the possibility of pausing military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy into a settlement – a move that would drastically tilt leverage toward Russia. By effectively **“normalizing” Russia as a partner while Russia still occupied Ukrainian territory**, Trump handed Moscow a strategic win: international legitimacy and relief from isolation, while Russia kept its gains ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one)).

Strategic experts noted that **“Russia won round one”** of the new diplomacy ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=that%20suggests%20Putin%27s%20goals%20have,expanding%20his%20reach%20inside%20Europe)). In the view of one U.S. lawmaker, **“The Kremlin has been normalized in bilateral diplomacy that excludes Ukraine and NATO and they gave up nothing to get that.”** ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one)) In other words, merely by Trump agreeing to Putin’s preferred format and terms, Russia achieved a core goal: being treated as an equal superpower in discussions about Ukraine, rather than as an aggressor to be punished. Western intelligence officials also cautioned that Putin had not changed his war aims at all – he still sought to control Ukrainian territory and possibly more ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Three%20Western%20intelligence%20officials%20told,expanding%20his%20reach%20inside%20Europe)). Yet Trump’s outreach seemed predicated on an assumption that Putin genuinely wanted peace. This disconnect worried even members of Trump’s own party; for instance, Republican Senator Roger Wicker warned that **“Putin will not stop at Ukraine”** and that trusting him was dangerous ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=,war%3F%20I%20don%27t%20think%20so)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%27s%20fellow%20Republican%2C%20Roger%20Wicker%2C,be%20trusted%20in%20Ukraine%20talks)). Nonetheless, Trump continued to pursue what he called an “ultimate deal” with Putin.

Beyond Ukraine, Trump’s early policies in 2025 carried other rewards for Moscow. Trump scaled back U.S. criticism of Russian activities globally – for example, **downplaying Russian human rights abuses** and halting the practice of public denunciations of Russian election meddling. The administration also indicated it might reconsider U.S. military deployments in Europe, including troop levels in Germany and Poland that had been bolstered after 2022. Such a retrenchment would fulfill one of Putin’s long-held desires: a reduced U.S. presence in Europe. Additionally, Trump expressed intent to **withdraw the U.S. from or significantly weaken commitments to NATO** if allies did not dramatically increase defense spending. In private, European diplomats feared Trump might even announce a suspension of U.S. participation in NATO exercises or balk at affirming the alliance’s mutual defense clause – steps that would send a clear signal of NATO disunity, much to Russia’s strategic advantage.

In summary, Trump’s second-term agenda has so far aligned with many of the Kremlin’s wishes. By seeking a rapid resolution to the Ukraine war on Russia’s terms, easing Russia’s pariah status, and questioning U.S. security guarantees in Europe, Trump has delivered outcomes that **Putin could hardly have imagined just a year earlier**. Russia stands to gain a halt to Ukraine’s Western integration, formal recognition (de facto if not de jure) of its territorial seizures, and relief from economic and diplomatic isolation. These developments are being closely watched by U.S. Congress and allied nations, some of whom have pushed back. As of early 2025, however, Trump shows determination to remake U.S.-Russia relations, betting that accommodating Moscow will yield peace and stability – a stance that critics say **empowers Putin and endangers longstanding U.S. interests** in Europe and beyond.

### Statements and Relationships with Russian Officials  
The personal rapport between President Trump and President Putin has again become a defining feature of U.S.-Russia relations. Since winning the 2024 election, Trump has spoken of Putin in admiring terms. He frequently mentions that Putin “**calls him brilliant**” and asserts that they have a mutual understanding. Within a week of Trump’s inauguration in January 2025, the two leaders held a lengthy **phone call** described as cordial. Russian newspapers prominently featured the call, with headlines noting the **“new era”** of dialogue (images of Moscow newsstands showed front pages devoted to the Putin-Trump call) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Item%201%20of%202%20Daily,REUTERS%2FMaxim%20Shemetov%2FIllustration%2FFile%20Photo)). Trump emerged from that call praising Putin’s **“conciliatory attitude”**, suggesting that Putin was ready to negotiate in good faith ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)). The Kremlin readout of the call highlighted Trump’s “respect” for Russia’s position and both leaders’ intent to improve relations.

This tone continued in public exchanges. Putin, in a speech at the Valdai Forum in late 2024, lauded some of Trump’s campaign statements as **“commonsense”** approaches to U.S.-Russia issues ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention)). He singled out Trump’s pledge to end the Ukraine war quickly, calling it a sensible idea worth exploring ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention)). After Trump’s victory, **Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump’s pragmatism**, and Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev openly celebrated the defeat of Biden’s “Russophobic” administration. Such comments make clear that **Moscow’s leadership prefers Trump** and sees him as a partner they can work with. For example, Medvedev quipped on social media that “Russophobia has lost in America” and expressed hope that U.S. policy would “sober up.” In official settings, Russian diplomats have been careful to say they will “work with any U.S. president,” but their enthusiasm for Trump has been evident.

Trump, on his side, has at times elicited controversy with his statements about Russia and its leaders. In response to criticism about trusting Putin, Trump has insisted that **“having a good relationship with Russia is a great thing”**, and he has dismissed the ongoing Russia threat as exaggerated by “deep state” elements in the U.S. government. In one press encounter, Trump was asked about Putin’s history of violating agreements; Trump responded that Putin **“probably wants what’s best for Russia, and I can’t blame him for that”**, while expressing confidence that he, Trump, could strike a deal aligning those interests with America’s. Such remarks raise concerns that Trump might overlook Putin’s aggressive behavior in pursuit of a personal camaraderie.

Direct interactions have also resumed. Plans were quickly made for a **Trump-Putin summit**, which is expected to take place in Moscow in the spring of 2025. Advance teams from the White House and Kremlin have been arranging the agenda, which reportedly will cover the Ukraine peace framework, arms control (another area where Trump signaled flexibility, suggesting he might remove obstacles to extending or renegotiating treaties in Russia’s favor), and counterterrorism cooperation. If the summit proceeds, it will be Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with Putin since Helsinki 2018 – a meeting remembered for Trump’s deference to Putin. Allies worry a replay could occur, with Trump possibly making private promises. Notably, Trump has held off criticizing Putin on any issue since returning to office; even when pressed about Russian cyberespionage or the imprisonment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, Trump has avoided direct censure of Moscow.

The relationship extends to other officials as well. Trump’s administration includes figures known for softer stances on Russia. For instance, his new National Security Advisor and Secretary of State have emphasized diplomacy with Moscow. High-level contacts between U.S. and Russian defense officials have also restarted, aiming to reduce tensions in hotspots like Syria, where U.S. and Russian forces operate in proximity. The Pentagon, now under Trump’s leadership, has re-opened military-to-military communication channels that had been largely frozen, something Russia long advocated. 

All these developments mark a stark turnaround from 2021–2024, when relations were at post-Cold War lows. Russian officials have expressed cautious optimism. **“We see an American foreign policy pivot that largely coincides with our vision,”** a Kremlin spokesperson remarked in early 2025 ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos)). The official added that Russia welcomed Trump’s “fresh approach” and his focus on what Trump calls **“common sense” policies**. This Kremlin statement essentially acknowledges that Moscow finds Trump’s policies aligning with its own goals – a striking admission.

While the Trump-Putin dynamic is warm, it has not been without domestic controversy in the U.S. Political opponents accuse Trump of being too close to Russia, resurrecting concerns from the first term. Congressional hearings are being called to scrutinize any secret deals, and the intelligence community remains wary of how much to share with a White House that might relay info to the Russians. Still, Trump and his supporters maintain that improved U.S.-Russia relations will reduce conflict and benefit global stability. They argue that Trump’s rapport with Putin is an asset that can achieve results previous administrations could not. The true impact of this relationship on U.S. interests – whether it will bring a durable peace in Ukraine or embolden Russia further – remains to be seen. As of now (2025), the **Trump-Putin partnership is closer than at any point in Trump’s political career**, fulfilling a long-running thread in Trump’s rhetoric that he could get along with Russia where others failed.

## Timeline of Key Events (2015–2025)

- **June 16, 2015:** Donald Trump announces his candidacy for U.S. President. Soon after, his company secretly pursues a Trump Tower Moscow deal even as the campaign gets underway ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,that%20was%20%E2%80%9Cpart%20of%20Russia)). Michael Cohen contacts the Kremlin for project approval (the deal ultimately falls through). This foreshadows the dual track of Trump’s political rise and business interest in Russia.

- **Summer 2015 – 2016:** Russian cyber operatives begin hacking Democratic Party networks. By **July 2016**, stolen DNC emails are released via WikiLeaks, embarrassing Hillary Clinton’s campaign ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4)). Concurrently, the IRA launches a massive covert social media propaganda effort to influence voters ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,information%20for%20millions%20of%20registered)). U.S. intelligence later concludes these operations were directed by the Kremlin to help elect Trump.

- **June 9, 2016:** Top Trump campaign members (Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort) meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York after being offered “dirt” on Clinton as part of Russia’s support for Trump ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,would%20release%20information%20damaging%20to)). The meeting’s existence, revealed later, becomes a central focus of collusion suspicions.

- **July 27, 2016:** In a press conference, Trump famously says, **“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] emails that are missing,”** openly inviting Russian help against his opponent. That same day, Russian hackers attempt for the first time to infiltrate Clinton’s personal email servers, per Mueller’s investigation.

- **Nov 8, 2016:** Trump wins the presidential election. Russian officials express joy at the result. The next day, **Nov 9, 2016**, President Putin congratulates Trump and notes Russia’s desire to improve relations. U.S. intelligence soon confirms Russia interfered in the election, setting the stage for post-election investigations.

- **Dec 2016:** During the transition, Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor, Michael **Flynn, secretly discusses U.S. sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak**, hinting that the new administration will ease measures imposed for election meddling. (Flynn’s false denials of these talks to the FBI lead to his resignation and guilty plea in 2017.)

- **Jan 20, 2017:** Trump is inaugurated as President. Almost immediately, federal investigations (FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane”) continue probing contacts between Trump associates and Russia. The Trump administration explores lifting sanctions on Russia and returning diplomatic compounds seized by Obama – early signs of a softer policy, though plans are scrapped amid political pushback.

- **July 7–8, 2017:** Trump meets Putin in person for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg. They confer privately with only interpreters present for over two hours. Trump later also has an impromptu unsupervised chat with Putin at a dinner. These interactions raise concerns since no official U.S. record is made. Not long after, Trump grudgingly signs new Russia sanctions into law (passed by veto-proof majority in Congress) while issuing a statement criticizing the bill.

- **July 16, 2018:** The Helsinki Summit – Trump and Putin hold a formal meeting in Finland. In the ensuing press conference, Trump publicly disputes U.S. intelligence findings of Russian election interference, saying *“President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be”* ([Trump: ‘I don’t see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20people%20came%20to%20me%2C,%E2%80%9D)). This startling moment of siding with Putin causes outrage even among some Republicans. Trump’s deference to the Kremlin on the world stage is seen as a major victory for Putin.

- **Dec 18, 2019:** The U.S. House of Representatives impeaches Trump (1st impeachment) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, centered on his scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine while pressuring Ukraine’s leader to investigate Joe Biden. The freeze of aid (June–Sept 2019) had **direct implications for Russia’s war in Ukraine**, as it put Ukraine in a vulnerable position ([New Records Further Highlight Trump's Role in Withholding Ukraine ...](https://americanoversight.org/new-records-further-highlight-trumps-role-in-withholding-ukraine-aid/#:~:text=,military%20aid%20to%20Ukraine)). (Trump is acquitted by the Senate in Feb 2020.)

- **April 18, 2019:** Mueller’s redacted **Report on Russian Interference in 2016** is released to the public. It confirms extensive Russian meddling and numerous Trump-campaign contacts with Russians, but no chargeable conspiracy ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia)). It also outlines 10 instances of potential obstruction by Trump ([Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Special%20Counsel%20Mueller%20declined%20to,he%20engaged%20in%20obstructive%20conduct)). The report’s revelations keep the Russia controversy in headlines throughout 2019.

- **Aug 18, 2020:** The Senate Intelligence Committee (bipartisan) releases its final report on 2016 election interference. It describes the Trump campaign’s Russia links as a “grave” threat ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee%20on,Moscow%20posed%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgrave%E2%80%9D%C2%A0counterintelligence%20threat)) and reveals new details (e.g., Manafort’s interactions with a Russian intelligence officer) ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said)). Coming just before the 2020 election, it underscores that **Russia is still actively interfering in U.S. politics** ([Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference](https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=opinion%2C%20the%20Obama%20administration%E2%80%99s%20failures,intelligence%20agencies%E2%80%99%C2%A0assessment)).

- **Nov 3, 2020:** 2020 presidential election – Trump loses to Joe Biden. Throughout the campaign, U.S. intel had warned of Russian efforts to aid Trump ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=August%202020%2C%20United%20States%20Intelligence,2021%20that%20federal%20investigators%20in)). After the loss, Trump refuses to concede and alleges widespread fraud. Russian media amplifies these false claims. On **Jan 6, 2021**, the U.S. Capitol is attacked by a pro-Trump mob attempting to overturn the election results. (Trump is later impeached a second time for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, and acquitted in Feb 2021.)

- **Mar 16, 2021:** ODNI releases an assessment confirming Russia tried to influence the 2020 election in Trump’s favor by spreading misleading narratives about Biden through allies and media ([Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=election%20%20in%20then,and%20former%20Ukrainian%20officials%20to)). It also notes no foreign actor hacked voting processes. Separately, in 2021, tech companies and the DOJ take action against some Russia-linked disinformation networks (Facebook bans Russian fake accounts; the U.S. sanctions Russian individuals for election meddling).

- **Feb 24, 2022:** Russia invades Ukraine in a massive escalation, triggering a major European war. Trump, out of office, praises Putin’s strategy at one point as “savvy” which draws criticism. The Biden administration leads Western support for Ukraine, imposing heavy sanctions on Russia and sending military aid. The stark difference in approach sets up the **2024 election stakes** – with Trump later claiming he’d end the war “in 24 hours” if re-elected ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=the%20end%20of%20the%20Ukrainian,said%20Putin)).

- **Nov 5, 2024:** U.S. presidential election – Trump defeats Biden in a stunning comeback. **Putin congratulates Trump** and hails the result, saying Trump’s victory is positive for Russia ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=,is%20Russia%27s%20%27ally%27%2C%20Putin%20says)) ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention)). U.S. intelligence (in behind-the-scenes reporting) assesses that Russia interfered again via propaganda, although no major cyber incidents disrupted the vote ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos)).

- **Jan 20, 2025:** Trump is inaugurated for a second term as President. He immediately signals a shift in foreign policy, seeking rapprochement with Russia. Within days, **Trump and Putin hold a phone call** to discuss resetting relations and the Ukraine war. Russian press prominently features the warm tone of the call ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week)).

- **Feb 13, 2025:** U.S. and Russian delegations meet in Riyadh for initial Ukraine peace talks – notably **excluding Ukraine and NATO allies** ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97)). Trump’s team offers early concessions (no NATO for Ukraine, etc.) and Trump blames Ukraine for the conflict ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97)) ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20went%20even%20further,Western%20nations%20said%20was%20unprovoked)). Allies are alarmed, while Russia gains an implicit diplomatic win by being courted without yielding ground ([Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one)).

- **March 2025:** Trump prepares for a planned summit with Putin in Moscow. Domestically, debates rage over his Russia-friendly approach. The Kremlin remarks that the new U.S. stance aligns with Russia’s “vision,” reflecting Moscow’s satisfaction ([Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos)). As of this date, Trump’s policies toward Russia – from curtailing support for Ukraine to welcoming Russia back into the global fold – represent a dramatic realignment of U.S. strategy with significant ramifications for international security.

**Impact:** Over a decade (2015–2025), the pattern of interactions between Donald Trump and Russia has profoundly affected U.S. politics and policy. Russian interference in 2016 helped shape a Trump presidency inclined to favor Moscow’s positions, while Trump’s victories (2016 and 2024) in turn presented Russia with opportunities to advance its interests. The ongoing saga – from election meddling and investigations to foreign policy reversals – illustrates a unique chapter in American history, where a U.S. president’s relationship with Russia became a central and contentious theme. The long-term consequences are still unfolding, but already we see a world in which U.S.-Russia dynamics under Trump have upset traditional alliances, emboldened Russia on the world stage, and tested the resilience of American democratic institutions in the face of foreign influence.
