## Promoting Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and Girls Worldwide

Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for sustainable development, peace, and security. Despite progress, women and girls worldwide continue to face discrimination, violence, and barriers to participation in political, economic, and social life. Advancing gender equality and empowering women and girls is not only a matter of justice but also essential for achieving broader U.S. foreign policy goals, including economic growth, global health, and stability.

Our platform commits the United States to making the promotion of gender equality a central pillar of its foreign policy and development assistance. We advocate for comprehensive strategies to eliminate gender-based discrimination, combat violence against women and girls, promote women's leadership, and ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities.

### Key Strategies for Advancing Global Gender Equality:

1.  **Integrate Gender Equality Across All Foreign Policy and Aid:**
    *   Mandate the integration of gender analysis and gender equality objectives across all U.S. diplomatic efforts, development programs (USAID), trade policies, and security assistance.
    *   Appoint senior officials dedicated to advancing gender equality within the State Department and other relevant agencies.

2.  **Combat Gender-Based Violence (GBV):**
    *   Increase funding and support for international programs aimed at preventing and responding to all forms of GBV, including domestic violence, sexual assault in conflict zones, female genital mutilation (FGM), and child marriage.
    *   Support access to justice, healthcare (including sexual and reproductive health services), and psychosocial support for survivors of GBV.
    *   Champion international norms and legal frameworks aimed at ending GBV.

3.  **Promote Women's Economic Empowerment:**
    *   Support programs that enhance women's access to education, vocational training, financial services (credit, savings), land tenure security, and decent work opportunities.
    *   Advocate for legal and policy reforms in other countries that eliminate barriers to women's economic participation (e.g., discriminatory inheritance laws, restrictions on property ownership).
    *   Support women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses globally.

4.  **Advance Women's Political Participation and Leadership:**
    *   Support programs that promote women's participation in political processes, leadership roles, and peace negotiations worldwide.
    *   Advocate for the removal of legal and social barriers to women's political engagement.
    *   Support women human rights defenders and civil society organizations working on gender equality.

5.  **Ensure Access to Education for Girls:**
    *   Prioritize global investments in girls' education at all levels (primary, secondary, higher), recognizing its transformative impact on health, economic opportunity, and empowerment. (See also section 6.6).
    *   Support efforts to eliminate barriers to girls' schooling, such as poverty, child marriage, and unsafe school environments.

6.  **Promote Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR):**
    *   Restore and increase U.S. funding for international family planning and reproductive health programs, recognizing that access to SRHR is essential for women's health, autonomy, and economic well-being.
    *   Support comprehensive sexuality education globally.
    *   Oppose policies like the global gag rule that restrict access to essential health information and services.

### Conclusion:

Advancing gender equality is central to achieving a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world. By integrating gender equality across our foreign policy, combating gender-based violence, promoting women's economic and political empowerment, ensuring access to education and healthcare, the United States can lead global efforts to realize the rights and full potential of women and girls everywhere. This commitment reflects core American values and strengthens global development and stability.
