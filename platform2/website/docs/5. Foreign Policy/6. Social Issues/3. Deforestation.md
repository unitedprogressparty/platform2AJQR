## Protecting the World's Forests for Climate, Biodiversity, and Livelihoods

Forests are critical ecosystems that regulate the global climate, harbor the vast majority of terrestrial biodiversity, provide essential resources, and support the livelihoods of billions of people, including Indigenous communities. However, deforestation and forest degradation—driven primarily by agricultural expansion (especially for commodities like palm oil, soy, and beef), logging, mining, and infrastructure development—continue at alarming rates, particularly in tropical regions. This destruction accelerates climate change, drives species extinction, and undermines human well-being.

Our platform calls for strong U.S. leadership and international cooperation to halt and reverse global deforestation. We advocate for policies that support sustainable land use, protect the rights of forest-dependent communities, eliminate deforestation from supply chains, and provide adequate financing for forest conservation and restoration.

### Key Strategies for Combating Global Deforestation:

1.  **Strengthen International Cooperation and Agreements:**
    *   Actively participate in and strengthen international forums and agreements aimed at combating deforestation (e.g., UN Forum on Forests, New York Declaration on Forests).
    *   Support international initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) with robust funding and strong social and environmental safeguards.

2.  **Promote Sustainable Land Use and Agriculture:**
    *   Use development assistance, trade policy, and diplomatic engagement to support countries in implementing sustainable land-use planning, strengthening forest governance, and promoting agricultural practices that reduce pressure on forests (e.g., agroforestry, intensification on existing land).
    *   Support efforts to clarify and secure land tenure rights for local communities and Indigenous peoples, recognizing their crucial role in forest conservation.

3.  **Eliminate Deforestation from Supply Chains:**
    *   Implement domestic regulations (e.g., import controls similar to the Lacey Act or EU Deforestation Regulation) to prohibit the import of commodities produced on illegally deforested land.
    *   Encourage and potentially mandate U.S. companies to adopt and implement zero-deforestation commitments throughout their global supply chains, ensuring transparency and traceability.
    *   Support international efforts to develop robust monitoring and verification systems for deforestation-free commodities.

4.  **Provide Financial Incentives for Forest Conservation:**
    *   Increase U.S. funding for international forest conservation and restoration programs, including bilateral aid and contributions to multilateral funds.
    *   Support innovative financing mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services and debt-for-nature swaps, that reward countries and communities for protecting forests.

5.  **Support Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities:**
    *   Recognize and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in forest governance and conservation efforts. Ensure their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) for projects affecting their lands and resources.
    *   Support community-based forest management initiatives that empower IPLCs as key stewards of forest ecosystems.

6.  **Combat Illegal Logging:**
    *   Strengthen international cooperation and enforcement efforts to combat illegal logging and associated trade, including support for timber legality verification systems.

### Conclusion:

Halting global deforestation is essential for tackling the climate crisis, protecting biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development. The United States must leverage its diplomatic influence, trade policy, development assistance, and market power to drive global action. By promoting sustainable land use, eliminating deforestation from supply chains, supporting forest communities, and investing in conservation and restoration, we can help protect the world's vital forest ecosystems for the benefit of all.
