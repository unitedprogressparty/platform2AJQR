## Confronting the Climate Emergency Through International Cooperation and Justice

Climate change represents an existential threat to humanity and the planet, demanding urgent, ambitious, and coordinated global action. The impacts—rising temperatures, extreme weather, sea-level rise, biodiversity loss—are already being felt worldwide, disproportionately affecting vulnerable nations and communities that have contributed least to the crisis. Addressing climate change requires a fundamental transformation of the global energy system, robust adaptation measures, and a commitment to climate justice.

Our platform positions the United States to lead the global response to the climate crisis. We advocate for reasserting U.S. leadership in international climate negotiations, significantly increasing domestic and international climate finance, accelerating the transition to clean energy globally, and supporting vulnerable countries in building resilience.

### Key Strategies for Global Climate Action:

1.  **Strengthen International Climate Agreements:**
    *   Fully commit to and exceed the goals of the Paris Agreement. Advocate for increased ambition from all major emitters in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
    *   Work within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other forums to strengthen international rules for transparency, accountability, and compliance regarding emissions reductions and climate finance.

2.  **Scale Up International Climate Finance:**
    *   Significantly increase U.S. contributions to international climate finance mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Adaptation Fund, to help developing countries mitigate emissions and adapt to climate impacts.
    *   Fulfill and expand upon existing U.S. climate finance pledges, prioritizing grant-based funding for adaptation in the most vulnerable nations (e.g., Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States).
    *   Support initiatives addressing loss and damage associated with unavoidable climate impacts.

3.  **Promote Global Clean Energy Transition:**
    *   Use diplomatic engagement, development assistance, and trade policy to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies worldwide. (See section 4.5 Energy Security).
    *   Support technology transfer and capacity building to help developing countries adopt clean energy solutions.
    *   Work internationally to phase out fossil fuel subsidies globally.

4.  **Address Deforestation and Promote Nature-Based Solutions:**
    *   Lead international efforts to halt deforestation and forest degradation, particularly in tropical regions, through partnerships, sustainable finance, and addressing commodity-driven deforestation. (See section 6.3 Deforestation).
    *   Support international initiatives promoting nature-based climate solutions, such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and sustainable land management, recognizing their dual benefits for climate and biodiversity.

5.  **Integrate Climate Change into All Foreign Policy:**
    *   Ensure climate considerations are integrated across all aspects of U.S. foreign policy, including diplomacy, development, trade, and security strategies.
    *   Appoint high-level climate envoys and ensure climate expertise within the State Department and other relevant agencies.

6.  **Foster Climate Research and Innovation Cooperation:**
    *   Enhance international collaboration on climate science research, monitoring systems, and the development of breakthrough clean energy and carbon removal technologies. (See Domestic Agenda section 3.7).

### Conclusion:

The climate crisis demands unprecedented global cooperation, and the United States has a critical leadership role to play. By strengthening international agreements, mobilizing climate finance, accelerating the clean energy transition, protecting forests, and integrating climate action across our foreign policy, the U.S. can help steer the world towards a safer, more sustainable, and climate-resilient future. Addressing climate change is not only an environmental necessity but also essential for global stability, economic prosperity, and international justice.
