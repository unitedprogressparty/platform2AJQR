## Shifting from a Global War on Drugs to Health-Based Solutions

The international "War on Drugs," largely driven by prohibitionist policies and militarized enforcement, has failed to curb global drug use or supply. Instead, it has fueled violence, corruption, mass incarceration (disproportionately affecting marginalized communities worldwide), instability, and widespread human rights abuses, while undermining public health efforts. A new international approach is needed, one grounded in public health principles, harm reduction, human rights, and sustainable development.

Our platform advocates for U.S. leadership in reforming international drug policy. We must move away from failed prohibitionist strategies and towards policies that prioritize health, reduce harm, respect human rights, target high-level trafficking organizations, and address the root causes of problematic drug use and illicit economies.

### Key Strategies for Reforming International Drug Policy:

1.  **Promote Public Health Approaches and Harm Reduction:**
    *   Advocate within international forums (like the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs) for drug policies centered on public health, harm reduction, and human rights, rather than solely on enforcement and punishment.
    *   Support the global scale-up of evidence-based harm reduction services, such as needle and syringe programs, opioid agonist therapy (like methadone and buprenorphine), overdose prevention (naloxone distribution), and drug checking services.
    *   Support international efforts to decriminalize personal drug possession and use, shifting resources from punishment to voluntary treatment and support services. (See also Domestic Agenda section 6.4.5).

2.  **Focus Enforcement on High-Level Trafficking Organizations:**
    *   Reorient international law enforcement cooperation (with agencies like Interpol, Europol, and bilateral partners) to focus on dismantling large-scale, violent transnational drug trafficking organizations and their financial networks, rather than targeting low-level couriers or users.
    *   Strengthen efforts to combat corruption and money laundering that facilitate the illicit drug trade.

3.  **Support Sustainable Alternative Development:**
    *   Increase U.S. development assistance for sustainable alternative development programs in drug-producing regions, providing viable economic alternatives (e.g., licit crops, ecotourism, small enterprise development) for farmers and communities reliant on illicit cultivation. Ensure these programs are community-led and respect local rights.

4.  **Reform International Drug Control Treaties:**
    *   Engage in efforts to review and potentially modernize the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971, 1988) to better align them with public health, human rights, and sustainable development goals, allowing greater flexibility for national policies like regulation or decriminalization.

5.  **End Support for Abusive Counter-Narcotics Operations:**
    *   Cease U.S. funding and support for foreign counter-narcotics operations or security forces credibly implicated in significant human rights abuses. Ensure all U.S. security assistance includes strict human rights vetting and conditionality.

6.  **Promote Access to Controlled Medicines:**
    *   Work internationally to ensure adequate access to essential controlled medicines (like opioid pain relievers and anesthetics) for legitimate medical purposes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, while maintaining appropriate controls against diversion.

### Conclusion:

The global War on Drugs has failed, causing immense harm worldwide. A new international approach grounded in public health, harm reduction, human rights, and sustainable development is urgently needed. By championing decriminalization, supporting treatment and harm reduction, focusing enforcement on major traffickers, investing in alternative development, and reforming international frameworks, the United States can lead the way towards more humane and effective global drug policies that reduce suffering and promote stability.
