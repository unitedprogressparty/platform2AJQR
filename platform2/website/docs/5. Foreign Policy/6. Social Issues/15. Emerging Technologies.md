## Shaping the Future Responsibly: Global Cooperation on AI, Biotech, and Beyond

Emerging technologies—including Artificial Intelligence (AI), biotechnology (like genetic engineering), advanced computing, nanotechnology, and autonomous systems—are developing at an unprecedented pace, offering transformative potential but also posing profound global challenges. These technologies raise complex ethical questions, have significant implications for international security (e.g., autonomous weapons, AI-enabled cyber threats, biosecurity risks), and could exacerbate global inequalities if not governed responsibly. Effective governance requires international cooperation to establish shared norms, ethical guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.

Our platform advocates for proactive U.S. leadership in fostering international dialogue and cooperation on the governance of emerging technologies. We must work with allies and the global community to ensure these powerful tools are developed and deployed in ways that align with human rights, promote global stability, and ensure benefits are shared equitably.

### Key Strategies for Governing Emerging Technologies Globally:

1.  **Promote International Dialogue and Norm-Setting:**
    *   Actively participate in and lead international forums (e.g., UN bodies, OECD, Global Partnership on AI) dedicated to discussing the ethical, social, economic, and security implications of emerging technologies.
    *   Work towards establishing shared international norms and ethical principles for the development and use of technologies like AI and biotechnology.

2.  **Develop International Frameworks for High-Risk Technologies:**
    *   Pursue verifiable international treaties or agreements to regulate or ban particularly high-risk applications, such as lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) and certain types of gain-of-function research or heritable human germline editing. (See also Domestic Agenda sections 5.4 and 5.6).
    *   Strengthen existing international regimes related to biosecurity (Biological Weapons Convention) and chemical weapons to address risks posed by advances in biotechnology.

3.  **Foster International Scientific Collaboration and Data Sharing:**
    *   Promote international collaboration on research related to the safety, ethics, and societal impacts of emerging technologies.
    *   Encourage open sharing of research data and AI models (where appropriate and safe) to foster global innovation and understanding, while establishing safeguards against misuse.

4.  **Address Global Equity and Access:**
    *   Work to ensure that the benefits of emerging technologies (e.g., AI in healthcare, climate-resilient crops from biotech) are accessible globally, particularly in developing countries.
    *   Support international efforts to bridge the digital divide and build technological capacity worldwide.
    *   Guard against emerging technologies exacerbating existing global inequalities.

5.  **Promote Transparency and Accountability:**
    *   Advocate for international standards promoting transparency in the development and deployment of AI systems, particularly those with significant societal impact.
    *   Support mechanisms for international accountability when emerging technologies are misused or cause transboundary harm.

### Conclusion:

Governing emerging technologies is a complex global challenge that requires foresight, collaboration, and a commitment to ethical principles. By leading international efforts to establish norms, regulate high-risk applications, foster cooperation, promote equity, and ensure transparency, the United States can help steer the development of AI, biotechnology, and other powerful innovations towards a future that benefits all of humanity and mitigates potential catastrophic risks. A proactive, multilateral approach is essential to shaping these transformative technologies responsibly.
