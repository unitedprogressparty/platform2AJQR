## Promoting Self-Determination, Cultural Preservation, and Justice for Indigenous Communities

Indigenous Peoples worldwide possess unique cultures, languages, traditional knowledge, and deep connections to their ancestral lands and territories. Despite their rich heritage, Indigenous communities often face systemic discrimination, marginalization, dispossession of lands and resources, threats to their cultural survival, and disproportionate impacts from environmental degradation and climate change. Upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as affirmed in international instruments like the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), is a matter of human rights, social justice, and environmental stewardship.

Our platform commits the United States to actively promoting and protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples globally through its foreign policy, development assistance, and engagement in international forums. We must support Indigenous self-determination, protect their cultural heritage, ensure their participation in decisions affecting them, and address historical injustices.

### Key Strategies for Upholding Indigenous Rights Globally:

1.  **Support Indigenous Self-Determination and Governance:**
    *   Advocate for the right of Indigenous Peoples to self-determination, including their right to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.
    *   Support Indigenous-led governance structures and initiatives aimed at strengthening their capacity for self-management.

2.  **Uphold Land, Territory, and Resource Rights:**
    *   Promote the recognition and protection of Indigenous Peoples' rights to their traditional lands, territories, and resources, consistent with UNDRIP.
    *   Advocate for processes that ensure Indigenous Peoples' free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) before any projects or policies affecting their lands or resources are approved or implemented.
    *   Support efforts to resolve land disputes and address historical land dispossession through fair and equitable processes.

3.  **Protect Cultural Heritage and Traditional Knowledge:**
    *   Support Indigenous Peoples' efforts to maintain, control, protect, and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and languages.
    *   Advocate for the repatriation of Indigenous cultural property and ancestral remains.
    *   Ensure intellectual property rules respect and protect Indigenous traditional knowledge. (See section 4.8).

4.  **Ensure Participation in Decision-Making:**
    *   Promote the effective participation of Indigenous Peoples in all matters that concern them at the local, national, and international levels, including in environmental governance, development planning, and climate action.
    *   Support Indigenous representation in international forums.

5.  **Address Violence and Discrimination:**
    *   Speak out against and work to end violence, discrimination, and human rights abuses targeting Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous human rights defenders.
    *   Support access to justice for Indigenous Peoples and accountability for violations of their rights.

6.  **Integrate Indigenous Rights into Development and Climate Policy:**
    *   Ensure that U.S. development assistance programs respect Indigenous rights and support Indigenous-led development priorities.
    *   Recognize the vital role of Indigenous Peoples and their traditional knowledge in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and ensure their participation in climate policy processes. (See section 6.1).

7.  **Domestic Example:**
    *   Strengthen the U.S. government's own relationship with Native American tribal nations based on respect for sovereignty and treaty rights, serving as a positive example internationally. (See Domestic Agenda section 4.5).

### Conclusion:

Upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples is essential for achieving global justice, equity, and sustainability. By supporting their self-determination, protecting their lands and cultures, ensuring their participation, and addressing violence and discrimination, the United States can champion the rights of Indigenous communities worldwide. This commitment aligns with universal human rights principles and contributes to building a more inclusive and just global order.
