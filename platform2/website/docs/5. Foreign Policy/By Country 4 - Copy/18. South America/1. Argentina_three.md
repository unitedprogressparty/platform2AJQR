---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Argentina has evolved significantly over the years, marked by both cooperation and tension. Recently, under the presidency of Alberto Fernández, Argentina has sought to strengthen its ties with the U.S., particularly in light of economic challenges and the need for foreign investment. The Biden administration has expressed interest in working together on issues such as climate change, trade, and regional security. However, there are underlying tensions due to Argentina's historical ties with countries like China and Russia, as well as its complex relationship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The U.S. aims to ensure that Argentina remains aligned with democratic values and market-oriented reforms while addressing its economic difficulties.

### **Crises**:

Argentina currently faces significant economic instability, characterized by high inflation rates, currency depreciation, and rising poverty levels. The country is grappling with a heavy debt burden, which has led to negotiations with the IMF for financial assistance. This economic crisis has the potential to escalate into social unrest, as citizens express frustration over austerity measures and declining living standards. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, with vulnerable populations bearing the brunt of the health and economic impacts.

Moreover, the political landscape in Argentina remains fragile, with internal divisions and the rise of populist movements posing challenges to governance. There are concerns about the potential for increased political polarization, which could lead to protests and civil unrest. The upcoming elections in 2023 may further complicate the situation, as candidates present differing approaches to addressing the country's economic woes.

Regionally, Argentina's relationship with neighboring countries also plays a crucial role in shaping its crisis dynamics. The rise of authoritarian regimes in the region raises concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and human rights. The U.S. must navigate this complex landscape, supporting Argentina in its efforts to uphold democratic values while addressing security threats posed by regional instability.

Looking ahead, the potential for violence from organized crime, particularly in urban areas, poses a significant threat to social cohesion and stability. The U.S. has an opportunity to collaborate with Argentina on security initiatives, focusing on combating drug trafficking and enhancing law enforcement capabilities. By fostering cooperation in these areas, both countries can work towards a more stable and secure region.

**Frank Narrative**

The United States has a vested interest in ensuring that Argentina remains a stable democracy in South America. Historically, Argentina has been a key player in regional organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). The U.S. can benefit from Argentina's involvement in promoting democratic governance, human rights, and economic stability in the region. By supporting Argentina's efforts to strengthen its democratic institutions, the U.S. can help mitigate the influence of authoritarian regimes and promote a more stable geopolitical environment.

Furthermore, Argentina's strategic location and resources make it a valuable partner for the U.S. in addressing global challenges such as climate change and food security. The U.S. can collaborate with Argentina on renewable energy initiatives, leveraging its vast agricultural sector to promote sustainable practices. By investing in Argentina's green economy, the U.S. can foster economic growth while addressing the urgent challenges posed by climate change.

In terms of security, Argentina faces threats from organized crime and drug trafficking, which have implications for regional stability. The U.S. can support Argentina's efforts to combat these issues through intelligence sharing and capacity building for law enforcement agencies. By working together to address these security challenges, both countries can enhance their partnership while promoting stability in South America.

Looking to the future, the U.S. should prioritize economic cooperation with Argentina, focusing on trade and investment opportunities. By fostering a conducive environment for U.S. businesses to operate in Argentina, the U.S. can help stimulate economic growth and job creation. This economic partnership can also serve as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in the region, ensuring that Argentina remains aligned with democratic values and market-oriented reforms.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Argentina has historically been a partner in U.S. strategic interests, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism and energy security. The country has cooperated with the U.S. on intelligence sharing and joint military exercises aimed at combating terrorism in the region. Furthermore, Argentina's vast natural resources, including lithium and agricultural products, are vital for U.S. industries, particularly in the context of the transition to renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

Moving forward, the U.S. would like Argentina to continue its commitment to democratic governance and human rights while enhancing its role in regional security initiatives. Strengthening cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts and combating organized crime will be essential for maintaining stability in both nations. Additionally, as Argentina seeks to diversify its economy and attract foreign investment, the U.S. hopes to facilitate trade agreements that promote mutual economic growth.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Argentina requires substantial support from the U.S. and the international community to address its economic challenges. Assistance in the form of financial aid, investment in infrastructure, and access to technology will be critical for Argentina's recovery and economic diversification. Specifically, the U.S. can help by providing technical assistance for agricultural modernization, fostering innovation, and promoting sustainable practices in key sectors.

Moreover, Argentina seeks to establish stronger trade relations with the U.S. to boost its exports and create jobs. U.S. support in negotiating favorable trade agreements would help Argentina regain access to international markets. Strengthening these economic ties can also enhance Argentina's resilience against external shocks and support its long-term development goals.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Argentina is the second-largest country in South America, bordered by the Andes Mountains to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. It has a diverse population of approximately 45 million people, with a rich cultural heritage influenced by European immigration. Argentina operates as a federal republic, with a president serving as both the head of state and government. The country's GDP is approximately $450 billion, making it one of the largest economies in Latin America. However, Argentina has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation rates, which recently reached over 50%, and a poverty rate exceeding 30%. The quality of life varies significantly across the country, with urban areas like Buenos Aires offering better access to services than rural regions. According to the Freedom House index, Argentina ranks as "partly free," with concerns regarding political polarization and freedom of the press.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Argentina's geographic location and natural resources position it as a critical player in regional and global stability. The country is a major exporter of agricultural products, including soybeans, beef, and wine, which are essential for global food security. Additionally, Argentina possesses significant reserves of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles. As the U.S. transitions towards renewable energy, Argentina's role in supplying these resources becomes increasingly important. Furthermore, Argentina's commitment to democratic governance serves as a counterbalance to authoritarianism in the region, aligning with U.S. interests in promoting democracy and human rights.

**Democracy Score:**

Argentina's political landscape is characterized by a multi-party system, with the ruling party currently being the Frente de Todos coalition, led by President Alberto Fernández. The government has faced challenges in implementing necessary reforms due to political polarization and opposition from various sectors. While Argentina has a long history of democratic governance, recent events have raised concerns about the erosion of democratic norms, particularly related to freedom of the press and civil liberties. The country's governance practices are often influenced by populist sentiments, which can undermine institutional stability. Comparatively, Argentina's official structures demonstrate a commitment to democracy, but real-world political dynamics reveal challenges in governance and public trust.

**Historical Context:**

* **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S.-Argentina relationship has seen significant milestones, including the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1852 and Argentina's alignment with the U.S. during the Cold War. The 1990s witnessed increased economic cooperation, with the signing of the U.S.-Argentina Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 1991. However, the relationship faced challenges during the Kirchner administrations (2003-2015), characterized by a more confrontational stance towards the U.S. More recently, the election of President Alberto Fernández in 2019 marked a potential shift towards renewed engagement with the U.S.

* **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Throughout history, Argentina has been a partner in various agreements related to trade, security, and cultural exchange. The U.S. and Argentina have collaborated on counterterrorism efforts, narcotics control, and military training exercises. However, tensions arose during the Kirchner era, particularly regarding human rights issues and Argentina's foreign policy alignment with countries such as Venezuela and China. The current administration seeks to rebuild relations and address mutual concerns, albeit with a cautious approach that considers Argentina's domestic challenges.
