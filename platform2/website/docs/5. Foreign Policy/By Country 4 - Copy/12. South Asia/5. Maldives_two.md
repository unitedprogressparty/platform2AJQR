**Maldives: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### Preface

The Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, known for its stunning natural beauty and vibrant marine life. In recent years, the relationship between the United States and the Maldives has evolved, particularly with the election of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in 2018, who has emphasized strengthening ties with the U.S. and other democratic nations. Recent events, including the Maldivesâ€™ decision to embrace a more democratic governance structure and its efforts to combat climate change, have opened avenues for greater collaboration. However, challenges remain, including the rise of political instability and the impacts of climate change on the Maldivian economy and society.

### Crises:

The Maldives currently faces several crises that could impact its stability and relationship with the U.S. The most pressing issue is the ongoing threat of climate change, which poses significant risks to its low-lying islands, threatening to displace populations and disrupt its tourism-dependent economy. Additionally, there are concerns regarding political polarization and the potential for civil unrest, particularly as the country approaches its next elections. The region also grapples with external pressures from larger powers, such as China, which has increased its influence in the Indian Ocean, raising questions about the Maldives' strategic alignment.

In the past, the Maldives has dealt with crises related to political repression and authoritarian governance, particularly under former President Abdulla Yameen, whose policies led to widespread human rights abuses and strained relations with the U.S. However, the election of President Solih has marked a shift towards democratic governance, although the potential for backlash from pro-Yameen supporters poses a risk for future stability. The country also faces social unrest related to economic disparities and youth unemployment, which could lead to increased tensions.

Looking ahead, the Maldives anticipates crises stemming from economic challenges, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted tourism and related sectors. The nation has also seen a rise in extremist ideologies and radicalization among its youth, presenting a potential threat to internal security and regional stability. Furthermore, as climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, the Maldives may find itself in a precarious position, necessitating increased international support and cooperation.

### Frank Narrative

The Maldives, as a small island nation, has significant strategic importance to the United States, particularly in the context of the Indo-Pacific region. Historically, the Maldives has served as a vital link in maritime trade routes and a strategic location for monitoring naval activities in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. has an interest in ensuring that this region remains free from undue influence by adversarial powers, particularly China, which has been expanding its footprint in the Indian Ocean through investment and development projects. As such, the Maldives can play a crucial role in supporting U.S. initiatives aimed at maintaining maritime security and fostering democratic governance.

Moreover, the Maldives can aid the U.S. in addressing climate change through collaborative efforts in environmental protection and sustainable tourism. Given the Maldives' vulnerability to rising sea levels, the U.S. has an opportunity to partner with the Maldives in promoting renewable energy initiatives and climate resilience strategies. By supporting the Maldives in these efforts, the U.S. can further its own goals of combating global warming and promoting sustainable development practices in vulnerable regions.

In return, the Maldives requires support from the U.S. in various domains, particularly in economic diversification and strengthening democratic institutions. As the nation seeks to reduce its dependence on tourism, U.S. investment in alternative sectors such as fisheries and technology can help bolster economic stability. Additionally, assistance in building robust governance frameworks and promoting human rights will be essential for ensuring long-term political stability and fostering a democratic culture within the Maldives.

The current political landscape in the Maldives presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S. foreign policy. With the recent shift towards democratic governance, the U.S. has the potential to influence positive reforms and reinforce democratic values. However, rising political tensions and the potential for violence from political factions pose risks that must be carefully managed. The U.S. can play a mediating role in encouraging dialogue and reconciliation among political groups, thus contributing to a more stable and democratic Maldives.

### 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

The Maldives is an archipelago consisting of 26 atolls located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Sri Lanka. It has a population of approximately 540,000 people and is known for its democratic government, though challenges to its democratic processes remain. The Maldives has a GDP of around $5.7 billion, heavily reliant on tourism, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue. The quality of life in the Maldives is notable, but there are disparities in access to services and opportunities. The Freedom Index scores indicate moderate levels of political freedom, although concerns about human rights and governance persist.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

The Maldives' strategic location along key maritime routes in the Indian Ocean makes it significant for global shipping and trade. Its proximity to major Indian and Chinese naval activities further enhances its importance in regional security dynamics. The Maldives has also been a participant in international discussions on climate change, emphasizing the need for global action to address the existential threat posed by rising sea levels.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in the Maldives has seen significant changes, particularly since the election of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who leads the Maldivian Democratic Party. While the Maldives has made strides towards democratic governance, issues such as political corruption, limited press freedom, and the influence of former authoritarian leaders remain problematic. The current government is working to strengthen democratic institutions, but the challenges of political polarization and potential opposition from pro-Yameen factions complicate the situation.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
The relationship between the U.S. and the Maldives has evolved over the years, with significant milestones including the U.S. support for the democratic transition in 2008 and the condemnation of human rights abuses under former President Yameen. In 2019, President Solih's administration emphasized strengthening ties with the U.S. as part of its foreign policy agenda, marking a turning point in bilateral relations.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
The Maldives has engaged in various partnerships with the U.S., particularly in the areas of counterterrorism and maritime security. However, the previous administration's authoritarian policies led to strained relations and a decrease in cooperation. Currently, the U.S. is working to rebuild these ties through diplomatic engagement and support for democratic reforms.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

The Maldives requires support from the U.S. to address domestic challenges such as economic diversification and building resilient governance structures. U.S. assistance in these areas will be instrumental in ensuring long-term stability and sustainable development.

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

To move forward, the U.S. should propose a comprehensive partnership plan that includes economic investment in sustainable sectors, support for democratic governance, and collaborative efforts in climate change adaptation. This plan should outline specific initiatives and funding mechanisms to achieve shared goals.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

Strengthening alliances with the Maldives and managing relationships with larger regional powers will be essential. The U.S. should promote democratic values, human rights, and good governance as part of its diplomatic strategy.
