**Dominica: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Dominica, known as the Nature Island of the Caribbean, has a unique relationship with the United States characterized by cooperation in various sectors, including climate resilience, disaster recovery, and economic development. Recent events, such as Dominica's recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017, have prompted the U.S. to support the island's rebuilding efforts and enhance its resilience to climate change. The United States remains interested in Dominica as a strategic partner in the Caribbean region, particularly regarding countering the influence of other nations and ensuring regional stability.

### **Crises:**

Dominica currently faces several challenges, including the impacts of climate change, which have made the island susceptible to natural disasters. The aftermath of Hurricane Maria highlighted vulnerabilities in infrastructure, housing, and emergency preparedness. The country continues to recover and build resilience against future storms, with ongoing support from international partners, including the U.S. Additionally, the region is experiencing political unrest in some neighboring countries, which could spill over into Dominica, posing risks to its stability and security.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also strained Dominica's economy, primarily reliant on tourism and agriculture. Although the island has managed to keep infection rates relatively low, economic repercussions are still being felt, necessitating assistance in economic diversification and job creation. 

Looking toward the future, there are potential risks from increasing regional competition for influence, particularly from China, which has been investing in Caribbean nations. Dominica must navigate these relationships carefully while maintaining its ties with the U.S. 

Violence from criminal organizations in the region remains a concern, as well, with the potential for gangs and trafficking networks to disrupt peace and security. Therefore, the U.S. must remain engaged and supportive to help mitigate these risks and bolster Dominica's security apparatus.

**Frank Narrative**

The United States sees Dominica as a vital partner in the Caribbean, primarily due to its strategic location and commitment to democratic governance. Over the past few years, Dominica has made significant strides in enhancing its democratic institutions, which aligns with U.S. interests in promoting stability and democracy in the region. Recent cooperation in disaster recovery and climate adaptation has underscored the importance of U.S. engagement in Dominica, showcasing the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dominica's commitment to environmental sustainability, particularly as it rebuilds from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, presents an opportunity for the U.S. to assist in developing renewable energy sources and enhancing climate resilience. The island's focus on becoming the world's first climate-resilient nation aligns with U.S. interests in combating climate change and fostering sustainable development. The U.S. can support these efforts through technological assistance and investments in green infrastructure.

Moreover, the increasing presence of non-traditional actors in the Caribbean, particularly China's growing influence through infrastructure projects and investments, necessitates a strategic approach by the U.S. to reinforce its relationships in the region. Dominica can play a pivotal role in countering this influence while promoting democratic values and human rights, which remain central to U.S. foreign policy objectives.

In the coming years, the U.S. should prioritize engagement with Dominica to promote economic diversification, enhance security cooperation, and support democratic governance. By addressing these areas, both nations can benefit from a stronger partnership that fosters regional stability and resilience against emerging threats.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Dominica has historically contributed to U.S. strategic interests through its commitment to democratic governance and regional stability. As a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Dominica can assist in facilitating cooperation among Caribbean nations to promote collective security and economic development. 

In the future, the U.S. would like Dominica to continue advocating for democratic principles and human rights within regional organizations, as well as to participate in joint initiatives focusing on climate resilience and disaster preparedness. Furthermore, Dominica's role in countering transnational crime through regional collaborations could help address security threats that affect both nations.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Dominica requires support in several areas to address its domestic challenges. Economic diversification is critical, as reliance on tourism and agriculture makes the island vulnerable to external shocks, such as natural disasters and global economic downturns. The U.S. can assist by promoting trade agreements and encouraging investment in emerging industries, such as technology and renewable energy.

Additionally, Dominica needs support in enhancing its public health infrastructure and emergency preparedness systems, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collaboration on public health initiatives and access to vaccines can help strengthen the island's health security.
