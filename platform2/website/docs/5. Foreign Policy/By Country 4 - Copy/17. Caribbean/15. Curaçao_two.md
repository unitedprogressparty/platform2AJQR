# **Curaçao: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Curaçao, a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, maintain a cooperative relationship focused primarily on regional security, particularly counter-narcotics, and economic ties. Located in the southern Caribbean near Venezuela, Curaçao plays a significant role in U.S. regional security strategy by hosting a **U.S. Forward Operating Location (FOL)** at its airport, which supports aerial counter-narcotics surveillance missions across the region. As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Curaçao's foreign and defense policies are ultimately Kingdom responsibilities, but it possesses autonomy in most other affairs. Current relations are **positive and centered on security cooperation and economic links**, including tourism and financial services. The U.S. values Curaçao's stability, democratic governance, and its crucial role in supporting regional counter-drug efforts via the FOL.

### **Crises**

Curaçao faces several ongoing challenges, mainly economic and related to regional spillovers. The **collapse of Venezuela's economy and political crisis** has significantly impacted Curaçao, historically a close economic partner (especially via its large oil refinery, now mostly inactive). The primary manifestation is **irregular migration flows** from Venezuela, straining Curaçao's resources and social services as a small island nation. Managing these flows humanely and securely is a major challenge. The instability in Venezuela also increases risks related to **transnational crime**, including drug trafficking and smuggling in the waters around Curaçao.

Economically, Curaçao faces challenges in **diversifying its economy** beyond tourism, financial services, and the historically important (but now largely defunct) oil refinery. It needs sustainable economic growth to address unemployment and provide opportunities for its population. Like other islands, it is vulnerable to **external economic shocks** affecting tourism or global trade.

Environmentally, Curaçao is vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, including sea-level rise, coral reef degradation, potential changes in storm patterns, and water scarcity (relying on desalination). Protecting its marine environment, crucial for tourism and fisheries, is an ongoing challenge.

Anticipated future crises could include a significant escalation of the **Venezuelan crisis** leading to larger migration surges or increased regional instability. **Economic downturns** impacting tourism or challenges in revitalizing/repurposing the refinery site could create hardship. **Climate change impacts** could worsen over time, threatening coastal areas and water supplies. Maintaining political stability and effective governance while managing these pressures is key.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Curaçao provides a critical contribution to U.S. regional security goals, primarily by **hosting the U.S. Forward Operating Location (FOL)** at Hato International Airport. Under an agreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this FOL enables U.S. and partner nation aircraft to conduct counter-narcotics surveillance and monitoring operations over the Caribbean basin and South America, directly supporting U.S. efforts to stem the flow of illicit drugs towards the United States. This longstanding cooperation (FOL established in 2000) makes Curaçao a vital node in the U.S. regional counter-drug architecture. Beyond the FOL, Curaçao cooperates with U.S. law enforcement agencies (DEA, Coast Guard, CBP) on **counter-narcotics interdiction** and combating **transnational crime**, leveraging its strategic location near trafficking routes. It participates in regional security mechanisms, often facilitated by the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. As a stable democracy with strong rule of law within the Dutch Kingdom, Curaçao contributes to overall **Caribbean stability**. Its well-regulated **financial services sector** (though needing continuous AML vigilance) and **logistics hub potential** (deepwater port, dry dock) can also support legitimate regional economic activity.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Curaçao's continued reliable **hosting and support for the FOL**, ensuring its effective operation for regional counter-narcotics surveillance. Deepened cooperation on **maritime security and counter-narcotics interdiction**, including enhanced information sharing and potentially joint operations involving the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard and U.S. assets, is desired. Continued effective management of **migration flows** from Venezuela, in coordination with regional partners and international organizations (UNHCR, IOM), is important for regional stability. Strengthening **anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) frameworks** within its financial sector is crucial for preventing illicit finance. Concrete actions could include Curaçao (via the Kingdom) investing in infrastructure supporting the FOL, enhancing its own maritime surveillance capabilities, and proactively sharing intelligence on illicit activities. Accountability is maintained through the U.S.-Kingdom of Netherlands agreements governing the FOL and defense cooperation, bilateral law enforcement dialogues, and regional security forums.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Curaçao's needs from the U.S. and the international community center on security cooperation, economic development support, and assistance in managing regional challenges. A primary need is continued **U.S. and international partnership in combating transnational crime**, particularly narcotics trafficking that transits near its waters. This includes intelligence sharing, technical assistance, training for local law enforcement and the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard, and operational support for interdiction efforts (e.g., via JIATF-South).

Curaçao requires significant international support, including from the U.S. and the Netherlands/EU, to manage the **humanitarian and socioeconomic impacts of Venezuelan migration**. This includes funding for UNHCR/IOM and local NGOs providing assistance to migrants/refugees, technical support for developing asylum and migration management systems, and diplomatic efforts addressing the root causes of the crisis in Venezuela.

Economically, Curaçao needs support for **economic diversification** to reduce reliance on tourism, the financial sector, and the uncertain future of the oil refinery. This could involve technical assistance for developing new industries (e.g., logistics, ship repair, renewable energy, potentially tech services), promoting foreign investment (including from the U.S. via DFC if projects qualify), and support for workforce development/education aligned with diversification goals. Continued access for its limited exports to regional and international markets is also important.

Given its environmental vulnerabilities, Curaçao needs access to international **climate finance and technology** for **climate change adaptation** (coastal protection, water management) and developing **renewable energy** sources (solar, wind potential). U.S. support via regional climate initiatives or technical expertise could be beneficial. Finally, Curaçao benefits from continued **U.S. engagement** that recognizes its strategic importance (especially the FOL) and supports its stability and democratic governance within the Kingdom of the Netherlands framework.
