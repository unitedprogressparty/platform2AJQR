**Cuba: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The relationship between the United States and Cuba has been historically fraught, marked by ideological differences and conflicting political systems. Recently, this relationship has seen a cautious thaw, particularly in light of the Biden administration's approach to re-engagement with Havana, focusing on humanitarian aid and re-establishing some diplomatic ties that were strained during the Trump administration. Recent events have included discussions on remittances, travel restrictions, and shared interests in public health initiatives, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Cuba continues to face internal challenges, including a struggling economy exacerbated by U.S. sanctions, food shortages, and a need for broader economic reforms.

### **Crises**:

Cuba is currently grappling with significant crises, both socio-economic and political. The nation is experiencing severe economic difficulties, with inflation rates soaring and food shortages becoming increasingly common. These challenges have led to widespread public discontent, manifesting in protests across the country, particularly in July 2021 when thousands took to the streets demanding political reform and better living conditions. The Cuban government responded with crackdowns on dissent, which have raised concerns about human rights violations. 

In addition to economic crises, Cuba faces the challenge of managing its healthcare system in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Cuba has developed its own vaccines, the pandemic has strained the healthcare system and highlighted the need for international cooperation in health initiatives. The dual pressures of economic collapse and health crises could potentially lead to increased instability and unrest within the country.

Regionally, Cuba's relationships with other Latin American nations also influence its ability to navigate current crises. The rise of leftist governments in the region offers opportunities for solidarity and support, but it also raises concerns among U.S. policymakers, who view such alliances as potential threats to regional stability. The implications of these alliances and Cuba's historical ties to countries like Venezuela remain significant considerations for U.S. foreign policy.

Looking ahead, the potential for future crises in Cuba is compounded by the risk of internal violence should public discontent continue to escalate. The governmentâ€™s repressive measures against dissent could provoke further unrest, leading to a volatile situation that may necessitate U.S. engagement to prevent humanitarian disasters or mass migrations.

**Frank Narrative**

Cuba's role in the Caribbean and Latin America is pivotal for U.S. strategic interests, particularly in the realms of counterterrorism and regional stability. Historically, Cuba has been a focal point for U.S. policy in Latin America, with its alliances with nations such as Venezuela and Bolivia presenting challenges for U.S. influence in the region. However, Cuba has also demonstrated an ability to assist in humanitarian initiatives, including sending medical professionals abroad, which aligns with U.S. interests in promoting global health.

The United States desires Cuba's cooperation on various fronts, particularly in countering the influence of authoritarian regimes in Latin America. By fostering dialogue and economic incentives, the U.S. can encourage Cuba to pursue reforms that align with democratic values and human rights. Furthermore, the U.S. would benefit from Cuba's participation in multilateral initiatives aimed at addressing challenges such as migration and regional security.

Cuba, in turn, seeks relief from the economic sanctions imposed by the United States, which have significantly hampered its economy. The Cuban government expects the U.S. to recognize its sovereignty and contribute to lifting restrictions that limit its access to international markets and resources. Such cooperation could lead to increased investment in Cuba, promoting economic recovery and stability, which benefits both nations.

Looking to the future, the U.S. should emphasize multilateral approaches to engage Cuba effectively. By working through regional organizations and fostering partnerships, the U.S. can facilitate Cuba's integration into the global economy while ensuring that its human rights practices align with international standards. This cooperative engagement can serve to stabilize the region and reduce the likelihood of crises that could have broader implications for U.S. interests.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Cuba has historically contributed to U.S. strategic interests through its partnerships in public health, particularly in the training and deployment of medical professionals to other countries. This contribution has been significant in areas such as disaster relief and epidemic response, aligning with U.S. goals of promoting health security in the region. In the future, the U.S. would like Cuba to expand its participation in international health initiatives and cooperate on issues related to climate change, given Cuba's vulnerability to natural disasters.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Cuba requires support for economic diversification and recovery from the crippling effects of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. could assist by providing technological assistance to modernize its infrastructure and improve agricultural production, which is critical for food security. Additionally, Cuba seeks investment in renewable energy projects, which could reduce its dependence on imported oil and stimulate economic growth. 

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Cuba is an island nation located in the Caribbean, south of the United States and east of Mexico. It has a population of approximately 11 million people, with Havana as its capital. The country operates under a single-party socialist system, led by the Communist Party of Cuba. Cuba's GDP is approximately $100 billion, with a significant portion of its economy reliant on tourism, healthcare, and biotechnology. However, the country struggles with low quality of life indicators and limited political freedoms, ranking poorly on the Freedom Index.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Cuba's strategic location makes it a critical player in regional security dynamics. Its proximity to the U.S. and control over significant shipping lanes impacts trade routes and military considerations. Additionally, Cuba's role in the Caribbean as a counterbalance to U.S. influence and its alliances with other leftist governments in Latin America can either bolster or challenge U.S. strategic objectives.

**Democracy Score:**

Cuba's political landscape is characterized by a lack of democratic freedoms, with the Communist Party maintaining strict control over governance and civil society. The ruling party suppresses dissent, limiting political pluralism and freedom of expression. While there have been recent calls for reform, the government's response has been repressive, leading to a climate of fear and resistance among citizens.

**Historical Context:**

  - 1961: The U.S. imposed a trade embargo on Cuba following the Cuban Revolution.
  - 2014: The Obama administration initiated a thaw in relations, leading to the re-establishment of diplomatic ties.
