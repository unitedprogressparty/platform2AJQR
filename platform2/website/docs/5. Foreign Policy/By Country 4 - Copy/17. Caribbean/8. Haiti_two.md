# **Haiti: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Haiti share a complex and often difficult relationship, shaped by geographic proximity, deep historical ties (Haiti being the second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere), a large Haitian diaspora in the U.S., and decades of U.S. political, economic, and humanitarian engagement. Haiti faces profound, overlapping crises, including extreme political instability, rampant gang violence controlling large parts of the capital, a collapsed economy, deep poverty, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The U.S. remains Haiti's largest international donor and partner, providing substantial humanitarian aid, development assistance, and support for the Haitian National Police (HNP). Current relations are dominated by the **acute security and political crisis** following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 and the subsequent breakdown of state authority. The U.S. is focused on supporting efforts to restore security (including backing a Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support - MSS mission), facilitating a political transition towards elections, addressing dire humanitarian needs, and interdicting irregular migration flows. The relationship is **crisis-driven and focused on stabilization**, with the U.S. working through international partners (UN, CARICOM) and Haitian stakeholders to find a path towards restoring order and legitimate governance.

### **Crises**

Haiti is engulfed in multiple, severe, and interconnected crises, representing one of the most challenging situations in the Western Hemisphere. The most acute is the **security crisis**, characterized by powerful, heavily armed gangs controlling significant portions of Port-au-Prince and other areas. These gangs engage in widespread violence, including killings, kidnappings for ransom, extortion, and sexual violence, terrorizing the population and crippling economic activity. The Haitian National Police (HNP) is overwhelmed, under-resourced, and outgunned, unable to establish control. This violence has displaced hundreds of thousands internally and severely restricted access for humanitarian aid delivery.

This security breakdown is intertwined with a profound **political crisis**. Following President Moïse's assassination in July 2021, Haiti has lacked a functioning elected government. Prime Minister Ariel Henry led an unelected transitional government until intense gang pressure forced his resignation announcement in March 2024 while he was outside the country. Efforts brokered by CARICOM and supported by the U.S. led to the formation of a Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) in April 2024, tasked with appointing an interim prime minister and paving the way for elections, but its ability to establish authority and govern effectively amidst the violence remains highly uncertain. The country suffers from a near-total collapse of state institutions.

These crises unfold against a backdrop of a dire **humanitarian crisis**. Nearly half the population faces acute food insecurity. Access to basic services like healthcare, clean water, and education has deteriorated sharply due to violence and state collapse. Cholera outbreaks have re-emerged. The violence prevents many Haitians from working or accessing markets, deepening poverty.

Economically, Haiti faces a **profound economic crisis**, with years of negative growth, high inflation, and extreme poverty (the vast majority live below the poverty line). The security situation has paralyzed much of the formal economy. Furthermore, Haiti remains extremely **vulnerable to natural disasters** (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods), which repeatedly devastate infrastructure and livelihoods, compounding existing crises. The 2010 earthquake killed hundreds of thousands, and subsequent disasters (Hurricane Matthew 2016, 2021 earthquake) have caused significant damage and loss of life.

Anticipated future crises include the potential failure of the TPC to establish legitimacy or organize elections, leading to prolonged political vacuum or fragmentation. The security situation could worsen further if the MSS mission fails to deploy effectively or becomes bogged down. The humanitarian situation is likely to remain critical, potentially tipping into famine in some areas if aid access does not improve. Continued economic collapse and lack of opportunity will likely fuel further **irregular migration** towards the U.S. and neighboring countries. The upcoming hurricane season poses an immediate threat of further disaster. Long-term recovery requires addressing deep-rooted issues of governance, corruption, impunity, and lack of economic opportunity, alongside restoring basic security.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Given Haiti's profound internal crises, its capacity to actively help the U.S. achieve broader regional goals is currently extremely limited. U.S. goals *in* Haiti primarily focus on stabilization, humanitarian relief, and preventing the country's collapse from further destabilizing the Caribbean region. Historically, during periods of relative stability, Haiti has participated in regional forums like CARICOM (joining in 2002) and the Organization of American States (OAS), contributing modestly to regional diplomatic discussions. Haitian diaspora communities in the U.S. contribute culturally and economically to American society. In the past, Haiti has cooperated with the U.S. on specific issues like counter-narcotics interdiction, given its location along trafficking routes.

Looking forward, a **stabilized and eventually recovering Haiti** could contribute to U.S. regional goals primarily by **ceasing to be a source of instability and irregular migration**. A Haiti with restored security, functioning democratic institutions, and improved economic conditions would reduce pressures on neighboring countries (like the Dominican Republic and the U.S. itself) related to migration flows and transnational crime. A stable Haiti could eventually resume more active participation in **CARICOM** and **OAS**, contributing to regional cooperation on shared challenges like climate change, health security, and disaster response. Re-establishing effective state control could allow for renewed cooperation on **counter-narcotics** and **maritime security**. In the very long term, a recovering Haitian economy could offer modest trade and investment opportunities. However, the immediate U.S. objective is not leveraging Haiti for broader regional goals, but rather helping Haiti achieve a baseline level of security, governance, and human well-being that prevents it from further destabilizing the immediate region and generating large-scale outward migration. Accountability for any future contributions would first require the establishment of a legitimate, functioning Haitian government capable of engaging internationally.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Haiti's needs from the U.S. and the international community are immense, urgent, and span across security, political, humanitarian, and development spheres. The most immediate and critical need is **support for restoring basic security**. This includes robust international backing – financial, logistical, intelligence, and political – for the **Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission** authorized by the UN Security Council and intended to be led by Kenya. The U.S. is the primary financial backer ($300 million pledged) and needs to ensure timely disbursement and coordinate international contributions. Simultaneously, continued support (funding, equipment, training, vetting) for the **Haitian National Police (HNP)** is essential to build its capacity to maintain order alongside and eventually independently of the MSS. Benchmarks include deployment of the MSS, measurable reduction in gang violence/control, and improved HNP operational effectiveness and human rights compliance.

Politically, Haiti needs sustained and coordinated **international diplomatic support for the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC)** and the broader political transition process. This involves U.S. engagement working in concert with CARICOM, the UN (BINUH mission), OAS, and other key partners to help Haitian stakeholders agree on an interim government, develop a roadmap for credible elections, and begin rebuilding state institutions. Technical and financial assistance will be needed for organizing elections when security conditions permit. Support for Haitian-led dialogue processes aimed at building national consensus is crucial. Success metrics include appointment of an interim government, progress on constitutional reform (if pursued), and eventual holding of free and fair elections.

Addressing the **dire humanitarian crisis** is an urgent need. Haiti requires substantial and sustained international humanitarian aid – food, water, medical supplies, shelter – delivered through UN agencies (like WFP, UNICEF, WHO) and international/local NGOs. Ensuring safe and unimpeded **humanitarian access** amidst the insecurity is paramount, requiring coordination between humanitarian actors, the MSS (once deployed), and potentially dialogue with armed groups where necessary. The U.S. must continue its role as the leading humanitarian donor and encourage other nations to contribute generously. Benchmarks include levels of aid delivered, populations reached, and improvements in food security and health indicators.

For long-term recovery, Haiti needs massive and sustained **development assistance** focused on addressing the root causes of instability. This includes investments in **poverty reduction**, job creation (especially for youth), **agriculture** (improving food security), basic **infrastructure** (energy, water, sanitation, roads), **health** systems strengthening, and **education**. U.S. assistance via USAID should prioritize these areas, coordinating closely with other donors (World Bank, IDB, EU, Canada) to ensure effectiveness and avoid duplication. Programs promoting **good governance, anti-corruption, and rule of law** are essential foundations for sustainable development. Support for **climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction** is also critical given Haiti's extreme vulnerability. Success requires long-term commitment measured by improvements in human development indices, poverty rates, and institutional capacity.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Republic of Haiti occupies the western third of the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Its geography is largely mountainous, with coastal plains. Population is estimated around **11.7 million** (2023).
- Haiti is nominally a **semi-presidential republic**, but currently lacks a functioning elected government and is undergoing a complex political transition managed by a Transitional Presidential Council, following the 2021 assassination of President Moïse. State institutions have largely collapsed amidst widespread gang control.
- Economically, Haiti is the **poorest country in the Western Hemisphere** and one of the poorest in the world (LDC status). GDP is roughly **$20 billion** (though shrinking). GDP per capita is extremely low, around **$1,700**. The economy is characterized by extreme poverty, high unemployment, reliance on subsistence agriculture, remittances from the diaspora, and international aid. The formal economy has been severely crippled by insecurity.
- Quality of life indicators are dire. Life expectancy is around **64 years**. Access to basic services (healthcare, education, water, sanitation, electricity) is extremely limited and has worsened with the current crisis. Food insecurity is rampant.
- Freedom House ranks Haiti as **“Not Free”** (score typically around 30/100, likely lower now), reflecting the collapse of democratic institutions, extreme violence, lack of rule of law, and pervasive corruption.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Haiti's primary importance to U.S. interests stems from its **geographic proximity** (potential for instability spillover, irregular migration, illicit trafficking) and the large **Haitian diaspora** in the U.S. (over 1 million).
- Preventing state collapse, addressing the humanitarian crisis, and restoring stability are key U.S. priorities to avoid further regional destabilization and large-scale migration flows towards the U.S.
- Supporting a return to democratic governance aligns with U.S. values and regional policy goals.
- Cooperation on counter-narcotics is relevant due to Haiti's location.

**Democracy Score:**

- Haiti currently lacks a functioning democracy. Following the 2021 assassination of President Moïse, the country has been without elected leadership. Gang violence has led to the collapse of state authority in many areas.
- A **Transitional Presidential Council (TPC)** was installed in April 2024, tasked with appointing an interim government and organizing future elections, but faces immense challenges in establishing control and legitimacy amidst the ongoing security and humanitarian crises. There is effectively no ruling party; governance is fragmented and contested.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - **1804:** Haiti declares independence from France (first free Black republic). U.S. refuses recognition until 1862 due to slavery concerns.
  - **1915-1934:** U.S. occupation of Haiti.
  - **1957-1986:** Duvalier dictatorship (François "Papa Doc" and Jean-Claude "Baby Doc"). Relations fluctuate, marked by U.S. concerns over human rights and corruption alongside Cold War anti-communist alignment.
  - **1986:** Duvalier overthrown; period of instability and military rule follows.
  - **1990:** Jean-Bertrand Aristide elected in first free elections, overthrown by coup in 1991.
  - **1994:** U.S. leads military intervention (Operation Uphold Democracy) to restore Aristide to power. UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSTAH later MINUJUSTH/BINUH) presence begins, lasting in various forms for decades.
  - **2004:** Aristide ousted again amidst rebellion; U.S. facilitates departure. Renewed instability.
  - **2010:** Devastating earthquake kills estimated 200,000-300,000 people. Massive international aid response led by U.S.
  - **2017:** End of MINUSTAH peacekeeping mission, transition to smaller UN political mission (BINUH).
  - **July 2021:** President Jovenel Moïse assassinated, triggering profound political and security crisis.
  - **2022-present:** Escalating gang violence, collapse of state authority, formation of TPC in 2024, international efforts to deploy MSS mission.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - History marked by U.S. interventions (1915, 1994) and periods of strong support for specific governments alternating with criticism/distance due to governance issues. Long history of U.S. development and humanitarian assistance.
  - Key agreements focus on aid (USAID frameworks), security cooperation (support for HNP), counter-narcotics MOUs, trade preferences (HOPE/HELP Acts providing duty-free access for apparel).
  - Bilateral relations are currently defined by the **urgent need to address the multifaceted crisis**. The U.S. is the dominant international actor engaged in Haiti, working with Haitian stakeholders and international partners (UN, CARICOM, Canada, France) to find solutions, but facing immense challenges and historical baggage from past interventions.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S. is Haiti's largest trading partner. Bilateral trade is modest, around **$1.5-2 billion**, dominated by Haitian exports of apparel assembled in Haiti using U.S. components, benefiting from HOPE/HELP trade preferences. U.S. exports include food (rice, poultry), machinery, vehicles.
  - Remittances from the Haitian diaspora in the U.S. are a vital source of income, far exceeding exports or aid.
  - U.S. investment is limited, mainly in the apparel sector. The security crisis has devastated the economy and deterred investment.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Haiti has limited strategic resources. Its primary economic assets are its workforce (potential for light manufacturing/assembly) and proximity to the U.S. market. Agriculture has potential but is underdeveloped.
  - Economic partnerships are almost entirely focused on international aid (U.S., Canada, EU, World Bank, IDB) and diaspora remittances. Its economic future depends heavily on restoring security and stability to enable recovery and investment.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - **Rampant gang violence** and collapse of state security is the primary threat, with potential regional spillover (migration, arms trafficking).
  - **Transnational crime:** Haiti is a transit point for narcotics (cocaine) flowing from South America towards the U.S. Arms trafficking into Haiti fuels gang violence. Human smuggling is also a concern.
  - **Political instability** itself is a major security threat. Low risk of external military threats or conventional terrorism, focus is internal breakdown.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - U.S. does not have military cooperation with Haitian armed forces (which were disbanded, then recently reconstituted but are very small/weak). U.S. security assistance focuses on supporting the **Haitian National Police (HNP)** through funding, training (INL programs), equipment, and advisory support. This support is crucial but faces immense challenges given HNP's capacity limits and the scale of gang power.
  - The main security partnership currently sought is the **UN-authorized Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission**, which the U.S. is funding and facilitating but not leading militarily. Cooperation with Kenya (lead nation) and other contributing countries is key.
  - Future cooperation hinges on successful deployment of MSS, rebuilding HNP capacity (with vetting), and eventually establishing sustainable Haitian security institutions under legitimate civilian control.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Haiti's diplomatic influence is currently minimal due to its internal crisis and lack of recognized elected government. It participates in CARICOM, OAS, UN but its voice is severely weakened.
  - Historically, Haiti holds symbolic importance as the first free Black republic and for its cultural influence.
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Currently, Haiti is the *subject* of multilateral diplomacy rather than an active participant. U.S. works through multilateral frameworks (UN Security Council authorizing MSS, CARICOM facilitating political transition, OAS monitoring) to address the crisis. Future potential depends entirely on restoring a functioning, legitimate government.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Catastrophic human rights situation due to gang violence (killings, kidnappings, sexual violence) and state collapse. Impunity is total. Rule of law non-existent in many areas. Access to justice impossible for most. Freedom of press severely curtailed by insecurity. Humanitarian access restricted.
  - U.S. focus is on supporting efforts to restore security as a prerequisite for improving human rights, while funding humanitarian aid and advocating for protection of civilians. Supporting transitional justice for past abuses (including Moïse assassination) is a long-term goal.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Extreme instability. No elected government. Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) attempting to establish authority faces immense challenges from gangs and political fragmentation. Policy continuity is non-existent; focus is on basic survival and attempting to restore governance.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - Organization of American States (OAS)
  - CARICOM (Caribbean Community)
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - Various international conventions (human rights, environment - though implementation capacity is minimal)
  - U.S.-Haiti bilateral agreements on aid, counter-narcotics, trade preferences (HOPE/HELP)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Economy has collapsed. Formal trade severely disrupted by insecurity (port access issues). U.S. has imposed targeted sanctions (visa restrictions, asset freezes) on individuals (politicians, business figures) accused of financing gangs or corruption. Maintaining HOPE/HELP trade preferences for apparel sector (one of few remaining formal employers) is important but challenged by insecurity.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - No opportunities for new agreements currently. Focus is on humanitarian aid and stabilization. Long-term opportunities depend entirely on restoring security and governance, potentially allowing for renewed focus on trade capacity building, investment promotion (DFC), and leveraging trade preferences.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Haiti's internal crisis *is* the main geopolitical issue, impacting regional stability (migration to Dominican Republic, U.S., Bahamas) and requiring international response (MSS mission). Relations with Dominican Republic are often tense due to migration and border issues.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Main risk is **escalation of gang violence** and complete state failure. Low risk of traditional terrorism or military escalation. Cybersecurity infrastructure minimal.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Large Haitian diaspora in U.S. (Florida, NY, MA) is crucial economic lifeline (remittances) and influences U.S. policy debates. Irregular migration by sea/land towards U.S. is major concern. Cultural exchange limited by crisis. Public opinion desperate for security and stability, views on international intervention are complex due to historical experiences.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Shared democratic aspirations (though unrealized). Strong cultural identity (mix of African, French, Taino influences; Voudou widely practiced alongside Catholicism/Protestantism). Resilience in face of adversity. Divergences relate to deep issues of governance, social structure, historical trauma.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Haiti extremely vulnerable to hurricanes, floods, droughts, sea-level rise. Deforestation is severe, exacerbating vulnerability. Climate shocks compound existing crises. U.S. interest in regional stability impacted by Haiti's vulnerability, provides disaster relief.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Opportunities severely limited by crisis. Long-term potential for reforestation, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy (solar) projects as part of recovery/development efforts, requiring massive international support.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Natural disasters frequently trigger humanitarian crises, displacement, and potential migration surges, impacting U.S./regional stability. Environmental degradation worsens poverty and vulnerability.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term likely would have focused heavily on **migration control**, potentially adopting harsher interdiction policies and reducing pathways for Haitian asylum seekers. Support for long-term development aid or democracy promotion might have decreased in favor of transactional approaches focused solely on stopping migration or counter-narcotics.
- Engagement with multilateral efforts (UN, CARICOM) to address the crisis might have been less consistent or more unilateral. Rhetoric towards Haiti could have been negative (reflecting past reported comments).
- Impact could have been reduced humanitarian/development aid, potentially worsening the crisis, increased friction over migration policies, and less effective international coordination, though security cooperation on interdiction might have continued.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, the U.S. should **reaffirm commitment to supporting Haitian-led solutions** for stability and democracy, working closely with international partners (UN, CARICOM). Restore robust humanitarian and development assistance levels. Adopt humane and orderly processes for migration management.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Haiti Partnership for Food Security and Rural Recovery"** (as part of broader stabilization/development efforts, once security permits):
    - **Emergency Food Assistance & Agricultural Inputs:** Provide immediate food aid (WFP, NGOs) while also distributing seeds, tools, and livestock to help farmers restart production quickly once security allows. Support rehabilitation of irrigation systems.
    - **Climate-Resilient Agriculture:** Introduce drought-resistant/flood-tolerant crop varieties and sustainable farming techniques (agroforestry, soil conservation). Provide technical assistance via USAID/Feed the Future and NGO partners.
    - **Rural Infrastructure & Market Access:** Invest in rehabilitating rural roads, storage facilities, and market infrastructure. Support farmer cooperatives and linkages to local/potentially export markets.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Haiti Agricultural Task Force** (when a functioning government exists) to coordinate these efforts, monitor food security indicators, and align with Haiti's national recovery plans.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. commitment to Haiti's long-term recovery and food security. Support community radio programs providing agricultural information.

## 4. Policy Goals

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

- **Past and present contributions:** Minimal currently due to crisis. Historically, participation in regional forums (CARICOM, OAS), cooperation on counter-narcotics at times. Diaspora contributes to U.S. society.
- **What we would like in the future (post-stabilization):** Become a stable, democratic neighbor; cease being a major source of irregular migration and instability; cooperate effectively against transnational crime (drugs, arms trafficking); participate constructively in regional organizations.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

- **Needs:** Urgent security support (MSS mission, HNP capacity building); coordinated political support for transitional governance and elections; massive, sustained humanitarian aid; long-term development assistance (poverty reduction, job creation, agriculture, infrastructure, health, education); support for transitional justice/rule of law; climate adaptation/disaster resilience support.

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

- Implement a **"Haiti Stabilization and Recovery Strategy"** focused on sequential priorities:
    1.  **Security First:** Ensure rapid deployment and effective operation of the MSS mission; provide robust support to vet/rebuild the HNP; support efforts for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of gang members where feasible.
    2.  **Political Transition:** Strong diplomatic support (with CARICOM/UN) for the TPC and subsequent interim government; technical/financial assistance for eventual elections; support for national dialogue and constitutional reform processes if pursued by Haitians.
    3.  **Humanitarian Response:** Sustained, high levels of humanitarian aid (food, health, water/sanitation, shelter) delivered through trusted partners, with focus on ensuring access.
    4.  **Laying Groundwork for Recovery:** Initiate early recovery programs focused on basic service delivery, cash-for-work, agricultural support, and critical infrastructure repair as security permits.
    5.  **Long-Term Development (post-stabilization):** Plan for comprehensive, long-term development assistance focused on governance, economic diversification, education, health, and resilience, coordinated through international donor platform.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

- **Facilitate deployment and success of the MSS mission**.
- **Support a Haitian-led political transition** resulting in credible elections and legitimate governance.
- **Alleviate the humanitarian crisis** and ensure aid access.
- **Prevent Haiti's crisis from further destabilizing the region**.
- **Manage irregular migration** humanely and effectively.
- **Coordinate international efforts** (UN, CARICOM, OAS, donors) for a unified approach.

**Economic Strategies:**

- **Provide urgent humanitarian funding**.
- **Support early recovery** and basic economic activity as security allows.
- **Plan for long-term development aid** focused on job creation, agriculture, infrastructure.
- **Maintain trade preferences** (HOPE/HELP) to preserve remaining formal jobs (apparel).
- **Address Haiti's external debt** situation within international frameworks once a government is in place.
- **Promote diaspora investment** and engagement in recovery.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**

- **Assessment:** Public health system has largely collapsed due to insecurity. Access to basic care minimal. High rates of infectious disease, malnutrition, maternal/child mortality. Cholera re-emerged. Extremely low pandemic preparedness.
- **Opportunities:** Focus on emergency health response via NGOs/UN agencies. Support basic service delivery (vaccinations, maternal care) where access permits. Rebuild health infrastructure/workforce as part of long-term recovery.
- **U.S. Wants:** Prevent major disease outbreaks/famine; restore basic health services; rebuild surveillance capacity long-term.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Fund humanitarian health partners; coordinate with WHO/PAHO; support MSS in facilitating health access; plan for long-term health system reconstruction aid.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**

- **Evaluation:** Major source of irregular migration (sea/land) towards U.S., Dominican Republic, Bahamas, etc., driven by desperation. Dominican Republic border tense, deportations common. Coast Guard interdictions frequent.
- **Impact:** Significant strain on U.S. border/migration management systems and regional partners. Humanitarian concerns for migrants.
- **Response:** Continue maritime interdictions humanely. Support regional partners hosting Haitians. Address root causes through stabilization/development efforts in Haiti (long-term). Maintain pathways for legal migration where possible (e.g., humanitarian parole, family reunification).
- **U.S. Wants:** Reduced irregular migration flows; humane management of borders; regional cooperation.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Combine interdiction with addressing root causes; regional diplomatic engagement (DR, Bahamas, etc.); support IOM/UNHCR efforts; maintain legal pathways.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**

- **Assessment:** Corruption is endemic and deeply entrenched, fueling instability and gang financing. State institutions lack capacity and legitimacy. Impunity prevails.
- **Measures:** Support anti-corruption efforts as part of political transition and long-term governance building. Promote transparency in aid delivery. Use targeted sanctions against corrupt actors/gang financiers. Technical assistance for building basic public financial management capacity in future government.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**

- **Analysis:** Haiti's participation is currently hampered by crisis. CARICOM playing lead role in facilitating political transition. UN (BINUH, Security Council authorizing MSS) is central. OAS monitors situation.
- **Leverage:** Work closely through CARICOM, UN, OAS to coordinate international response. Support these institutions' roles. Encourage unified regional approach.

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**

- **Issues:** Catastrophic situation. Widespread violence by gangs (killings, kidnapping, rape). Impunity. Lack of access to justice. Extreme poverty. Humanitarian access denied.
- **Influence:** Prioritize restoring security to protect basic right to life. Fund humanitarian aid. Support future transitional justice mechanisms. Advocate for civilian protection by all actors (including future MSS). Support Haitian human rights defenders.

**Technology & Cyber Cooperation:**

- **Needs:** Basic infrastructure non-existent or destroyed in many areas. No capacity currently.
- **Opportunities:** Long-term recovery phase could include support for rebuilding telecommunications and basic digital infrastructure.
- **U.S. Wants:** Not a current priority beyond basic communication needs for aid/security.

**Energy Transition & Green Finance:**

- **Roadmap:** Extremely low energy access, reliant on imported diesel for generators. Huge potential for solar but requires stability/investment. Deforestation severe.
- **Opportunities:** Long-term recovery must include focus on sustainable energy (off-grid solar, potentially microgrids). Reforestation programs critical. Access to climate/green finance essential for future.
- **Metrics:** Focus on basic energy access restoration first, then transition.

**Education & Workforce Development:**

- **Status:** Education system largely collapsed due to insecurity. Schools closed in many areas. Low enrollment/quality historically. Brain drain significant.
- **Initiatives:** Support emergency education programs (UNICEF, NGOs) where possible. Plan for major long-term investment in rebuilding education system and vocational training as part of recovery.
- **Outcomes:** Restore basic education access; build human capital long-term.

**Health Beyond Pandemics (Noncommunicable Diseases):**

- **Burden:** Data limited, but NCDs likely significant alongside high infectious disease/malnutrition burden. Access to care minimal.
- **Collaboration:** Focus on restoring basic primary care first, potentially integrating NCD screening later in recovery phase.

**Rule of Law & Judiciary Reform:**

- **Status:** Justice system non-functional in large parts of country. Impunity reigns. Urgent need to rebuild entire system.
- **Assistance:** Long-term effort requiring massive international support post-stabilization. Focus initially on basic policing, courts in secure areas, vetting personnel. Technical assistance for legal framework reform.
- **Benchmarks:** Establishment of functioning courts/prosecution, progress on key cases (e.g., Moïse assassination), reduction in impunity.

**Supply‑Chain Resilience:**

- **Industries:** Apparel sector (HOPE/HELP dependent) is main formal industry, severely impacted by crisis. No role in critical U.S. supply chains otherwise.
- **Incentives:** Maintain HOPE/HELP preferences to preserve remaining jobs. Support sector recovery post-stabilization.

**Diaspora & Remittance Flows:**

- **Diaspora:** Large, vital diaspora in U.S., Canada, France, DR. Remittances are largest source of foreign income.
- **Engagement:** Engage diaspora organizations in relief, recovery, and political dialogue efforts. Facilitate remittance flows. Leverage diaspora expertise.

**Cultural Heritage & Soft Power:**

- **Assets:** Rich Afro-Caribbean culture (art, music, literature, religion), historical significance. Citadelle Laferrière (UNESCO site).
- **Programs:** Support preservation of cultural heritage where possible. Fund cultural initiatives as part of long-term recovery/social cohesion efforts. Use public diplomacy to express solidarity and commitment.

**Tariff Report:**

- Haiti benefits from significant preferential trade access to the U.S. market, primarily through the **Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA)** and specific Haiti-focused legislation like the **HOPE (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement) Act** and **HELP (Haiti Economic Lift Program) Act**. These provide duty-free access for apparel products assembled in Haiti using U.S. or certain third-country inputs, crucial for its main export sector.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- Haiti is a significant source country for migration to the U.S., both regular (family reunification, diversity visa) and irregular (sea arrivals, land border crossings). There is a large Haitian-American population (over 1 million). The U.S. has specific programs like Haitian Family Reunification Parole and has used Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians following disasters/crises. Irregular migration remains a major policy challenge.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens **do not require a visa** for tourist or business stays in Haiti of up to 90 days. A valid U.S. passport is required. However, due to the extreme security situation, the U.S. Department of State currently has a "Level 4: Do Not Travel" advisory for Haiti, strongly warning citizens against travel.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Human rights protections have effectively collapsed amidst gang violence and state failure. The government is unable to protect citizens' basic rights, including the right to life and security.
- **Affected Groups:** The entire population is affected, particularly residents of gang-controlled neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince. Women and girls face extreme levels of sexual violence used as a weapon by gangs. Children are recruited into gangs. Journalists and activists operate at extreme risk. Displaced persons face dire conditions.
- **Suppressed Rights:** All fundamental rights are under severe threat. Freedom of movement is heavily restricted by gang checkpoints and violence. Access to food, water, healthcare, education is denied to many. There is no access to justice or rule of law in practice for most Haitians. Impunity for horrific crimes is rampant.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Prioritize support for restoring security (MSS, HNP) as the essential first step to enable basic human rights protection. Provide massive humanitarian aid to address rights to food, health, shelter. Advocate strongly for civilian protection by all actors. Support efforts to document abuses and plan for future accountability mechanisms (transitional justice). Use targeted sanctions against gang leaders and their financiers. Support Haitian civil society and human rights defenders where possible.
