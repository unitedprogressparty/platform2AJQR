---

### Preface

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Burkina Faso has been historically rooted in shared interests in regional stability, democracy promotion, and counterterrorism efforts. Recently, Burkina Faso has experienced significant political upheaval, including military coups in 2022 that have led to changes in governance and shifts in foreign policy orientation. The U.S. has expressed concerns about the rise of military-led governments in the region and their implications for democracy and human rights. However, Burkina Faso remains a key player in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel region, which has seen escalating violence from extremist groups. The U.S. continues to engage with Burkina Faso, focusing on security assistance and humanitarian aid amidst these challenges.

### Crises:

Burkina Faso is currently facing a multifaceted crisis marked by rising extremist violence, political instability, and humanitarian challenges. The country has been grappling with increased attacks from jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIS, leading to significant civilian casualties and displacement. The ongoing violence has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with over 1.5 million people internally displaced due to conflict. Additionally, the economic impact of these security challenges has exacerbated food insecurity, with millions facing malnutrition.

The political landscape in Burkina Faso has been further complicated by the military coups in January and September 2022, which ousted the civilian government. These developments have raised alarms regarding the future of democratic governance in the country. The military's consolidation of power has led to a suspension of constitutional order, presenting a challenge for U.S. diplomatic efforts aimed at promoting democracy and stability in the region.

In the broader West African context, Burkina Faso's crisis is intertwined with regional dynamics, including the spillover effects of conflicts in neighboring Mali and Niger. The Sahel region is increasingly seen as a hotspot for terrorism and organized crime, posing risks not only to local populations but also to international security interests. The potential for further unrest and the rise of rebel groups in Burkina Faso could destabilize the entire region, necessitating proactive measures from the U.S. and its allies.

Looking ahead, the risks of internal violence and socio-political fragmentation remain high. The military government faces the challenge of managing public discontent while addressing the security crisis. Ensuring that the situation does not deteriorate into a full-scale civil conflict will require concerted efforts from both Burkina Faso's leadership and international partners, including the U.S.

**Frank Narrative**

Burkina Faso has been a crucial partner for the United States in the Sahel region, particularly in the context of counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. has supported Burkina Faso through various security assistance programs aimed at enhancing the capabilities of its armed forces to combat extremist threats. In recent years, Burkina Faso's strategic location has made it a focal point for U.S. interests in promoting stability and security in West Africa. The country has hosted joint military exercises and training programs, contributing to a broader regional strategy against terrorism.

However, the recent coups have complicated this collaboration. The U.S. has expressed its concerns regarding the military's approach to governance and its implications for human rights and democratic norms. To ensure continued cooperation, the U.S. must engage diplomatically with the military leadership while emphasizing the importance of restoring democratic governance and addressing the root causes of extremism. The U.S. should leverage its influence to encourage Burkina Faso to prioritize human rights and foster an inclusive political process that incorporates civil society and opposition voices.

In the future, we would like Burkina Faso to reaffirm its commitment to democratic principles and human rights, which are vital for long-term stability. By providing support for political reforms and capacity-building initiatives, the U.S. can help Burkina Faso navigate its current political transition while addressing the pressing security concerns posed by extremist groups. Encouraging Burkina Faso to participate in multilateral initiatives focused on regional security could further enhance its role as a key partner in the fight against terrorism.

From Burkina Faso's perspective, the country needs sustained support from the U.S. in addressing its security challenges and humanitarian needs. Economic assistance and investment in social infrastructure will be crucial for rebuilding the nation and providing essential services to its population. By fostering economic diversification and resilience, the U.S. can help Burkina Faso reduce its dependence on external military support and enhance its capacity to address the underlying issues contributing to instability.

### 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

Burkina Faso is a landlocked country located in West Africa, bordered by Mali to the north, Niger to the east, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Côte d'Ivoire to the southwest. The country has a population of approximately 22 million people and operates under a presidential republic system of governance. Its economy is primarily agrarian, with agriculture accounting for a significant portion of GDP. The GDP per capita is around $790, indicating a low-income status. Burkina Faso struggles with high levels of poverty, limited access to healthcare, and inadequate educational resources. The Freedom House index scores the country as "Not Free," reflecting challenges in political rights and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Burkina Faso's strategic location in the Sahel region makes it a vital player in U.S. interests regarding regional stability and security. The country has been a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, with extremist groups increasingly operating within its borders. The U.S. has a vested interest in ensuring that Burkina Faso remains a partner in counterterrorism efforts, as instability in the region can have ripple effects on global security. Additionally, Burkina Faso's mineral resources, including gold, hold potential for economic partnerships that could enhance U.S. interests in the resource sector.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Burkina Faso has faced significant challenges, particularly following the military coups. The ruling military junta has suspended constitutional order and limited political freedoms, leading to a deterioration of democratic practices. The current junta in power is led by Captain Ibrahim Traoré, who came to power in a coup in September 2022. The situation raises concerns about the future of democratic governance and the potential for increased repression. The U.S. must carefully navigate its diplomatic approach to encourage a return to civilian rule and respect for human rights.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**

Significant historical events that have shaped U.S.-Burkina Faso relations include the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1960. The U.S. has engaged in various developmental and security assistance programs over the years. A notable moment was the signing of the 2016 Security Cooperation Agreement, which aimed to enhance military collaboration in counterterrorism efforts. However, the relationship has been strained by Burkina Faso's recent political shifts, particularly the military coups.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

Burkina Faso and the U.S. have cooperated on various security initiatives, including training programs for Burkinabé forces and intelligence sharing to combat terrorism. However, ongoing conflicts and the rise of extremist groups pose challenges to this partnership. The U.S. must balance its security interests with the need to promote democratic governance and human rights, which have been compromised in the current political climate.

### 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

**Trade Relationships:**

The trade relationship between the U.S. and Burkina Faso is relatively modest, with Burkina Faso primarily exporting gold, cotton, and livestock to the U.S. The U.S. imports limited agricultural products and minerals from Burkina Faso, with gold being the most significant export commodity. The trade dynamics are influenced by Burkina Faso's economic reliance on agriculture and mining.

**Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**

Burkina Faso is rich in mineral resources, particularly gold, which has become a crucial aspect of its economy. The U.S. has shown interest in investment opportunities in the mining sector. As Burkina Faso seeks to diversify its economy, U.S. partnerships in sustainable development and technology could play a pivotal role in enhancing economic resilience.

**Security & Defense:**

**Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**

Burkina Faso faces significant security threats from jihadist groups that have exploited the fragile security environment. The presence of extremist groups has led to increased violence and instability, posing risks not only to Burkina Faso but also to neighboring countries in the Sahel region. The U.S. has been involved in training and equipping Burkinabé forces to counter these threats.

**Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**

The U.S. has established military cooperation with Burkina Faso through various training programs and intelligence sharing. However, the recent political changes have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this collaboration. Future cooperation should prioritize human rights and democratic governance, ensuring that U.S. support aligns with broader strategic goals in the region.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

**Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**

Burkina Faso plays a crucial role in regional diplomacy, particularly in addressing security challenges in the Sahel. The U.S. can leverage Burkina Faso's position to foster multilateral efforts aimed at countering terrorism and promoting stability in West Africa. Engaging Burkina Faso in regional dialogues can enhance diplomatic relations and facilitate cooperative approaches to shared challenges.

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**

Burkina Faso's involvement in regional organizations such as ECOWAS provides opportunities for multilateral cooperation. The U.S. should encourage Burkina Faso to take an active role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution initiatives, thereby strengthening its diplomatic influence and promoting regional stability.
