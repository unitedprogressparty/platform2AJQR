# **Nigeria: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Nigeria has been an important ally for the United States in West Africa, characterized by its significant population, economic potential, and strategic location. Recent events have seen Nigeria grappling with multiple challenges, including security threats from Boko Haram and other extremist groups, a struggling economy exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and internal political tensions. The Biden administration has emphasized a commitment to strengthening ties with Nigeria, focusing on promoting democracy, security cooperation, and economic partnerships.

### **Crises:**

Nigeria is currently facing a multitude of crises that threaten both its stability and regional peace. The ongoing insurgency by Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), continues to displace millions and instill fear within communities. Recent attacks have led to increased violence in the northeastern part of the country, resulting in a humanitarian crisis that has attracted international attention. Additionally, the Fulani herdsmen and farmer conflicts have escalated, leading to significant fatalities and displacement in the Middle Belt region, further complicating the security landscape.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted Nigeria's economy, which was already struggling before the crisis due to fluctuating oil prices and a heavy reliance on crude oil exports. The economic downturn, combined with rising inflation, has increased poverty levels, exacerbating discontent among the populace. Protests against police brutality, notably the #EndSARS movement, highlighted widespread frustrations over governance and human rights abuses, signaling a potential for future unrest if grievances are not addressed.

Looking ahead, Nigeria faces the risk of increased violence and instability, particularly with the upcoming elections in 2023. The potential for electoral violence is heightened by ongoing ethnic and regional divisions, which have historically played a role in Nigeria's political landscape. Furthermore, the rise of separatist movements, such as the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), poses additional challenges to national unity and could lead to further conflict if not adequately managed.

In summary, Nigeria's crises are multifaceted, encompassing security threats, economic hardships, and political tensions that could destabilize the country and the region. The United States must remain engaged to support Nigeria in overcoming these challenges while promoting stability and democratic governance.

**Frank Narrative** 

Nigeria is a country with immense potential and critical importance to U.S. interests in West Africa. The nation plays a pivotal role in regional security, particularly in countering terrorism and violent extremism. Historically, Nigeria has been a partner in various U.S.-led initiatives aimed at promoting peace and stability in the region. The country has also been instrumental in contributing troops to peacekeeping missions across Africa, showcasing its commitment to regional security and stability. As Nigeria continues to confront the threats posed by extremist groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, U.S. support is essential for enhancing Nigeria's military capabilities and intelligence-sharing efforts.

In the realm of economic cooperation, Nigeria's vast resources, particularly its oil reserves, are critical to U.S. energy security. The United States has a vested interest in ensuring that Nigeria remains a stable and reliable supplier of oil. Beyond energy, there is potential for expanding trade relations in sectors such as agriculture, technology, and renewable energy. U.S. investment in Nigeria can foster economic diversification, reducing the country's dependence on oil and enhancing its resilience against global market fluctuations. In the future, we would like to see Nigeria actively engaging in economic reforms that promote transparent business practices and attract foreign investment.

Nigeria also seeks support from the United States in addressing its domestic challenges, particularly in governance and human rights. The need for economic diversification and technological assistance is evident, as Nigeria grapples with high unemployment rates and a growing youth population. U.S. assistance in education, vocational training, and infrastructure development could significantly impact Nigeria's economic landscape. Furthermore, cooperation in public health initiatives, particularly in combating infectious diseases and improving healthcare access, is vital for enhancing Nigeria's overall well-being.

In conclusion, Nigeria's strategic importance cannot be overstated. The United States stands to benefit from a stable, prosperous Nigeria that can act as a bulwark against regional instability. By fostering a collaborative partnership that addresses mutual interests, both nations can work towards achieving shared goals in security, economic development, and governance.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the most populous country on the continent, with an estimated population of over 200 million people. The country has a diverse geography that includes savannahs, forests, and coastal regions along the Atlantic Ocean. Nigeria operates as a federal republic, with a presidential system of governance. The economy is one of the largest in Africa, primarily driven by oil exports, which account for a significant portion of its GDP. As of 2023, Nigeria's GDP is approximately $440 billion, with a poverty rate exceeding 40%. The country ranks low on the Human Development Index, reflecting challenges in quality of life and access to basic services.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Nigeria's location and resources make it a critical player in regional and global stability. As a major oil producer, it is a key supplier to the global energy market, and fluctuations in oil prices can impact global economic conditions. Additionally, Nigeria's role in counterterrorism efforts, especially within the context of the Lake Chad Basin, highlights its importance to U.S. strategic interests in combating violent extremism and promoting regional security.

**Democracy Score:**

Nigeria's democracy score has faced challenges due to issues such as electoral violence, corruption, and human rights abuses. The current ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has been criticized for its governance practices, including a lack of transparency and accountability. While Nigeria has made strides in democratic reforms, the gap between official structures and real-world political dynamics often undermines democratic freedoms, leading to public discontent and unrest.

**Historical Context:**
