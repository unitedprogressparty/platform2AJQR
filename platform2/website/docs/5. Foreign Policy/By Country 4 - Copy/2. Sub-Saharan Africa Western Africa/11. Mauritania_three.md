# **Mauritania: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Mauritania, located in West Africa, has a complex relationship with the United States that has evolved over the years. The U.S. has engaged with Mauritania primarily through security cooperation, counterterrorism efforts, and development assistance. Recent events include Mauritania's participation in the Global Coalition Against ISIS and its role in regional security initiatives, particularly in the Sahel region, where the threat of terrorism and instability is prevalent. However, Mauritania faces internal challenges, including political repression and human rights abuses, which complicate its relationship with the U.S.

### **Crises**:

Mauritania currently faces several crises, both internally and regionally. Internally, the country has struggled with issues of governance, human rights abuses, and political repression. The government has been criticized for its handling of dissent and the repression of opposition voices, leading to tensions within the society. Regionally, Mauritania is affected by the instability in neighboring countries, particularly Mali, where a growing insurgency and violence from jihadist groups pose significant security risks. The potential spillover of violence from Mali into Mauritania remains a pressing concern.

Moreover, Mauritania grapples with economic challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has strained its already fragile economy. The country relies heavily on the extraction of natural resources, particularly iron ore, and faces the dual challenge of diversifying its economy while ensuring sustainable development. The potential for civil unrest over economic disparities and governance issues looms large, especially in the face of rising global inflation and food insecurity.

In addition, the Sahel region is experiencing a humanitarian crisis due to the effects of climate change, which has led to desertification and resource scarcity. This environmental degradation could fuel conflict and displacement, further complicating Mauritania's internal and external challenges. Addressing these crises will require concerted international support, including from the United States, to foster stability and development in the region.

**Frank Narrative** 

Mauritania holds a strategic position in West Africa due to its geographic location bordering the Atlantic Ocean and its proximity to the Sahel region, which has become a focal point for terrorism and insurgent activities. The United States has an interest in stabilizing this region to prevent the spread of extremism and ensure the security of trade routes. Mauritania can assist the U.S. in achieving these goals by enhancing its counterterrorism capabilities and intelligence-sharing efforts. The U.S. has provided military training and equipment to Mauritania, which has helped bolster its defense against potential threats. Future cooperation could involve more comprehensive training programs and joint exercises to strengthen Mauritania's military capacity.

In terms of political stability, the U.S. has a vested interest in promoting democratic governance and human rights in Mauritania. The country has faced criticism for its lack of political pluralism and human rights violations, which could undermine its stability and, by extension, the security of the region. The U.S. should leverage its diplomatic influence to encourage Mauritania to undertake meaningful political reforms and respect human rights. This could involve conditionality in aid and support, where increased assistance is tied to improvements in governance and democratic practices.

Economically, Mauritania's reliance on natural resource extraction presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The U.S. can support economic diversification efforts through investments in sectors such as agriculture and renewable energy. By fostering sustainable economic development, the U.S. can help Mauritania reduce its vulnerability to external shocks and promote stability. In return, Mauritania's economic growth could open new markets for U.S. businesses, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.

Finally, addressing the humanitarian and environmental challenges posed by climate change is crucial for both nations. The U.S. could collaborate with Mauritania on initiatives aimed at combating desertification and promoting sustainable resource management. Such cooperation would not only benefit Mauritania but also contribute to regional stability by mitigating the socio-economic impacts of climate change.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Mauritania is located in West Africa, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Senegal to the southwest, Mali to the southeast, and Algeria to the northeast. It has a population of approximately 4.5 million people and a GDP of about $8.6 billion USD (2022). The economy is heavily reliant on mining, particularly iron ore, which accounts for a significant portion of its exports. The country has a low Human Development Index, indicating challenges related to quality of life, education, and health. Mauritania's freedom index scores reflect notable restrictions on political freedoms and civil liberties, with significant concerns regarding human rights abuses.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Mauritania's strategic location makes it a key player in regional security dynamics. The country's vast desert landscape and borders with Mali and Algeria position it as a frontline state in the fight against terrorism and trafficking networks. Additionally, Mauritania's potential as an emerging energy producer, particularly with offshore oil and gas reserves, can have implications for energy security in the region. The stability of Mauritania is crucial for maintaining security in the Sahel, where extremist groups have gained a foothold.

**Democracy Score:**

Mauritania has faced significant challenges in its political landscape, characterized by authoritarian governance and limited political pluralism. The ruling party, the Union for the Republic (UPR), has been in power since 2009, and opposition parties have often been marginalized. Governance practices often fall short of democratic norms, with reports of political repression and human rights violations. Mauritania's democracy score reflects these shortcomings, highlighting the need for reforms to strengthen democratic institutions and practices.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
Bilateral relations between the United States and Mauritania have evolved over time, with key milestones including the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1960. In the early 2000s, the U.S. increased its engagement with Mauritania, particularly in counterterrorism efforts following the 9/11 attacks. The signing of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000 opened trade opportunities, and Mauritania has participated in various U.S.-led security initiatives.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
Mauritania's involvement in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is a notable example of cooperation in security matters. However, tensions have arisen over human rights issues, with U.S. criticism of Mauritania's governance practices sometimes straining relations. The recent political instability and protests against the government highlight the need for continued dialogue and cooperation to address these challenges.
