**Djibouti: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Djibouti, located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, is a small yet strategically significant country in the Horn of Africa. Its proximity to major maritime routes and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait makes it a vital hub for international shipping and military operations. The U.S. has maintained a military presence in Djibouti for years, with Camp Lemonnier serving as a crucial base for counterterrorism operations in East Africa and the Middle East. Recent events have highlighted the importance of Djibouti in the context of U.S. foreign policy, especially in light of increasing competition with China in the region, which has been expanding its influence through investments and infrastructure projects. 

### **Crises**:

Djibouti faces several crises, both internally and regionally. The country has a history of political instability, and while it has largely avoided the violence seen in neighboring Somalia, it grapples with issues such as high unemployment rates and limited political freedoms. The region is also affected by the ongoing conflict in Yemen, which has led to an influx of refugees and heightened security concerns. The humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate, with Djibouti being a primary entry point for aid, but also for unrest that may spill over into its borders. 

Moreover, the potential for conflict involving local ethnic groups poses a risk to Djibouti's stability. Tensions between the Afar and Issa populations have occasionally erupted into violence, and the government's ability to manage these conflicts is critical for maintaining peace. Additionally, the presence of international forces in Djibouti, including U.S. and French troops, complicates the local political landscape and raises concerns about sovereignty and national identity.

In the near future, Djibouti may face challenges related to climate change, such as water scarcity and food insecurity, which could exacerbate social tensions and lead to further instability. The potential for external actors, particularly China, to leverage these crises for influence in the region poses an ongoing challenge for U.S. interests. As Djibouti navigates these difficulties, the need for robust partnerships with international stakeholders remains essential.

**Frank Narrative**

Djibouti plays a pivotal role in helping the U.S. achieve its regional goals, particularly regarding counterterrorism and maritime security. The country serves as a critical base for U.S. military operations against Al-Shabaab in Somalia and other extremist groups in the region. Over the years, Djibouti has cooperated with the U.S. on intelligence sharing and training local security forces, which enhances regional stability and contributes to U.S. strategic interests. Our expectation is that Djibouti will continue to prioritize counterterrorism efforts and maintain a favorable environment for U.S. military operations.

In the future, we would like Djibouti to enhance its capabilities further in combating terrorism and organized crime. This can be achieved through increased training programs, intelligence cooperation, and funding for local law enforcement initiatives. Additionally, we hope to see Djibouti take a more active role in regional diplomacy, particularly in addressing the ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Somalia, which would ultimately benefit U.S. interests in promoting stability in the Horn of Africa.

Djibouti requires support from the U.S. and the international community to address its domestic challenges, particularly in economic diversification and infrastructure development. The country has relied heavily on its strategic location for revenue, but this model is not sustainable in the long term. U.S. support in the form of investments and technology transfer could help Djibouti develop sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, and tourism, leading to greater economic resilience. By fostering economic growth, we can help ensure a stable partner in the region.

Moreover, Djibouti seeks assistance with its public health system, which has been under strain due to limited resources and the influx of refugees. Strengthening health infrastructure and pandemic preparedness through U.S. support can yield long-term benefits for both nations. By collaborating on health initiatives, we can enhance Djibouti's ability to manage public health crises, which would also protect U.S. interests in the region.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Djibouti is a small country situated on the Horn of Africa, bordered by Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia, with coastlines along the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It has a population of approximately 883,000 people and covers an area of about 23,200 square kilometers. The economy is primarily based on services, particularly shipping and logistics, due to its strategic location. Djibouti’s GDP stands at approximately $3.5 billion, with a GDP per capita of around $4,000. The country faces challenges such as high unemployment rates, particularly among youth, and limited access to basic services. According to the Freedom House Index, Djibouti scores poorly on civil liberties and political rights, reflecting a lack of democratic governance.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Djibouti's strategic location makes it a critical player in global trade routes, particularly for maritime traffic between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The presence of foreign military bases, including the U.S., French, and Chinese facilities, highlights its significance for security and counterterrorism efforts in the region. Djibouti serves as a critical hub for humanitarian aid and emergency responses in the Horn of Africa, especially in light of the ongoing crises in Yemen and Somalia. The country’s stability is vital for ensuring safe passage for international shipping and maintaining regional security.

**Democracy Score:**

Djibouti's political landscape is characterized by a centralized government under President Ismail Omar Guelleh, who has been in power since 1999. The ruling party, the People's Rally for Progress (RPP), has maintained a tight grip on power, leading to significant restrictions on political freedoms and opposition activities. While there are formal structures for governance, the real-world dynamics reflect a lack of democratic practices, with limited room for civil society and political dissent. Recent elections have been criticized for lack of transparency and fairness, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the current regime.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**

The U.S. established a military presence in Djibouti after the events of September 11, 2001, recognizing the country's strategic importance for counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa. In 2002, the establishment of Camp Lemonnier marked a significant milestone in U.S.-Djibouti relations, providing a base for operations against Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups. Diplomatic ties have strengthened over the years, with the U.S. providing military assistance and training to Djiboutian forces.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

Djibouti has been a key partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, engaging in joint military exercises and intelligence-sharing agreements. However, relations have faced challenges, particularly regarding human rights abuses and political repression. The U.S. has occasionally expressed concerns over Djibouti's governance practices, which have strained bilateral ties. Despite these tensions, the strategic partnership remains strong due to shared security interests and mutual benefits.

Djibouti plays a crucial role in regional diplomacy, acting as a mediator in conflicts and hosting international negotiations. The country has been involved in peace talks concerning the situation in Somalia and has provided humanitarian assistance to Yemen. Djibouti's diplomatic efforts contribute to regional stability and are aligned with U.S. interests in promoting peace and security in the Horn of Africa.

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**

Djibouti's engagement in regional organizations, such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), positions it as a key player in multilateral cooperation. The U.S. can leverage Djibouti's influence to address shared challenges, such as combating terrorism and managing refugee crises. By supporting Djibouti's diplomatic initiatives, the U.S. can foster greater regional collaboration and conflict resolution.

### **3. Current Challenges and Opportunities**

**Political & Governance Issues:**

**Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**

Djibouti's governance practices are marked by significant human rights concerns, including restrictions on freedom of expression and political opposition. The government's crackdown on dissent has strained bilateral relations with the U.S., which prioritizes democratic values and human rights. Addressing these issues is essential for strengthening the partnership and ensuring long-term stability in Djibouti.

**Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**

The political landscape in Djibouti is characterized by a lack of opposition and limited political freedoms, raising concerns about stability. However, the government has maintained relative stability compared to its neighbors, which is crucial for U.S. interests in the region. The potential for political unrest, particularly among marginalized communities, necessitates continued engagement and support for democratic reforms.

**Current Agreements and Treaties:**

The U.S. and Djibouti have established several agreements related to military cooperation, counterterrorism, and economic development. Key partnerships include the U.S.-Djibouti Defense Cooperation Agreement, which facilitates military presence and joint operations. Additionally, Djibouti participates in various international treaties aimed at addressing regional security and humanitarian issues.

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

**Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
