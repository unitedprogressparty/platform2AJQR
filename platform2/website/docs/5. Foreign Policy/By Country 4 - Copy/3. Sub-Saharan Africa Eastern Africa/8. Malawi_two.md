# **Malawi: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Malawi share a positive and longstanding relationship based on shared democratic values (following Malawi's transition to multi-party democracy in the early 1990s), significant U.S. development and health assistance, and cooperation on regional issues. Malawi is generally viewed as a stable democracy in Southern Africa, albeit facing significant economic and development challenges. The U.S. is Malawi's largest bilateral donor, providing substantial support primarily focused on public health (especially through PEPFAR for HIV/AIDS and PMI for malaria), agriculture and food security (Feed the Future), education, and strengthening democratic governance. Current relations are **strong and cooperative, centered on development and health partnerships**, with the U.S. supporting Malawi's efforts to consolidate democracy, improve governance, combat corruption, and achieve sustainable economic growth.

### **Crises**

Malawi faces several significant ongoing crises, primarily economic and climate-related. The country is grappling with a severe **economic crisis**, characterized by acute foreign exchange shortages, high inflation, significant public debt, and difficulties importing essential goods like fuel and medical supplies. This crisis stems from structural weaknesses (reliance on rain-fed agriculture, narrow export base - mainly tobacco), external shocks (COVID-19, war in Ukraine impacting fertilizer/food prices), and governance challenges including past fiscal mismanagement. The government secured an IMF Extended Credit Facility in late 2023, contingent on reforms including a major currency devaluation, which further exacerbates cost-of-living pressures for the population.

Malawi is extremely vulnerable to **climate change** and recurrent **natural disasters**. It frequently experiences devastating floods (like those caused by Cyclone Freddy in 2023, which killed over 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands) and droughts, which severely impact agriculture (the livelihood for ~80% of the population), food security, infrastructure, and economic stability. This climate vulnerability represents an ongoing crisis requiring significant adaptation efforts and international support.

The country also faces a **public health crisis**, despite progress made with international support. High rates of HIV/AIDS (though prevalence has declined significantly due to PEPFAR), malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and maternal/child mortality persist. The health system is under-resourced and strained, particularly during climate shocks or disease outbreaks (cholera outbreaks are recurrent).

While politically stable compared to some neighbors, Malawi faces challenges related to **governance and corruption**, which undermine development efforts and public trust. Ensuring continued democratic consolidation, strengthening institutions, and effectively combating corruption are crucial for long-term stability.

Anticipated future crises include worsening **climate change impacts** leading to more frequent and severe floods/droughts and associated food insecurity/displacement. Failure to manage the **economic crisis** and implement reforms successfully could lead to prolonged stagnation or social unrest. Continued **public health challenges** require sustained international support. Potential for **political tensions** around future elections exists, although Malawi has a recent history of judicial independence upholding electoral integrity (e.g., the annulment of the 2019 presidential election).

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Malawi's contribution to U.S. regional goals in Southern Africa is primarily through its role as a **stable democracy** and its constructive participation in regional organizations. By consolidating its own democratic institutions and upholding rule of law (demonstrated notably by its judiciary annulling flawed election results in 2019 and overseeing a peaceful re-run election in 2020), Malawi serves as a **positive democratic example** in a region facing varied governance challenges. This aligns directly with the U.S. goal of promoting democracy and good governance. Historically, Malawi has been a consistent contributor to **regional peacekeeping operations** under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (e.g., contributing troops to missions in the DRC - MONUSCO, and previously in Kosovo/Ivory Coast). This supports U.S. interests in regional stability and burden-sharing for peace operations. Malawi generally adopts **moderate foreign policy positions** within regional bodies like SADC and the AU, often aligning with democratic principles and contributing to consensus-building. It also cooperates with the U.S. on **health security**, participating in regional disease surveillance networks and implementing large-scale U.S.-funded health programs (PEPFAR, PMI), which contributes to regional resilience against pandemics.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Malawi's continued commitment to **democratic governance and rule of law**, serving as a stabilizing influence and positive model. Continued contributions to **regional peacekeeping operations** are highly valued, and the U.S. can support this through training and potentially equipment assistance (e.g., via ACOTA program). Malawi can play a constructive role within **SADC** promoting democratic norms, peaceful conflict resolution, and regional economic integration, aligning with U.S. objectives. Enhanced cooperation on **countering transnational crime** (wildlife trafficking, potentially drug trafficking though less prominent than elsewhere) would be beneficial. As Malawi develops its economy, particularly agriculture, it could play a role in regional **food security**. Concrete actions could include Malawi championing specific democratic governance initiatives within SADC, increasing its peacekeeping contributions with U.S. support, and strengthening its anti-corruption efforts to enhance its credibility as a governance model. Accountability can be maintained through bilateral dialogues, monitoring of governance indicators (linked to potential MCC compact eligibility), and performance in regional security cooperation.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As one of the world's poorest countries facing significant economic and climate challenges, Malawi has profound needs for international support, particularly from the U.S. as its largest bilateral donor. The most critical need is **sustained development and humanitarian assistance** across multiple sectors. This includes support for **economic stabilization and recovery**, backing its IMF program, providing technical assistance for public financial management and debt sustainability, and potentially direct budget support (conditional on reforms). Assistance is desperately needed to address **food insecurity** and build **agricultural resilience** to climate change. U.S. support through **Feed the Future** is vital, focusing on climate-smart agriculture techniques, crop diversification (away from tobacco), irrigation development, improving market access for smallholders, and nutritional support. Benchmarks include improved food security indicators, increased agricultural productivity, and diversification of agricultural exports.

Malawi requires massive, ongoing support for its **public health system**. Continued robust funding for **PEPFAR (HIV/AIDS)** and **PMI (malaria)** is essential to maintain progress and prevent reversals. Assistance is also needed for maternal/child health, nutrition programs, tuberculosis control, strengthening primary healthcare delivery, health workforce training, and improving supply chain management for medicines. Support for **disease surveillance and pandemic preparedness** (building on lessons from COVID-19 and cholera outbreaks) is crucial for national and regional health security. Institutional partners include the Ministry of Health, local health facilities, NGOs, and global health initiatives (Global Fund, Gavi). Success metrics are improvements in key health indicators (HIV prevalence/treatment, malaria incidence, maternal/child mortality).

Addressing **climate change vulnerability** is another urgent need. Malawi needs significant international climate finance and technical assistance for **adaptation measures** (early warning systems for floods/droughts, climate-resilient infrastructure, watershed management, drought-resistant agriculture) and potentially for **renewable energy development** (hydro, solar potential) to improve energy access and reduce reliance on biomass/imported fuels. U.S. support can be channeled through USAID climate programs, contributions to international climate funds (GCF, Adaptation Fund), and technical expertise from agencies like NOAA/USGS.

Support for **education** (improving quality, access, especially for girls, vocational training) and **governance** (strengthening democratic institutions, anti-corruption efforts, judicial capacity, decentralization) remains crucial for long-term development. Potential future engagement through the **Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)**, if Malawi meets eligibility criteria on governance, could provide large-scale investment in key infrastructure or sectors. Finally, Malawi needs continued **diplomatic support** for its democratic path and constructive regional role.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Republic of Malawi is a landlocked country in Southeastern Africa, bordered by Zambia, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Its defining geographic feature is Lake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa), a vast freshwater lake that runs along most of its eastern border, part of the Great Rift Valley. The terrain is mainly plateaus and highlands. Population is around **20.9 million** (2023 estimate), with a high growth rate.
- Malawi is a **multi-party presidential republic**. It transitioned from one-party rule under Hastings Banda to multi-party democracy in 1993-1994.
- Economically, Malawi is classified as a **Least Developed Country (LDC)** and is one of the poorest countries in the world. GDP is approximately **$13 billion**. GDP per capita is extremely low, around **$600**. The economy is heavily reliant on **agriculture**, which employs the vast majority of the population. **Tobacco** is the dominant export crop, making the economy vulnerable to price fluctuations and anti-smoking campaigns. Maize is the main staple food. Poverty is widespread and deep.
- Quality of life indicators are very low. Life expectancy is around **65 years**. High rates of malnutrition, disease burden (HIV, malaria, TB), and low educational attainment persist despite progress. Access to basic services is limited, especially in rural areas.
- Freedom House ranks Malawi as **“Partly Free”** (score typically around 60/100), reflecting competitive elections and civil liberties alongside challenges like corruption, poverty impacting rights enjoyment, and occasional political tensions.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Malawi's importance to U.S. interests lies primarily in its status as a **stable democracy** in Southern Africa, serving as a positive example.
- It is a major recipient of U.S. **health and development assistance**, making it a key partner for achieving global health goals (HIV/AIDS control, malaria reduction) and food security objectives (Feed the Future).
- Its contributions to **regional peacekeeping** support stability efforts.
- Its location makes its stability relevant to neighbors like Mozambique and Tanzania.
- Supporting its development and resilience aligns with U.S. humanitarian values and long-term stability goals.

**Democracy Score:**

- Malawi has held regular multi-party elections since 1994. The judiciary has demonstrated independence, notably in annulling the 2019 presidential election due to irregularities and ordering a re-run in 2020, which resulted in a peaceful transfer of power to the opposition. Civil society is active, and media freedom exists, though faces economic pressures.
- Governance challenges include pervasive corruption, weak institutional capacity, political patronage, and ensuring continued electoral integrity.
- The current President is **Lazarus Chakwera** (Malawi Congress Party - MCP), who won the 2020 election re-run leading the Tonse Alliance coalition.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - **1964:** Malawi gains independence from the UK under Hastings Banda; U.S. establishes relations. Relations during Banda's autocratic rule (until 1994) were correct but limited.
  - **1994:** Transition to multi-party democracy. U.S. strongly supports transition, significantly increases development assistance.
  - **2000s-present:** Deepening partnership focused on development, particularly health (PEPFAR launched 2003, PMI), food security (Feed the Future), education, and democracy/governance support. Malawi becomes major recipient of U.S. aid.
  - **2011:** Malawi qualifies for MCC compact focused on energy sector.
  - **2019-2020:** Political crisis following disputed election; judiciary annuls result; peaceful re-run election won by opposition, strengthening democratic credentials. U.S. supports electoral process and peaceful transition.
  - **Ongoing:** Strong partnership centered on development/health, support for economic reforms (IMF program), climate resilience.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Malawi trade is very small, likely under **$100 million** annually. U.S. exports include machinery, vehicles, cereals, used clothing. U.S. imports primarily tobacco, tea, sugar, nuts, apparel (under AGOA).
  - Malawi's main trading partners are regional (South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania) and international (EU, UK, China, India). Tobacco exports are crucial but face declining global demand.
  - U.S. investment is minimal. Opportunities exist (agribusiness, energy, tourism) but hampered by poor infrastructure, challenging business climate, and economic crisis.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Malawi's main resource is **arable land** and Lake Malawi (fisheries, tourism potential). It has some mineral deposits (uranium historically, rare earths potential) but mining sector underdeveloped. **Tobacco** is dominant cash crop.
  - Economic partnerships focus on development aid (U.S., UK, EU, World Bank, AfDB are major donors), regional integration (SADC, COMESA), and attracting investment. China's economic role has increased but less dominant than in some African countries. U.S. economic interests focus on supporting sustainable development, food security, and improving investment climate.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - Low direct external threats. Main security concerns are **internal stability** linked to poverty/economic crisis, potential spillover from regional instability (e.g., insurgency in northern Mozambique historically impacting border areas), **transnational crime** (wildlife trafficking, human trafficking).
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - U.S.-Malawi defense cooperation focuses on **professionalization** of the Malawi Defence Force (MDF), **peacekeeping capacity building** (Malawi is consistent troop contributor), disaster response preparedness, and maritime security on Lake Malawi. U.S. provides training (IMET, ACOTA) and limited equipment assistance.
  - Malawi participates actively in SADC security cooperation mechanisms and contributes troops to UN/AU peacekeeping missions (e.g., DRC).
  - Future cooperation likely continues focus on peacekeeping, disaster response, professionalization, potentially enhancing border security capacity.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Malawi plays a constructive role within **SADC** and the **African Union**. It generally adopts moderate positions and supports multilateralism. Its democratic credentials give it positive influence.
  - Active participant in UN, Commonwealth. Chairs LDC group at times.
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Can serve as positive democratic example. Contributes reliably to peacekeeping. Can play role within SADC promoting regional integration and stability. U.S. supports its constructive multilateral engagement.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Democratic institutions function but need strengthening. Judiciary has shown independence. Civil society/media operate freely but face resource constraints. Key challenges include combating **corruption**, ensuring **accountability**, improving **access to justice**, and protecting rights of vulnerable groups (women, children, persons with albinism).
  - U.S. supports governance reforms, anti-corruption efforts, judicial strengthening, civil society capacity building through USAID programs.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Multi-party system provides stability through elections. Current Chakwera government faces significant pressure due to economic crisis but democratic framework remains intact. Policy continuity focuses on development goals (Malawi 2063 vision), economic reforms (IMF program), and maintaining traditional foreign policy alignments.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - African Union (AU)
  - SADC (Southern African Development Community)
  - COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa)
  - Commonwealth of Nations
  - African Development Bank (AfDB)
  - International Criminal Court (ICC)
  - AGOA eligibility
  - PEPFAR partnership
  - PMI partnership
  - Feed the Future initiative
  - Peace Corps agreement
  - Various international conventions (climate, biodiversity, human rights, etc.)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Main concerns are **severe economic crisis** (forex shortage, debt, inflation), **over-reliance on tobacco**, vulnerability to climate shocks impacting agriculture. No major U.S. sanctions. Need to improve capacity to utilize trade preferences (AGOA).
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Opportunities lie in supporting **economic diversification** (agribusiness beyond tobacco, aquaculture, tourism, light manufacturing). Promoting **private sector investment** (DFC potential) conditional on reforms/stability. Supporting implementation of **AfCFTA**. Potential for future **MCC compact** if governance indicators improve sufficiently. Enhancing **energy access** (renewables).

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Generally stable region but instability in eastern DRC (where Malawi contributes peacekeepers) and northern Mozambique historically are concerns. Strong ties with neighbors (Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique). Active member of SADC.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Low direct terrorism risk. Low risk of military escalation. Main risks are internal instability from economic crisis, climate shocks, or potential political tensions. Cybersecurity capacity very low.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Limited emigration compared to some African countries. Hosts some refugees (mainly from DRC, Burundi). Peace Corps program fosters cultural exchange. Public opinion generally positive towards U.S. due to significant aid presence.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Predominantly Christian society. Generally conservative social values. Shared democratic aspirations. Importance of community/family.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Malawi extremely vulnerable (floods, droughts, cyclones impacting agriculture, infrastructure, health). Deforestation (for fuel wood, agriculture) exacerbates problems. U.S. interest in global climate action, humanitarian response, regional stability affected by Malawi's vulnerability.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Major need/opportunity for U.S. support in **climate adaptation** (climate-smart agriculture, early warning systems, watershed management, resilient infrastructure). Promote **renewable energy** (hydro, solar) to increase energy access/reduce deforestation. Support sustainable land management/reforestation. Access to climate finance crucial.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Climate shocks are major drivers of food insecurity, displacement, economic loss, potentially leading to instability. Competition over resources (land, water) could increase.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have seen **reductions in development aid**, particularly for democracy/governance programs and potentially climate initiatives. Health funding (PEPFAR/PMI) might have faced pressure but possibly endured due to bipartisan support.
- Focus might shift to narrow transactional interests or burden-sharing demands (e.g., for peacekeeping contributions). Support for multilateral institutions (World Bank, AfDB) providing crucial support to Malawi might weaken.
- Impact could be significant reduction in U.S. support for Malawi's development, potentially undermining progress on health, food security, and democratic governance, weakening U.S. influence and soft power.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, U.S. should **reaffirm commitment to Malawi's development and democracy**. Restore funding levels for health, agriculture, education, governance programs. Re-engage strongly in supporting climate adaptation and multilateral development efforts.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Malawi Partnership for Climate-Resilient Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation"**:
    - **Climate Adaptation:** Scale up support (USAID/Feed the Future) for adoption of drought/flood-tolerant crop varieties (maize, legumes, roots), water harvesting techniques, conservation agriculture, agroforestry. Support development/dissemination of climate information services for farmers.
    - **Diversification & Value Chains:** Provide technical assistance and finance (DFC potential) to support diversification away from tobacco into other cash crops (coffee, tea, nuts, legumes, horticulture) and value addition (processing, storage). Improve market linkages for smallholders. Support sustainable aquaculture development in Lake Malawi.
    - **Land & Water Management:** Support community-based sustainable land and watershed management programs to reduce erosion/deforestation and improve water retention. Support rehabilitation/development of small-scale irrigation schemes.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Malawi Agricultural Task Force** to coordinate efforts, monitor progress (food security, crop diversification, climate resilience indicators), and align with Malawi's National Agriculture Policy and Malawi 2063 vision.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. commitment to Malawi's agricultural future and climate resilience. Expand exchanges focused on agriculture, environment, climate science (Peace Corps, university links, farmer exchanges).
