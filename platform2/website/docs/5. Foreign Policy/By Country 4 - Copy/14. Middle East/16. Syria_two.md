# **Syria: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Syria currently have **no diplomatic relations** and are effectively in an adversarial posture. The relationship collapsed following the Syrian regime's brutal crackdown on peaceful protests in 2011, which escalated into a devastating civil war. The U.S. strongly condemned the actions of the regime led by Bashar al-Assad, called for his departure, imposed extensive sanctions, provided support to the moderate Syrian opposition (though this support has varied over time), and leads the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, which operates in parts of Syria. The U.S. maintains a limited military presence in eastern Syria focused on preventing an ISIS resurgence and supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Current U.S. policy focuses on **countering ISIS, providing humanitarian assistance** to the Syrian people, supporting a political solution consistent with UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2254, promoting accountability for regime atrocities, and isolating the Assad regime through sanctions and diplomatic pressure. There is no prospect of normalized relations under the current regime and circumstances.

### **Crises**

Syria remains engulfed in one of the world's most complex and devastating **protracted crises**, stemming from the civil war that began in 2011. This encompasses multiple overlapping dimensions:
1.  **Ongoing Conflict and Security Crisis:** While large-scale fighting has subsided compared to peak years, active conflict persists in several areas, particularly the northwest (Idlib region, involving regime forces, Russian/Iranian allies, Turkish-backed opposition, and extremist groups like Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham - HTS) and sporadic ISIS insurgent activity in the east/desert regions. The country is effectively fragmented, with different territories controlled by the Assad regime (backed by Russia/Iran), Turkish-backed opposition forces, the SDF (backed by U.S. in the east), and HTS. External actors (Russia, Iran, Turkey, U.S., Israel) are militarily involved, creating risks of escalation or unintended clashes.
2.  **Humanitarian Catastrophe:** The conflict has caused immense human suffering. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, and over half the pre-war population remains displaced – roughly 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and over 6.6 million refugees hosted primarily in neighboring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan). Over 15 million Syrians require humanitarian assistance. Poverty is rampant (estimated 90% below poverty line), infrastructure is destroyed, food insecurity is severe, and access to basic services (health, water, education) is critically low.
3.  **Political Crisis:** There is no viable political solution in sight. The Assad regime remains entrenched in power in Damascus, propped up by Russia and Iran, and shows no willingness to engage in meaningful political transition under UNSCR 2254. The UN-led constitutional committee process has stalled. Opposition groups are fragmented and weakened. Achieving a political settlement that addresses governance, accountability, and refugee return remains elusive.
4.  **Economic Collapse:** Syria's economy is shattered by war, corruption, mismanagement, sanctions, and the financial crisis in neighboring Lebanon. Currency has collapsed, inflation is rampant, and reconstruction needs are astronomical ($250-400 billion estimated). Illicit economies, including the Captagon drug trade allegedly linked to the regime, flourish.
5.  **Governance and Human Rights Crisis:** The Assad regime continues systematic human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances, suppression of dissent, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians historically. Rule of law is non-existent in political matters. Accountability for widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity remains absent.

Anticipated future crises include potential **renewed large-scale conflict** (e.g., regime offensive on Idlib), further **economic collapse** leading to famine conditions, **disease outbreaks** (cholera already present), **regional escalation** involving external actors operating in Syria (U.S., Russia, Iran, Israel, Turkey), continued **ISIS resurgence**, and potential **destabilization from climate change impacts** (water scarcity, drought). The lack of political resolution ensures the crisis will persist.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Under the current Assad regime, Syria **actively undermines** nearly all U.S. regional goals. It serves as a platform for **Iranian malign influence** (hosting Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force and allied militias like Hezbollah), enabling threats against Israel and U.S. forces in the region. It maintains a close alliance with **Russia**, providing Moscow with military bases (Tartus naval base, Hmeimim air base) and diplomatic support, challenging U.S. influence. The regime is a major source of **regional instability**, generating massive refugee flows that burden neighbors (Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey) and Europe, and engaging in illicit activities like the **Captagon drug trade** that destabilizes the region. It brutally suppresses its own population, violating human rights and democratic norms the U.S. seeks to promote. It actively obstructs efforts to counter **ISIS** in areas it controls and fails to cooperate on counterterrorism beyond its narrow interests. Historically, prior to the 2011 uprising, there were brief periods of limited tactical cooperation with the U.S. on specific counterterrorism issues (post-9/11) or indirect engagement related to Iraq, but these were exceptions within a generally adversarial relationship dating back decades (Syria was long on U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list).

Looking forward, a **fundamentally different Syria** – one governed legitimately, free from malign external influence (Iran, Russia), respecting human rights, and at peace with its neighbors – *could* theoretically contribute to U.S. goals. Such a Syria could:
1.  Cease being a platform for **Iranian/Russian power projection** and threats against U.S. partners.
2.  Cooperate genuinely in the **enduring defeat of ISIS** and other extremist groups.
3.  Engage constructively in **regional diplomacy** and cease destabilizing activities (Captagon trade).
4.  Allow for the **safe, voluntary, and dignified return of refugees**, easing regional burdens.
5.  Implement **political reforms** consistent with UNSCR 2254, contributing to long-term stability.
6.  Potentially become a partner in **regional economic cooperation** and energy transit (historically had pipelines).

However, achieving this requires a complete transformation of the current regime and political landscape, which is not foreseeable. Therefore, U.S. policy cannot rely on Syria helping achieve regional goals; rather, it focuses on **mitigating the threats emanating from Syria** (ISIS, Iran/Russia influence, instability, humanitarian crisis) and supporting a long-term political transition aligned with UNSCR 2254, however distant that prospect may be.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

From the perspective of the Syrian people and U.S. interests in long-term stability, Syria *needs* a **cessation of conflict** nationwide, a **credible political transition** consistent with UNSCR 2254 leading to inclusive and legitimate governance, **accountability** for mass atrocities and human rights violations committed during the conflict (by all sides, but overwhelmingly by the regime), massive **humanitarian assistance** to alleviate widespread suffering, and eventually enormous resources for **reconstruction and recovery**. It needs the **withdrawal of foreign forces** operating outside international mandates (especially Iranian-backed militias) and an end to external interference undermining Syrian sovereignty (while acknowledging legitimate counter-ISIS efforts). Syria needs **economic reforms** that dismantle corruption and the war economy, promote inclusive growth, and create opportunities for its population, particularly youth. It needs **rebuilding of its social fabric** through reconciliation processes and support for civil society. It needs **safe conditions for the voluntary return of refugees and IDPs**.

The current Assad regime, however, perceives its needs primarily as **regime survival and consolidation of control**. It seeks **international re-legitimization** (e.g., readmission to Arab League achieved partially, lifting of sanctions), **reconstruction funding** without meaningful political concessions or accountability, **cessation of all foreign military presence** it deems hostile (U.S., Turkey), and **acceptance of its authority** over all Syrian territory. It needs continued **military and economic support from its allies (Russia, Iran)** to maintain power. It likely needs the continuation of illicit revenue streams (like Captagon trade) to fund itself amidst economic collapse and sanctions.

U.S. policy cannot meet the needs perceived by the Assad regime as they contradict core U.S. interests and values (democracy, human rights, regional stability, counter-Iran/Russia). Instead, U.S. policy focuses on addressing the **humanitarian needs of the Syrian people** (providing aid through channels bypassing the regime where possible), supporting efforts towards **accountability** for atrocities, maintaining pressure on the regime through **sanctions** (Caesar Act, etc.) to prevent normalization without political progress, supporting a **political solution aligned with UNSCR 2254**, and **countering ISIS** to prevent its resurgence. The U.S. provides support to partners like the SDF in eastern Syria to maintain stability and deny space to ISIS in areas outside regime control. The long-term need is for a political transition that allows a legitimate Syrian government to address the needs of its people and reintegrate responsibly into the region and world.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Syrian Arab Republic is located in the Middle East (Levant region), bordering Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey, with a coastline on the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Its geography includes coastal plains, mountain ranges, desert steppes, and the Euphrates river valley. Population estimates vary due to displacement, but roughly **23 million** pre-war, now significantly lower within Syria (perhaps 16-18 million?) with millions displaced internally or as refugees. Predominantly Arab, with significant Kurdish minority and smaller groups. Majority Sunni Muslim, with Alawite (Assad family's sect), Christian, Druze minorities.
- Syria is nominally a **republic under an authoritarian Ba'athist regime**, led by President Bashar al-Assad since 2000 (succeeding his father Hafez al-Assad). Since 2011, the country has been devastated by civil war, leading to de facto fragmentation of control.
- Economically, Syria's economy has been **shattered by conflict, sanctions, corruption, and mismanagement**. Pre-war, it was lower-middle-income, reliant on oil, agriculture, services. Now, GDP has collapsed, poverty exceeds 90%, infrastructure destroyed. Relies on allies (Iran, Russia) and illicit economies (Captagon).
- Quality of life indicators have plummeted. Life expectancy significantly reduced. Healthcare system decimated. Education disrupted for millions. Massive humanitarian crisis.
- Freedom House ranks Syria as **“Not Free”** with one of the lowest scores globally (typically 1-2/100), reflecting extreme political repression, lack of civil liberties, pervasive violence, and absence of rule of law under Assad regime and in conflict zones.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Syria's importance stems primarily from its role as an arena of **regional and great power competition** (U.S., Russia, Iran, Turkey, Israel, Gulf states all involved).
- Epicenter of **humanitarian catastrophe** with massive displacement impacting regional stability and Europe.
- Key battleground in the fight against **ISIS**; preventing its resurgence is vital U.S. CT interest.
- Platform for **Iranian malign influence** (IRGC, Hezbollah) threatening Israel and regional stability.
- Host to **Russian military bases**, enabling Moscow's power projection in Mediterranean/Middle East.
- Source of regional instability through **refugee flows** and **illicit drug trade** (Captagon).
- Achieving a **political solution** aligned with UNSCR 2254 is long-term U.S. goal for regional stability.

**Democracy Score:**

- Syria is an **authoritarian dictatorship** under Bashar al-Assad and the Ba'ath Party. No genuine democracy exists. Elections held by regime are shams. No political rights or civil liberties respected. Extreme repression, torture, disappearances are systematic. Rule by security services (Mukhabarat).
- Governance fragmented across different zones of control (regime, SDF/U.S., Turkish-backed opposition, HTS). None represent democratic models, though SDF areas have local governance structures supported by U.S.
- Ruling power in Damascus is **Bashar al-Assad** and his inner circle, backed by military/security apparatus and external allies (Russia, Iran).

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - U.S. recognizes Syrian independence (1944). Relations often tense during Cold War due to Syria's alignment with Soviet Union, hostility towards Israel, involvement in Lebanon.
  - Syria on U.S. list of State Sponsors of Terrorism since 1979.
  - Brief improvement post-1991 Gulf War (Syria joined coalition against Iraq). U.S. engages Syria in Middle East peace process efforts (related to Golan Heights).
  - Relations worsen again post-2003 Iraq War (Syria opposed, accused of facilitating foreign fighters). U.S. imposes sanctions (Syria Accountability Act 2004).
  - **2011:** Syrian uprising begins. Assad regime responds with brutal violence. U.S. condemns crackdown, calls for Assad to step down, imposes sanctions, closes embassy (2012).
  - **2013:** Chemical weapons attack by regime at Ghouta. U.S. threatens military strikes, averted by Russia-brokered deal for Syria to give up declared chemical weapons (compliance later questioned).
  - **2014-present:** U.S. leads Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, conducts airstrikes and deploys small number of troops in eastern Syria supporting SDF partners. Focus shifts partly from Assad removal to counter-ISIS.
  - **Ongoing:** U.S. maintains sanctions (Caesar Act 2020 targets regime/supporters), provides humanitarian aid, supports UN political process (UNSCR 2254), maintains limited military presence for counter-ISIS. No normalization with Assad regime.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - Adversarial relationship for much of history, punctuated by brief tactical cooperation or engagement. U.S. military actions in Syria limited to counter-ISIS operations and occasional strikes against regime targets (e.g., after chemical weapons use). Deconfliction channel exists with Russia to avoid air incidents over Syria.
  - No significant bilateral agreements currently in force beyond basic diplomatic conventions (though relations suspended). U.S. provides aid via UN/NGOs, not through regime.
  - Bilateral relations are **non-existent at diplomatic level and fundamentally adversarial**. U.S. policy seeks regime change or fundamental behavior change through pressure and isolation, while mitigating humanitarian suffering and preventing ISIS resurgence.

---

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Syria trade is **negligible** due to extensive sanctions (Caesar Act, etc.) prohibiting most economic interactions with the regime and affiliated entities. U.S. licenses some limited trade related to humanitarian aid or activities in areas outside regime control.
  - Syria's main trading partners currently are allies like Iran, Russia, and some regional neighbors engaging in limited trade or seeking normalization (e.g., UAE, Jordan historically, though normalization efforts largely stalled). China also has economic presence. Illicit trade (Captagon) significant source of funds for regime.
  - U.S. investment non-existent. Western investment absent due to sanctions/conflict. Russian/Iranian companies involved in resource extraction/reconstruction in regime areas.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Syria possesses modest **oil and gas reserves** (mainly in east, largely outside regime control currently), phosphate deposits, agricultural land (Euphrates valley). Strategic importance lies more in its **location** (bordering key states, Mediterranean coast) and potential **transit routes** (pipelines historically).
  - Regime relies on economic partnerships with **Russia and Iran**. U.S. economic interests focus on **enforcing sanctions** to pressure regime, preventing reconstruction aid flowing without political progress, countering illicit finance (Captagon trade), and supporting economic stabilization in areas outside regime control (e.g., northeast Syria).

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - **ISIS resurgence** is primary shared concern where limited tactical alignment exists (both U.S. and regime oppose ISIS, though don't cooperate). However, regime's actions often exacerbate conditions allowing extremism. Presence of other extremist groups (HTS in Idlib) also concern. Proliferation of chemical weapons (regime's past use) major concern. Regional instability spillover.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - **Adversarial relationship**. U.S. maintains military presence in eastern Syria supporting SDF against ISIS, opposed by Assad regime. U.S. has conducted limited strikes against regime targets (chemical weapons use) and Iranian-backed militias attacking U.S. forces. Deconfliction channel with Russia active to prevent accidental clashes.
  - Syria heavily reliant on **military support from Russia** (airpower, bases, advisors) and **Iran** (IRGC, Hezbollah, other militias). Regime forces severely degraded by war. No prospect of U.S.-Syria military cooperation under current regime. U.S. focus is counter-ISIS, force protection, preventing conflict escalation with Russia/Iran in Syrian theater.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Assad regime largely **diplomatically isolated** from West, though recently regained seat in Arab League (2023) driven by some regional states seeking engagement. Influence relies heavily on patrons (Russia, Iran). Remains member of UN but lacks legitimacy for many states.
  - Plays spoiler role in regional stability. Engagement limited primarily to allies and some regional actors seeking specific outcomes (e.g., refugee return management, Captagon control).
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Regime actively obstructs UN-led political process (UNSCR 2254). Potential for cooperation minimal to non-existent on major issues. U.S. works through UN (Special Envoy, Security Council debates), Small Group on Syria (with key allies), and Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, largely bypassing or pressuring the regime.

---

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Catastrophic human rights situation under Assad regime (mass atrocities, torture, disappearances, chemical weapons use). Complete absence of democracy, rule of law, accountability. Human rights abuses also occur in areas outside regime control (by various armed groups).
  - U.S. policy strongly emphasizes accountability for atrocities, supports documentation efforts (e.g., via UN mechanisms), imposes sanctions on perpetrators, provides humanitarian aid based on need, supports political solution based on UNSCR 2254 respecting Syrian people's aspirations.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Assad regime remains in power in Damascus due to Russian/Iranian support, despite controlling only part of territory. Appears stable in areas it controls due to extreme repression, but lacks legitimacy and faces deep economic/social crises. Policy continuity focused solely on regime survival at any cost.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies (Syria's participation often contentious)
  - Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) (Syria member, but compliance repeatedly violated by regime)
  - Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
  - IMF and World Bank (Syria member, but access limited/frozen)
  - Arab League (membership restored 2023 after suspension)
  - Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)
  - Interpol
  - (Diplomatic relations with U.S. suspended)

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Main issue is comprehensive **U.S. and allied sanctions** (Caesar Act, etc.) targeting regime and its supporters, aiming to deny resources used for repression/war. Concerns about **humanitarian aid diversion** by regime. Illicit **Captagon trade** major concern. Economy collapsed.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - **None**. U.S. policy explicitly prohibits normalization or reconstruction aid without credible political transition under UNSCR 2254. Focus is on humanitarian exceptions to sanctions and supporting stabilization/livelihoods in areas outside regime control.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Syrian conflict is itself major driver of regional instability. Regime allied with Russia/Iran/Hezbollah, opposing U.S./partners/Israel. Conflict involves multiple external actors (U.S., Russia, Iran, Turkey, Israel) operating in close proximity, creating high risk of escalation. Syria used as conduit for Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes target Iranian presence. Turkish presence in north adds complexity.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - High risk of **ISIS resurgence**. Presence of other extremist groups (HTS). High risk of **military escalation** between external actors operating in Syria. Regime itself state sponsor of terrorism historically. Low national cybersecurity capacity but potential platform for state-sponsored cyber activity by allies (Russia/Iran).

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - World's largest displacement crisis (internal/external). Syrian diaspora large globally. Cultural exchange non-existent due to conflict/lack of relations. Public opinion within Syria difficult to gauge due to repression; diaspora largely opposes regime. Deep societal trauma and fragmentation from war.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Regime values contradict universal human rights/democratic values. Syrian society itself diverse historically, with rich cultural heritage now devastated by conflict. Shared humanity drives U.S. humanitarian response.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Syria highly vulnerable to drought, water scarcity (Euphrates flow reduced), desertification, impacting agriculture/stability. War severely damaged environment/infrastructure needed for adaptation. U.S. interest in regional stability affected by climate vulnerability exacerbating crisis.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - **None** currently feasible with regime. Long-term recovery/reconstruction would need to incorporate climate resilience/sustainable energy, requiring massive international effort post-political settlement.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Water scarcity can fuel conflict/displacement. Environmental degradation worsens humanitarian crisis. Climate impacts add another layer of stress to already fragile region.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have seen **reduced focus on promoting political transition (UNSCR 2254)** and potentially greater willingness to accept Assad's continued rule if focused narrowly on counter-ISIS or striking deals with Russia. Commitment to maintaining U.S. troop presence in eastern Syria could waver.
- Emphasis on humanitarian aid might decrease. Sanctions policy could become less consistent or used more transactionally.
- Impact could be further erosion of international pressure on Assad regime, potential gains for Russia/Iran influence, uncertainty for SDF partners, and potentially reduced leverage for achieving long-term U.S. goals related to stability and accountability.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- Restoring bilateral relations is **not feasible or desirable** under the current Assad regime. Any future restoration would require a fundamental political transition in Syria consistent with UNSCR 2254, including accountability for atrocities and cessation of malign regional behavior.
- Revitalizing agricultural partnerships is **not applicable**. U.S. agricultural policy focuses on providing **humanitarian food assistance** to Syrians in need (via WFP/NGOs) and supporting agricultural livelihoods in areas outside regime control where possible, as part of stabilization efforts. Future large-scale agricultural revitalization would depend on post-conflict reconstruction context.

## 4. Policy Goals

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

- **Past contributions:** None significant in recent decades; historically brief tactical CT cooperation.
- **What we would like in the future (requires fundamental change):** End internal conflict/repression; cease being platform for Iran/Russia; cooperate on counter-ISIS; allow refugee return; engage in credible political transition (UNSCR 2254); cease Captagon production/trafficking; respect neighbors' sovereignty. Currently acts counter to U.S. goals.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

- **Needs (Syrian people):** End of conflict/violence; massive humanitarian aid; political transition to legitimate governance; accountability for atrocities; reconstruction/recovery support; safe refugee return conditions; withdrawal of malign foreign forces.
- **Needs (Assad regime):** Regime survival; international re-legitimization; sanctions relief; reconstruction funding without conditions; consolidation of control; continued support from Russia/Iran. (U.S. cannot meet regime needs).

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

- Implement a **"Strategy of Pressure, Stabilization, and Political Horizon for Syria"**:
    1.  **Maintain Pressure on Assad Regime:** Enforce comprehensive sanctions (Caesar Act); oppose normalization efforts lacking political progress; support international accountability mechanisms (IIIM, potential future tribunal).
    2.  **Counter ISIS:** Maintain limited U.S. military presence in eastern Syria supporting SDF partners for counter-ISIS operations; support stabilization efforts in liberated areas to prevent ISIS resurgence.
    3.  **Alleviate Humanitarian Suffering:** Remain leading provider of humanitarian aid through UN/NGO channels across all parts of Syria based on need; advocate for unimpeded humanitarian access (including cross-border aid).
    4.  **Support Political Solution:** Reinvigorate diplomatic efforts supporting UN Special Envoy and implementation of UNSCR 2254; engage key regional/international actors (Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Gulf states, Europe) to align approaches; maintain dialogue with Syrian opposition.
    5.  **Counter Malign Influence:** Work with partners to counter Iranian entrenchment and Russian influence; interdict illicit regime financing (Captagon trade); manage deconfliction with Russia carefully.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

- **Achieve a durable ceasefire** nationwide.
- **Advance a political solution** based on UNSCR 2254, leading to inclusive, legitimate governance.
- **Ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS**.
- **Promote accountability** for atrocities and human rights violations.
- **Address the humanitarian crisis** and support conditions for safe, voluntary refugee return eventually.
- **Counter Iranian/Russian malign influence** and threats emanating from Syria.
- **Maintain international consensus** on non-normalization with Assad regime absent political progress.

**Economic Strategies:**

- **Maintain and enforce comprehensive sanctions** targeting the Assad regime and its supporters.
- **Provide humanitarian assistance** and early recovery/stabilization support in areas outside regime control.
- **Block reconstruction assistance** that benefits the regime without political progress.
- **Work with partners to counter illicit regime financing** (Captagon trade).
- **Support long-term economic recovery planning** contingent on political transition.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**

- **Assessment:** Health system devastated by conflict. Severe shortages of staff, medicines, equipment. Vulnerable to outbreaks (cholera). Access minimal in many areas.
- **Opportunities:** Provide emergency health aid via UN/NGOs. Support basic services (vaccinations) where access permits. Long-term rebuilding requires political solution/reconstruction.
- **U.S. Wants:** Prevent major epidemics; alleviate suffering; support basic health access.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Fund humanitarian health partners; coordinate with WHO; support cross-border health aid delivery mechanisms.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**

- **Evaluation:** Largest refugee crisis globally. Millions hosted by neighbors (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq) straining resources. Millions internally displaced. Regime obstructs safe return. Borders porous/contested.
- **Impact:** Major source of regional instability; burden on host countries; driver of migration towards Europe.
- **Response:** Provide major humanitarian support to refugees/IDPs and host communities. Insist on conditions for safe, voluntary, dignified refugee return (UNHCR principles). Support border management capacity of neighbors where appropriate. Maintain pressure on regime regarding return conditions.
- **U.S. Wants:** Alleviate suffering; support host countries; prevent forced return; eventually enable safe voluntary return based on political solution.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Humanitarian aid; diplomatic engagement with host countries/UNHCR; maintain pressure on regime; support political process as only sustainable solution.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**

- **Assessment:** Regime deeply corrupt, institutions serve regime survival. Governance non-existent/predatory in many areas. Lack of transparency total.
- **Measures:** Sanction corrupt regime figures/networks. Support accountability efforts. Promote transparency in aid delivery. Support governance strengthening in areas outside regime control where feasible.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**

- **Analysis:** Regime participates in UN but lacks legitimacy. Readmitted to Arab League but normalization stalled. Relies on Russia/Iran support.
- **Leverage:** Work within UN Security Council (countering Russian vetoes where possible) to maintain focus on UNSCR 2254/humanitarian access/accountability. Coordinate with like-minded partners (Small Group, EU, key regional states). Oppose regime's full reintegration absent political progress.

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**

- **Issues:** Catastrophic situation across all human rights categories due to regime actions and conflict dynamics. Impunity for mass atrocities is norm.
- **Influence:** Lead efforts on international **accountability** (support IIIM, potential future justice mechanisms). Provide robust support for **Syrian human rights defenders/civil society** (often in exile/diaspora). Maintain strong **sanctions** targeting human rights abusers. Consistent **public condemnation** of abuses. Ensure humanitarian aid prioritizes most vulnerable.

**Technology & Cyber Cooperation:**

- **Needs (Regime):** Technology for surveillance/repression, potentially circumventing sanctions.
- **Opportunities (U.S.):** None for cooperation. Focus on **preventing regime access** to sensitive technology (export controls, sanctions). Defend against potential Syrian regime/proxy **cyber threats**.
- **U.S. Wants:** Deny regime access to harmful tech; defend against cyber threats.

**Energy Transition & Green Finance:**

- **Roadmap:** Not applicable currently. Country faces basic energy shortages. Reconstruction would need focus on sustainable energy, but requires political settlement first.
- **Opportunities:** None currently. Long-term potential post-conflict.
- **Metrics:** Not applicable.

**Education & Workforce Development:**

- **Status:** Education system devastated. Millions of children out of school. Brain drain severe.
- **Initiatives:** Support emergency education programs for refugees/IDPs (UNICEF, NGOs). Plan for major long-term investment in rebuilding education system as part of recovery. Support diaspora networks preserving human capital.
- **Outcomes:** Mitigate lost generation impact; preserve future potential.

**Health Beyond Pandemics (Noncommunicable Diseases):**

- **Burden:** Data unreliable, but likely high burden exacerbated by conflict/system collapse. Access to care minimal.
- **Collaboration:** Focus on emergency/primary care, infectious disease control first. NCDs secondary priority in acute crisis phase.

**Rule of Law & Judiciary Reform:**

- **Status:** Rule of law non-existent under regime. Justice system tool of repression. Urgent need for complete overhaul post-transition. Accountability for past crimes paramount.
- **Assistance:** Support international accountability mechanisms. Plan for major long-term rule of law/justice sector reform assistance contingent on political transition. Support Syrian legal professionals/activists working on transitional justice.
- **Benchmarks:** Progress in international accountability efforts; future establishment of credible domestic justice processes.

**Supply‑Chain Resilience:**

- **Industries:** Not relevant currently. Historically oil/phosphate exporter. Now source of illicit Captagon disrupting regional supply chains/security.
- **Incentives:** Focus on **countering Captagon trade** through regional cooperation, sanctions, interdiction efforts.

**Diaspora & Remittance Flows:**

- **Diaspora:** Massive global diaspora (refugees, earlier emigrants). Remittances important for survival for many inside Syria. Diaspora politically active (opposition groups, civil society).
- **Engagement:** Engage constructively with diverse diaspora groups. Support diaspora civil society/media. Facilitate humanitarian remittances where possible while preventing regime diversion. Leverage diaspora expertise for future recovery planning.

**Cultural Heritage & Soft Power:**

- **Assets:** Syria possesses immense, ancient cultural heritage (Palmyra, Aleppo, Damascus - many sites damaged/destroyed). Rich history/culture.
- **Programs:** Support efforts to document/protect cultural heritage where possible (UNESCO, NGOs). Condemn destruction/looting. Plan for post-conflict preservation/restoration support. Use public diplomacy to express solidarity with Syrian people/culture distinct from regime.

**Tariff Report:**

- Extensive U.S. sanctions, including the **Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act**, severely restrict trade and financial transactions with the Syrian regime and affiliated entities. Most trade is prohibited, with exceptions primarily for humanitarian purposes licensed by OFAC.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- The U.S. has resettled tens of thousands of Syrian refugees since 2011, although numbers decreased significantly under previous administration policies. Syrians can also apply for asylum. Specific parole programs may exist. Significant Syrian-American community exists from earlier immigration waves.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens **require a visa** to enter Syria. However, the U.S. Department of State has a **"Level 4: Do Not Travel" advisory** for Syria due to terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and risk of wrongful detention. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended operations in 2012; no consular services are available within Syria. Travel is extremely dangerous and strongly discouraged.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Non-existent under the Assad regime. Systematic, widespread, and gross human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been documented by UN and human rights organizations.
- **Affected Groups:** The entire civilian population has been affected. Specific targets include political opponents, protesters, human rights defenders, journalists, medical workers, ethnic/religious groups perceived as disloyal, residents of opposition-held areas, returning refugees, detainees. Arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings are endemic. Use of chemical weapons documented.
- **Suppressed Rights:** All fundamental rights are suppressed by the regime – freedom of expression, assembly, association, movement, right to life, liberty, fair trial, freedom from torture are systematically violated.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Lead international efforts to **document atrocities and promote accountability** (support IIIM, sanctions on perpetrators, potential future justice mechanisms). Provide **humanitarian aid** based on need. Maintain **diplomatic isolation and economic pressure** on the regime. Support a **political solution based on UNSCR 2254** that includes transitional governance, constitutional reform, and free elections. Support **Syrian civil society and human rights defenders**. Advocate strongly for **protection of civilians** and unimpeded **humanitarian access**.
