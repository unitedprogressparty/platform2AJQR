# **Oman: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States maintains a strategic partnership with Oman, characterized by mutual interests in security, trade, and cultural exchange. Oman has been a reliable ally in the Middle East, playing a crucial role in regional stability and countering terrorism. Recent events, including Oman's involvement in mediating tensions in Yemen and its ongoing commitment to maintaining neutral diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, affirm its position as a key player in the region. The U.S. is interested in deepening cooperation with Oman, particularly in areas such as energy security, counterterrorism, and trade.

### **Crises**:

Oman faces several crises, both internal and regional, that could impact its stability and relationship with the U.S. Firstly, the ongoing conflict in Yemen poses a significant challenge, as Oman shares a border with Yemen and has been involved in mediation efforts to quell the violence. The humanitarian crisis resulting from the conflict has strained resources and led to increased migration pressures on Oman, which could lead to social unrest if not managed effectively. 

Additionally, the region has witnessed heightened tensions involving Iran, with concerns over Tehran's influence in the Gulf. Oman has historically maintained a neutral stance in regional conflicts, but it must navigate the delicate balance of its relationships with both Iran and Saudi Arabia. This precarious situation poses risks of spillover violence or destabilization within Oman, particularly if regional conflicts escalate.

Economically, Oman is dealing with the ramifications of fluctuating oil prices, which heavily impact its economy. The reliance on oil revenue has made Oman vulnerable to external economic shocks, and the government is striving to diversify its economy through initiatives like Vision 2040. However, the transition to a more diversified economy may face hurdles, including potential internal dissent from citizens expecting immediate economic relief.

Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges, impacting public health and economic stability. As Oman continues to recover from the pandemic, it must address the long-term effects on its healthcare system and workforce, further complicating its internal dynamics and overall stability.

**Frank Narrative** 

Oman plays a crucial role in the Middle East, acting as a stabilizing force amidst ongoing regional tensions. Its strategic location along vital shipping routes in the Arabian Sea enhances its importance to global trade and U.S. interests in energy security. The U.S. values Oman's ability to serve as a mediator in regional conflicts, particularly in Yemen, where its efforts have aimed to facilitate peace talks and humanitarian assistance. This diplomatic engagement not only helps mitigate the humanitarian crisis but also reinforces Oman's position as a responsible actor in the region. The U.S. seeks to further empower Oman in these roles by providing diplomatic support and resources.

In terms of economic cooperation, Oman is a critical partner for the U.S. in the Gulf region. The two countries have engaged in trade agreements that promote mutual economic interests, particularly in the energy sector. As Oman seeks to diversify its economy away from oil dependency, the U.S. can offer technological assistance and investment opportunities in renewable energy and infrastructure projects. This collaboration would not only strengthen Oman's economic resilience but also align with U.S. objectives of promoting sustainable development.

Oman's internal governance challenges, particularly regarding human rights and political reforms, represent an area where U.S. engagement could be beneficial. By promoting good governance and transparency, the U.S. can help foster a more stable environment conducive to economic growth and social cohesion. This approach aligns with U.S. values and interests in promoting democracy and human rights in the region.

Finally, as climate change poses increasing risks to regional stability, Oman must address environmental challenges that could exacerbate existing tensions. The U.S. can collaborate with Oman on joint initiatives aimed at tackling climate change and promoting sustainable practices. This partnership not only addresses immediate environmental concerns but also strengthens the bilateral relationship by demonstrating a shared commitment to addressing global challenges.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Oman is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, sharing borders with the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest. It has a population of approximately 5 million people, with a GDP of around $76 billion as of 2022. The country's economy is primarily based on oil exports, which account for a significant portion of its GDP. However, Oman has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons and improve quality of life for its citizens. The country's Freedom Index score reflects a moderate level of personal and political freedoms, with the ruling Sultanate maintaining a degree of autocratic governance while allowing some limited political participation.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Oman's strategic location along the Strait of Hormuz, a vital passageway for global oil shipments, highlights its importance to U.S. and global energy security. The country has historically maintained a neutral foreign policy, facilitating diplomatic relations with both Western and Arab nations. Its role as a mediator in regional conflicts, particularly in Yemen, underscores Oman's potential to contribute to regional stability and U.S. strategic interests in counterterrorism efforts and maritime security.

**Democracy Score:**

Oman is governed by a Sultan, currently Haitham bin Tariq, who succeeded Sultan Qaboos in 2020. The political landscape is characterized by limited democratic freedoms, with the ruling party exerting significant control over governance. While there are elected advisory councils, their powers are limited, and the Sultan has the ultimate authority. The lack of political pluralism and restrictions on freedom of expression remain significant challenges to Oman's democratic development.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S.-Oman relationship has evolved over several decades, marked by key milestones such as the signing of the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement in 2006. The agreement aimed to strengthen economic ties and promote trade between the two nations. Additionally, Oman's role as a mediator in regional conflicts has been recognized by the U.S. as a valuable asset in promoting stability in the Gulf region.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Oman has historically maintained a neutral stance in regional conflicts, allowing it to serve as a facilitator for peace talks. The U.S. and Oman have collaborated on various security agreements, including arms sales and joint military exercises, to enhance regional security. Despite a generally positive relationship, there have been tensions surrounding human rights issues and governance practices in Oman, which the U.S. has raised in diplomatic discussions.

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

The U.S. proposes to enhance bilateral cooperation through a comprehensive partnership framework that includes joint initiatives in security, economic diversification, and climate change. This framework will outline specific areas of collaboration, ensuring that both nations benefit from shared goals and interests.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

The U.S. aims to strengthen alliances with Oman while managing relationships with regional adversaries. Promoting democratic values, human rights, and good governance will be central to U.S. diplomatic objectives in Oman.

Expanding trade and investment opportunities, particularly in renewable energy and technology sectors, will be a priority. The U.S. will encourage sustainable development initiatives that align with Oman's economic diversification goals.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**

Oman has faced challenges in its public health system, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. can assist Oman in strengthening healthcare infrastructure and pandemic preparedness through collaborative efforts in research and vaccine distribution. This partnership will enhance public health outcomes and build resilience against future health crises.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**
