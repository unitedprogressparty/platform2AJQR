# **Chad: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Chad has been a pivotal player in the Sahel region, marked by its strategic location and resources. The relationship between the United States and Chad has seen fluctuations, particularly influenced by Chad's role in regional security and counterterrorism efforts. Recently, Chad has faced significant political instability following the death of President Idriss Déby in April 2021, leading to a transitional military council taking charge. The U.S. has continued to support Chad in its fight against terrorism, especially against Boko Haram and other extremist groups in the region. However, ongoing internal conflicts and humanitarian crises have complicated this relationship, necessitating a comprehensive approach to U.S. foreign policy in Chad.

### **Crises:**

Chad is currently grappling with a series of crises, primarily stemming from political instability and security threats. The transitional government, established after President Déby’s death, faces challenges in maintaining control and legitimacy. The political landscape is further complicated by rising tensions among various ethnic groups and political factions, increasing the risk of civil unrest. Moreover, Chad's involvement in regional conflicts, particularly its engagement in the fight against Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, exacerbates internal pressures, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has displaced millions within and beyond its borders.

The humanitarian situation in Chad remains dire, marked by food insecurity and limited access to health services. According to the United Nations, approximately 5.5 million people in Chad are in need of humanitarian assistance, with malnutrition rates reaching alarming levels, particularly among children. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the country's already fragile healthcare system, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. As a result, international aid and support have become critical in addressing these pressing needs.

In addition to these challenges, Chad is experiencing threats from various rebel groups that continue to operate in the region. The Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) and other insurgent movements have launched attacks against government forces, raising concerns about the potential for wider violence and instability. The presence of these groups threatens not only Chad's internal security but also the broader stability of the Sahel region, which is already facing challenges from terrorism and organized crime.

Looking ahead, Chad faces the risk of escalating violence and political fragmentation, particularly if the transitional government fails to address the underlying grievances of its population. Additionally, the ongoing threat of climate change, which affects agricultural productivity and exacerbates resource scarcity, poses a long-term challenge to stability in Chad. The international community, including the United States, must carefully navigate these complexities to support Chad in achieving a more stable and peaceful future.

**Frank Narrative**

Chad's strategic importance to U.S. foreign policy is underscored by its role as a partner in combatting terrorism in the Sahel region. The U.S. has recognized Chad's contributions to regional security, particularly its military's efforts in countering Boko Haram and other extremist groups. The Chadian military has been instrumental in supporting multinational forces aimed at stabilizing the Lake Chad Basin and preventing the spread of violent extremism. In return, the U.S. has provided military aid and training to enhance Chad's defense capabilities. This partnership is vital for the U.S. as it seeks to promote stability in a region that has become increasingly volatile due to the influence of militant groups.

In the future, the U.S. seeks to build on this partnership by encouraging Chad to embrace democratic reforms and improve governance. The transitional government must prioritize political inclusivity and address the grievances of marginalized communities to prevent further unrest. The U.S. can facilitate this process by providing technical assistance and support for democratic institutions, which will foster a more stable political environment conducive to economic development. This approach aligns with U.S. interests in promoting democracy and human rights globally.

Chad also requires support in addressing pressing domestic challenges, particularly in the realms of economic diversification and humanitarian assistance. The country heavily relies on oil exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. U.S. investment in sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, and infrastructure can help diversify Chad's economy and reduce its dependence on oil. Additionally, the U.S. can play a pivotal role in mobilizing international aid to address the humanitarian crisis, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the support they need.

Furthermore, Chad's geographical position makes it a key player in regional diplomacy and stability. The U.S. should leverage Chad's influence within regional organizations to promote collaborative efforts in addressing shared challenges, such as migration, security, and economic development. By fostering multilateral cooperation, the U.S. can help Chad become a more effective mediator in regional conflicts, enhancing its role as a stabilizing force in the Sahel.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Chad is a landlocked country located in north-central Africa, bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, and Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest. With a population of approximately 16 million people, Chad has a diverse ethnic makeup and a political system characterized by a transitional government. The country’s GDP is estimated at around $11 billion, with oil being the primary driver of its economy. However, Chad faces significant challenges in terms of quality of life, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking among the lowest globally. Freedom House scores Chad low on political rights and civil liberties, indicating limited democratic freedoms and human rights protections.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Chad's strategic location in the Sahel region makes it a critical player in regional security and stability. The country serves as a buffer against the spread of terrorism and extremism from neighboring countries, particularly Mali and Nigeria. Chad's military has been involved in various peacekeeping missions and counterterrorism operations, making it an essential ally for the U.S. in its efforts to combat terrorism in Africa. Additionally, Chad’s natural resources, including oil and minerals, contribute to its economic significance in the region.

**Democracy Score:**

Chad's political landscape is characterized by a lack of democratic governance and significant challenges to human rights. The ruling military council has faced criticism for suppressing dissent and failing to hold free and fair elections. Although the transitional government has promised to restore civilian rule, the actual governance practices remain inconsistent with democratic ideals. Currently, the Transitional Military Council, led by Mahamat Idriss Déby, is in charge, and there are concerns about its commitment to genuine democratic reforms.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**

The U.S.-Chad relationship has evolved over the years, shaped by key historical events. In 2003, Chad became a major ally in the fight against terrorism following the events of 9/11, leading to increased military cooperation. In 2010, the U.S. recognized Chad's contributions to regional security by designating it as a “major non-NATO ally.” However, relations have been strained at times due to concerns about human rights abuses and governance issues.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

The U.S. and Chad have collaborated on various security agreements, including joint military training and humanitarian assistance programs. The bilateral relationship, however, has faced challenges due to Chad’s internal conflicts and governance issues. While the U.S. has provided military support to Chad, it has also raised concerns about human rights violations and the need for democratic reforms.

### **2. Strategic Importance**

**Economic Interests:**

**Trade Relationships:**

Chad's trade relationships are primarily focused on oil exports, which account for a significant portion of its revenue. The U.S. has invested in Chad's oil sector, with major American companies involved in exploration and production. However, trade imbalances and reliance on oil make the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. Diversifying trade partnerships with countries in the region and beyond is essential for economic stability.

**Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**

Chad possesses valuable natural resources, including oil, gold, and uranium. The U.S. should encourage Chad to diversify its economy by investing in agriculture and renewable energy. Partnerships in these sectors can enhance economic resilience and reduce dependence on oil. Additionally, fostering regional trade agreements can strengthen economic ties and promote stability.

**Security & Defense:**

**Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**

Chad faces significant security threats from terrorist groups, particularly Boko Haram and various rebel factions. The Chadian military has been actively involved in counterterrorism operations, but the persistent threat of violence undermines stability. The U.S. should continue to support Chad in addressing these security concerns through military assistance and intelligence sharing.

**Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**

The U.S. and Chad have established military cooperation through training programs and joint operations. This partnership has been instrumental in enhancing Chad's capacity to combat terrorism and maintain regional security. Future collaboration should focus on building Chad’s military capabilities and ensuring effective governance within the security forces.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

**Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**

Chad plays a vital role in regional diplomacy, engaging in peacekeeping missions and collaborating with neighboring countries to address security challenges. The U.S. should leverage Chad's diplomatic influence to promote stability and cooperation in the Sahel region.

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**

Chad's participation in regional organizations, such as the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), provides opportunities for multilateral cooperation. The U.S. can support Chad's efforts to mediate regional conflicts and promote dialogue among stakeholders.

**Economic Strategies:**

Expanding trade and investment opportunities in Chad is essential for mutual benefit. The U.S. should encourage sustainable development initiatives and technological cooperation to enhance economic resilience and stability.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**  
Chad's public health system faces significant challenges, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. should collaborate with Chad to improve healthcare infrastructure, support vaccine distribution efforts, and enhance pandemic preparedness. This cooperation can include technical assistance and funding for healthcare programs, ensuring that Chad is better equipped to respond to future health crises.
