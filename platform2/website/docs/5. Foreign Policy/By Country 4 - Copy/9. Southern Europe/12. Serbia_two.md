# **Serbia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Serbia have a complex and often challenging relationship, shaped by the legacy of the Balkan wars of the 1990s (including the 1999 NATO intervention over Kosovo), Serbia's unresolved relationship with Kosovo, its close ties with Russia, and concerns regarding democratic backsliding and malign influence in the region. While the U.S. supports Serbia's stated goal of EU integration and seeks a stable, prosperous, and democratic Serbia integrated into European structures, progress is hindered by these persistent issues. Current relations are **transactional and cautious**, characterized by U.S. efforts to encourage Serbia's alignment with Euro-Atlantic norms, support for the EU-facilitated dialogue with Kosovo aimed at normalization, cooperation on specific issues like counterterrorism, and concerns about Serbia's foreign policy orientation (especially regarding Russia and China) and internal democratic health. The U.S. views Serbia as a key country for the stability of the Western Balkans, but its close relationship with Russia and stance on Kosovo remain major obstacles to a deeper partnership.

### **Crises**

Serbia faces several interconnected challenges and potential crises. The most significant is the **unresolved status of Kosovo** and the resulting **political crisis** in relations with Pristina and the wider region. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence, and tensions frequently flare, particularly concerning the rights and status of the Serb minority in northern Kosovo. The failure to achieve normalization through the EU-facilitated dialogue perpetuates instability, hinders both countries' EU aspirations, and carries a risk of renewed conflict or localized violence (as seen in incidents like Banjska 2023). This dispute remains the central obstacle to regional stability.

Domestically, Serbia faces concerns regarding **democratic backsliding and rule of law**. Under President Aleksandar Vučić and the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), there has been erosion of media freedom, pressure on civil society and opposition, concerns about electoral integrity, and state capture/corruption issues. While Serbia is an EU candidate country, progress on democratic reforms required for accession has been slow and sometimes reversed, creating friction with the EU and U.S.

Regionally, Serbia's close **political, military, and energy ties with Russia** pose a significant challenge, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia, maintains close relations with Moscow, and is susceptible to Russian disinformation and malign influence, undermining regional alignment with Euro-Atlantic partners. Serbia's influence in neighboring countries with significant Serb populations (Bosnia and Herzegovina - Republika Srpska, Montenegro, northern Kosovo) can also be a source of regional tension if used to promote nationalist agendas or undermine neighbors' sovereignty.

Economically, while Serbia has experienced growth, challenges remain related to **structural reforms**, improving the business climate, reducing the state's role in the economy, and addressing **emigration** of skilled labor. **Energy dependence** on Russia (historically for gas) is also a vulnerability, though diversification efforts are underway.

Anticipated future crises include potential **escalation of tensions with Kosovo**, failure of the EU dialogue leading to prolonged stalemate or instability, further **democratic backsliding** internally leading to greater political polarization or unrest, increased **Russian/Chinese influence** undermining Euro-Atlantic integration, or **economic shocks**. Managing these risks while advancing towards EU integration is Serbia's primary challenge.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Serbia's potential contribution to U.S. regional goals in the Western Balkans and Europe is significant but largely unrealized due to current policies and unresolved disputes. Historically, post-Milošević democratic governments in the early 2000s made progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration and regional cooperation, aligning temporarily with U.S. goals. Serbia has cooperated with the U.S. on specific issues like **counterterrorism** (sharing information) and **counter-narcotics**. Serbian forces have also participated in some international **peacekeeping missions** (e.g., UN missions in Africa, EU missions), contributing modestly to global security efforts. Economically, Serbia is the largest economy in the Western Balkans (excluding EU members), and its stability and growth are important for the entire region.

Looking forward, a **democratically reformed Serbia fully aligned with Euro-Atlantic values and integrated into European structures** could significantly advance U.S. goals. The most crucial contribution would be achieving **normalization of relations with Kosovo** through the EU-facilitated dialogue, based on principles acceptable to both sides (ideally leading towards eventual mutual recognition). This would unlock regional stability, allow both countries to advance towards EU membership, and reduce opportunities for external malign influence. Secondly, Serbia could greatly help by **aligning its foreign policy with the EU/U.S.**, particularly by imposing **sanctions on Russia** for its aggression against Ukraine and reducing its dependence on Russia (energy, military, political). This would strengthen European unity and counter Russian influence in the Balkans. Thirdly, genuine progress on **domestic democratic reforms**, strengthening rule of law, ensuring media freedom, and combating corruption would make Serbia a more resilient and reliable partner, serving as a positive model for neighbors. Fourthly, Serbia could play a highly constructive role in promoting **regional stability and reconciliation**, using its influence positively in Bosnia and Herzegovina (supporting state integrity rather than secessionist elements in Republika Srpska) and Montenegro. Concrete actions would include implementing Kosovo dialogue agreements, joining EU sanctions on Russia, undertaking verifiable democratic reforms (meeting EU accession criteria), and adopting constructive regional policies. Accountability would involve monitoring progress through the EU accession process, conditions tied to U.S./EU assistance, and regular bilateral dialogue assessing alignment on key issues.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Serbia needs a clear and consistent message from the U.S. and the international community regarding the path towards **Euro-Atlantic integration** and the requirements for achieving it. This includes sustained **diplomatic support for the EU accession process**, coupled with clear expectations regarding necessary reforms, particularly on **democracy, rule of law, and normalization with Kosovo**. Technical assistance from the U.S. (USAID, DOJ/INL) and EU (IPA funds) is needed to support these reforms, focusing on judicial independence, anti-corruption efforts, media freedom, and electoral integrity. Benchmarks should be tied to EU accession chapters and independent monitoring reports (e.g., from OSCE/ODIHR, Council of Europe).

Serbia requires international support, primarily through the **EU-facilitated dialogue**, to reach a **sustainable normalization agreement with Kosovo**. This necessitates balanced pressure on both parties to implement existing agreements and negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive settlement. The U.S. role in supporting the EU mediator and engaging directly with Belgrade and Pristina is crucial. Serbia needs assurances regarding the protection of **Kosovo Serb community rights** within any final agreement, potentially through international guarantees or mechanisms established under the dialogue (like the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities).

Economically, Serbia needs continued **integration into European markets**, foreign direct investment (U.S., EU, others), and support for **structural reforms** to boost competitiveness and create jobs. Assistance is needed for **energy diversification** away from Russian gas, including support for regional interconnectors (e.g., gas pipeline with Bulgaria, potentially LNG access), renewable energy development, and energy efficiency improvements. U.S. investment (DFC potential) and technology transfer in these areas would be beneficial. Support from IFIs (World Bank, EBRD, EIB) for infrastructure development (transport, energy, digital) is also important.

Serbia needs support in countering **external malign influence** (disinformation, hybrid threats), potentially through U.S./NATO/EU technical assistance and capacity building for cybersecurity, strategic communications, and media literacy. Finally, Serbia needs pathways for **regional reconciliation** and addressing legacies of the 1990s wars, including cooperation with regional partners and international justice mechanisms (like the Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague).

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - U.S. establishes relations with Serbia (1882). Allied in WWI. Part of Yugoslavia post-WWI.
  - **Cold War:** Yugoslavia under Tito pursues non-aligned path, relations with U.S. vary.
  - **1990s:** Dissolution of Yugoslavia. Serbia under Milošević involved in wars in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo. U.S./NATO oppose Serbian actions, impose sanctions, intervene militarily in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo/Serbia (1999). Relations extremely poor.
  - **2000:** Overthrow of Milošević ("Bulldozer Revolution"). Democratic government takes power. U.S. strongly supports democratic transition, provides major assistance, lifts sanctions. Relations improve dramatically.
  - **2006:** Montenegro separates; Serbia becomes independent republic.
  - **2008:** Kosovo declares independence; Serbia strongly opposes, supported by Russia. U.S. recognizes Kosovo, straining relations with Serbia.
  - **Post-2008:** U.S. supports Serbia's EU path while also supporting Kosovo's sovereignty. Engages Serbia through assistance programs (democracy, economy) and supports EU-led Kosovo dialogue. Relations remain complex due to Kosovo issue and Serbia's ties with Russia.
  - **Post-2022:** Serbia condemns Ukraine invasion at UN but refuses to join sanctions on Russia, maintaining close ties, further complicating relations with U.S./EU.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - Adversaries during 1999 NATO intervention. Periods of partnership post-2000 focused on democratic transition/EU integration.
  - Key agreements include USAID development assistance frameworks, cooperation MOUs on law enforcement/counterterrorism, participation in NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program (though cooperation limited), Open Skies Treaty (U.S. withdrew). Serbia has SAA with EU.
  - Bilateral relations are **complex and often strained**, primarily due to the Kosovo dispute and Serbia's relationship with Russia, despite shared interests in regional stability and Serbia's stated goal of EU membership.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Significant concerns regarding **democratic backsliding**: erosion of media freedom (state influence, harassment of independent journalists), pressure on civil society/opposition, concerns about electoral fairness, lack of progress on rule of law reforms (judicial independence, anti-corruption).
  - U.S./EU consistently raise these issues, linking progress to EU accession prospects. U.S. provides assistance supporting independent media, civil society, judicial reform.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - SNS party under President Vučić maintains dominant political control, ensuring policy continuity focused on balancing EU path with close Russia/China ties, maintaining stance on Kosovo, attracting FDI. Opposition fragmented. Stability maintained through state control, but democratic quality eroded.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
  - Council of Europe
  - World Trade Organization (WTO) (Observer, accession pending)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
  - NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP)
  - U.S.-Serbia bilateral agreements (e.g., SOFA for exercises, cooperation MOUs on law enforcement, science/tech, culture)
  - Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)
  - Various international conventions (climate, biodiversity, human rights - though implementation concerns, NPT, etc.)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Concerns focus on **structural reforms** needed for EU accession/sustained growth (rule of law, state enterprises, business climate). Serbia's **refusal to join sanctions on Russia** creates political/economic friction with U.S./EU. Growing **Chinese economic influence** (debt, standards) is concern. No major U.S. sanctions on Serbia itself (some individuals sanctioned related to corruption/Kosovo).
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Opportunities lie in supporting Serbia's **EU accession process** and associated reforms. Promoting **U.S. investment** (DFC potential) conditional on improved governance/rule of law. Supporting **energy diversification** (renewables, interconnectors). Enhancing cooperation within regional frameworks (CEFTA, potentially Open Balkan if revived constructively).

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - **Kosovo dispute** is primary source of tension. Serbia's influence in Bosnia (Republika Srpska) impacts regional stability. Close ties with **Russia** create major geopolitical friction with U.S./EU, especially post-Ukraine invasion. Balancing act between West, Russia, China defines foreign policy. Military neutrality maintained.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Low direct terrorism risk. Risk of **escalation with Kosovo** remains significant concern. High exposure to **Russian hybrid warfare** (disinformation, potentially cyber). Need to enhance national **cybersecurity** capacity.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Serbia source of emigration (brain drain to Western Europe). Transit country for migration on Balkan route. Hosts some refugees. Significant Serbian diaspora globally (including U.S.). U.S. cultural influence present but competes with strong Russian cultural/media influence. Public opinion complex, often skeptical of West (legacy of 1999 bombing), influenced by pro-Russian narratives in media, though EU membership remains stated goal/popular aspiration for many. Active U.S. exchange programs (Fulbright, youth programs).
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Shared European cultural heritage. Strong national identity, Orthodox Christian tradition influential. Divergence on democratic values implementation, foreign policy alignment (Russia ties). Debates on historical narratives (Yugoslav wars, Kosovo).

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Serbia vulnerable to droughts, floods, heatwaves impacting agriculture/water resources/health. Air pollution (from coal, industry, heating) major problem in cities. Needs significant investment in environmental protection/energy transition. U.S. interest in regional stability, health, supporting EU green agenda alignment.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Support Serbia's **energy transition** away from coal towards renewables (hydro, wind, solar potential) and energy efficiency. Requires major investment/reform (EU funds, IFIs key). Cooperate on air quality improvement, water management. U.S. technology/investment could play role if conditions right.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Air pollution causes health problems/public discontent. Water resource management (shared rivers) requires regional cooperation. Failure to align with EU Green Deal hinders accession.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have pursued a **transactional deal on Kosovo**, potentially prioritizing speed over substance or U.S. interests over EU alignment, possibly pressuring both sides towards unpopular compromises (similar to Washington Agreements logic).
- Emphasis on democracy/rule of law concerns might decrease. Approach towards Serbia's ties with Russia could be less critical or inconsistent. Support for multilateral Balkan initiatives might weaken.
- Impact could be unpredictable shifts in U.S. policy towards Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, potentially undermining EU efforts and creating confusion/instability, though focus on economic deals might continue.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, U.S. should **reaffirm strong support for EU-led Kosovo-Serbia dialogue** based on comprehensive normalization. Re-commit to coordinating closely with EU partners on Western Balkans policy. Restore emphasis on democracy, rule of law, media freedom as central to bilateral relationship and EU path.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Serbia Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture and EU Standards Alignment"**:
    - **Modernization & Competitiveness:** Provide technical assistance (USAID, USDA) and promote investment (DFC potential) in modernizing Serbian agriculture (irrigation, storage, processing), improving food safety standards to meet EU requirements, and developing value chains for key exports (fruits, grains, vegetables).
    - **Climate Resilience & Environment:** Collaborate on climate-smart agriculture practices, sustainable water management, reducing agricultural pollution (aligning with EU Green Deal). Support organic farming development.
    - **Market Access:** Work within regional (CEFTA) and EU accession frameworks to improve market access for Serbian agricultural products. Facilitate linkages between U.S./Serbian agribusinesses.
- Utilize existing bilateral dialogues and EU accession structures to coordinate agricultural cooperation, monitor progress, and address regulatory issues.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. support for Serbian agriculture modernization and EU integration path. Expand exchanges for farmers, researchers, students (Fulbright, university links).

- U.S. citizens can travel to Serbia **visa-free** for tourist or business stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. A valid U.S. passport is required.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Constitutional guarantees exist but implementation is weak due to democratic backsliding and rule of law deficits. Political pressure on judiciary/media undermines protections.
- **Affected Groups:** **Independent journalists** (threats, harassment, lawsuits, biased media market), **civil society activists** (pressure, smear campaigns), **political opposition** (unequal playing field, limited media access), **LGBTQ+ individuals** (discrimination, lack of legal recognition, Pride parade often faces threats/bans), **ethnic minorities** (in specific regions), and citizens impacted by **corruption** or lack of **judicial redress**. Accountability for **war crimes** from 1990s remains incomplete.
- **Suppressed Rights:** **Freedom of expression and media freedom** are under significant pressure. **Freedom of assembly** sometimes restricted for critical groups. **Right to fair trial** compromised by political influence/inefficiency. Lack of **accountability** for abuses/corruption.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Make human rights and democracy central to bilateral engagement and conditionality for EU accession support/U.S. partnership. Provide robust support for **independent media, civil society, and human rights defenders**. Consistently raise concerns about media freedom, rule of law, minority rights in diplomatic channels. Use targeted tools (sanctions) against individuals responsible for significant corruption or undermining democracy where appropriate. Support transitional justice processes and regional reconciliation. Coordinate closely with EU on human rights/democracy benchmarks.
