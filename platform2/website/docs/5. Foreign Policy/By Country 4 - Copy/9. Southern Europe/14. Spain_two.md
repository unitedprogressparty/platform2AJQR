# **Spain: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Kingdom of Spain share a strong, multifaceted relationship based on deep historical and cultural ties, shared democratic values, significant economic links, and a robust security partnership through NATO. As a major European Union member state and a key player in the Mediterranean and Ibero-American worlds, Spain is an important U.S. ally. The relationship encompasses close defense cooperation, including U.S. access to critical military bases in Spain (Rota, Morón), collaboration on counterterrorism and regional security (particularly in North Africa and the Sahel), substantial trade and investment, and coordination on a wide range of global issues. Current relations are **strong and cooperative**, marked by alignment on supporting Ukraine, strengthening NATO's southern flank, managing migration flows, promoting democracy in Latin America, and addressing shared challenges like climate change and cybersecurity. High-level engagement is regular, reinforcing the strategic partnership.

### **Crises**

Spain faces several domestic and regional challenges. Domestically, **political fragmentation** and regional tensions, particularly concerning **Catalan separatism**, remain ongoing challenges to national unity and stable governance, although tensions have eased somewhat compared to the peak crisis in 2017. Managing coalition governments often requires complex negotiations. Economically, Spain grapples with relatively **high structural unemployment** (especially among youth), regional economic disparities, and the long-term challenge of adapting its economy for sustainable growth, particularly in areas like digitalization and green transition, supported by EU recovery funds.

Regionally, Spain is significantly impacted by instability in **North Africa (Maghreb)**, particularly concerning migration flows from Morocco and Algeria, disputes over Western Sahara (where Spain has complex historical ties), and potential security threats emanating from the Sahel region further south. Managing relations with Morocco, including cooperation on migration control and counterterrorism amidst occasional diplomatic tensions (e.g., related to Western Sahara or Spanish enclaves Ceuta/Melilla), is a constant challenge. Spain is also a frontline state for **irregular migration** across the Western Mediterranean and Atlantic routes (towards the Canary Islands), requiring significant resources for border management, search and rescue, and reception.

Like other Southern European countries, Spain is highly vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, including severe heatwaves, droughts, water scarcity, desertification risks, and wildfires, posing significant long-term environmental and economic crises.

Anticipated future crises could include renewed **political tensions** related to Catalan separatism or government instability. **Economic shocks** or failure to effectively utilize EU recovery funds could hinder growth and exacerbate unemployment. Worsening **instability in North Africa or the Sahel** could lead to increased migration pressures or security threats. **Climate change impacts** are expected to intensify, requiring significant adaptation efforts. Maintaining social cohesion while managing migration and economic pressures remains a key challenge.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Spain is a vital partner for achieving U.S. strategic objectives in Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Latin America. Its most critical contribution is through its role as a **key NATO ally on the southern flank**. Spain hosts crucial **U.S. military bases** – Naval Station Rota (homeport for U.S. Navy destroyers part of European missile defense, key logistics hub for Africa/Middle East) and Morón Air Base (air mobility hub) – which are indispensable for U.S. power projection, crisis response, and maritime security operations across vast regions. Spain actively contributes forces to **NATO missions** (e.g., air policing in Baltics, maritime patrols, historically in Afghanistan/Iraq) and participates in Alliance exercises, strengthening collective defense. Secondly, Spain plays a significant role in **Mediterranean and North African security**. It cooperates closely with the U.S. and regional partners (especially Morocco) on counterterrorism, counter-narcotics, and managing migration flows. Its proximity and historical ties give it unique insights and influence in the Maghreb. Spain also contributes to EU security missions in the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa, complementing U.S. stabilization efforts. Thirdly, as a major **EU member state**, Spain helps shape EU policies and promotes transatlantic cooperation on issues ranging from sanctions against Russia to digital regulation and climate action. Fourthly, Spain leverages its deep **historical, cultural, and linguistic ties with Latin America** to promote democracy, human rights, and sustainable development in the region, often aligning with and supporting U.S. objectives. It serves as an important bridge between Europe and Latin America.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Spain's continued and enhanced contributions. Maintaining robust **NATO commitments**, including defense spending (moving towards 2% GDP target) and modernizing its military (especially naval/air capabilities relevant for Mediterranean/Atlantic security), is essential. Continued reliable access to and Spanish investment in **bases at Rota and Morón** is critical. The U.S. encourages Spain to take on greater leadership roles within NATO's southern flank adaptation and potentially contribute more to eastern flank deterrence efforts. Enhanced cooperation on **Mediterranean security**, including intelligence sharing on threats from North Africa/Sahel and joint efforts to stabilize Libya, is needed. Continued partnership on **migration management**, balancing security and humanitarian concerns, is vital. The U.S. seeks Spain's strong voice within the **EU** to maintain transatlantic unity on supporting Ukraine, countering Russian/Chinese influence, and promoting shared values. Leveraging Spain's unique influence in **Latin America** to collectively support democracy and address regional challenges (e.g., Venezuela, Nicaragua, transnational crime) is a key opportunity. Concrete actions could include Spain increasing its naval contributions to NATO maritime groups, co-leading EU initiatives focused on Sahel stability, hosting regional dialogues involving North African/Latin American partners, and aligning investment screening/export controls related to strategic technologies. Accountability is maintained through NATO processes, regular bilateral dialogues (High-Level Defense Dialogue), and EU/G7 coordination.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a major European ally facing regional challenges, Spain's needs from the U.S. and the world center on security cooperation, burden-sharing, economic partnership, and support within multilateral frameworks. A fundamental need is **continued U.S. commitment to European security via NATO**, including the security of the southern flank and the Mediterranean. U.S. military presence hosted by Spain contributes to this, and Spain values the close defense relationship and access to U.S. technology/intelligence it provides. Predictable U.S. leadership in NATO is crucial.

Spain requires significant **international cooperation and burden-sharing on managing migration flows** from Africa. As a primary entry point, it needs robust support from the EU (Frontex operations, financial assistance through AMIF, effective solidarity/relocation mechanisms) and partnerships with countries of origin/transit. U.S. diplomatic support for these efforts, intelligence sharing on trafficking networks, and development aid addressing root causes of migration in Africa are valuable contributions.

Economically, Spain needs a **stable global and European economic environment** for its export-oriented and tourism-dependent economy. It benefits from strong **transatlantic trade and investment** and the **EU single market**. U.S. policies avoiding protectionism and supporting global growth are important. Successful implementation of its **EU-funded National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)** is critical for addressing structural challenges (unemployment, digitalization, green transition), requiring a supportive EU context. Spain also needs international cooperation on **energy security**, particularly diversifying gas supplies (it has large LNG import capacity, receiving U.S. LNG) and accelerating its significant potential in **renewable energy** (solar, wind), requiring investment and technology partnerships.

Diplomatically, Spain needs support for its efforts to promote **stability in the Maghreb and Sahel**, requiring coordinated approaches from the U.S. and EU. It also seeks international partnership in addressing shared challenges in **Latin America**. Support for **multilateralism** and international institutions where Spain plays an active role (UN, EU, OSCE, Union for Mediterranean) is important. Finally, Spain benefits from close **counterterrorism and counter-organized crime cooperation** with the U.S. and European partners, including intelligence sharing and joint investigations.
