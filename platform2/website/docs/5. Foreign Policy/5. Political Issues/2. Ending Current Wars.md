## Prioritizing Diplomacy, Peacebuilding, and Withdrawal from Endless Conflicts

Decades of prolonged U.S. military interventions and "endless wars" in regions like the Middle East and Central Asia have incurred immense human, financial, and strategic costs. These conflicts have often failed to achieve their stated objectives, destabilized regions, fueled extremism, diverted resources from domestic needs, and eroded America's global standing. Continuing these engagements indefinitely is unsustainable and counterproductive.

Our platform advocates for a fundamental shift away from military interventionism towards a foreign policy centered on diplomacy, peacebuilding, and responsible withdrawal from ongoing conflicts. We must prioritize political solutions, support local reconciliation efforts, and end U.S. involvement in wars that lack clear objectives, congressional authorization, or viable exit strategies.

### Key Strategies for Ending Current Wars:

1.  **Prioritize Diplomatic Solutions:**
    *   Intensify diplomatic efforts, working through international and regional partners, to negotiate political settlements to ongoing conflicts where the U.S. is involved directly or indirectly (e.g., Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, lingering engagements related to the "War on Terror").
    *   Support UN-led peace processes and empower diplomatic envoys with the authority and resources needed to broker ceasefires and long-term agreements.

2.  **Responsible Military Withdrawal:**
    *   Develop and implement clear timelines for the responsible withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from long-standing conflict zones, ensuring withdrawals are coordinated with allies and include provisions for protecting vulnerable partners and preventing security vacuums.
    *   Shift focus from large-scale military presence to targeted counterterrorism efforts (where necessary and legally justified) and robust diplomatic and development engagement.

3.  **Repeal Outdated Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs):**
    *   Work with Congress to repeal outdated AUMFs (like the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs) that have been used to justify military actions far beyond their original scope.
    *   Reassert Congress's constitutional role in authorizing the use of military force, requiring specific, time-bound authorizations for any new military engagements. (See also Domestic Agenda section 4.2 Executive Reform).

4.  **Support Peacebuilding and Reconciliation:**
    *   Increase funding for post-conflict stabilization, reconciliation, and peacebuilding programs in regions affected by U.S. military interventions. This includes support for transitional justice, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration (DDR), and rebuilding local governance capacity.
    *   Prioritize humanitarian assistance to address the needs of populations affected by conflict.

5.  **End Support for Proxy Wars and Destabilizing Interventions:**
    *   Cease U.S. military support (arms sales, intelligence, logistical support) for parties involved in proxy wars or interventions that exacerbate regional instability and cause significant civilian harm (e.g., ending support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen).

### Conclusion:

Ending America's involvement in endless wars is a strategic and moral imperative. By prioritizing diplomacy, pursuing responsible military withdrawals, repealing outdated war authorizations, investing in peacebuilding, and ending support for destabilizing proxy conflicts, the U.S. can redirect its resources towards pressing domestic needs and adopt a more sustainable, effective, and principled foreign policy. A focus on peace and diplomacy, rather than perpetual military intervention, will ultimately enhance U.S. security and restore its global leadership.
