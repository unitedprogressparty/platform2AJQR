## Reinvesting in Multilateralism for Collective Action

International institutions—such as the United Nations system, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Health Organization (WHO), international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank), and various treaty bodies—are essential frameworks for addressing global challenges that transcend national borders. From maintaining peace and security to combating climate change, managing pandemics, and regulating the global economy, effective multilateral cooperation is indispensable. However, many of these institutions face challenges related to effectiveness, legitimacy, representation, and resources.

Our platform advocates for renewed U.S. leadership and investment in strengthening and reforming international institutions. We believe that robust multilateralism, while imperfect, is preferable to unilateralism or isolationism for tackling complex global problems and advancing U.S. interests and values.

### Key Strategies for Engaging with International Institutions:

1.  **Recommit to U.S. Leadership and Participation:**
    *   Fully re-engage in key international organizations and treaties from which the U.S. may have withdrawn or disengaged. Pay assessed dues in full and on time.
    *   Actively participate and seek leadership roles within these institutions to shape agendas and promote U.S. priorities and values (democracy, human rights, rule of law).

2.  **Support UN Reform and Effectiveness:**
    *   Advocate for reforms to enhance the effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the United Nations system, including potential reforms of the Security Council to better reflect contemporary geopolitical realities.
    *   Strengthen UN peacekeeping operations through adequate funding, clear mandates, and improved capabilities, while ensuring robust accountability for peacekeepers.
    *   Support the work of specialized UN agencies focused on development, health, human rights, refugees, and climate change.

3.  **Reform International Financial Institutions (IFIs):**
    *   Push for reforms at the World Bank and IMF to increase the voice and representation of developing countries, ensure lending practices support sustainable and equitable development (avoiding harmful austerity conditions), and address global challenges like climate finance and debt relief more effectively. (See also section 4.3).

4.  **Strengthen Global Health Governance:**
    *   Bolster the authority, resources, and independence of the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve global pandemic preparedness, surveillance, and response capabilities.
    *   Support international cooperation on health research, vaccine distribution (e.g., through COVAX), and strengthening health systems globally. (See also Domestic Agenda section 6.2).

5.  **Modernize Trade Governance (WTO):**
    *   Work with partners to reform the World Trade Organization to better address modern trade challenges, including digital trade, state subsidies, environmental protection, and labor rights, while ensuring its dispute settlement mechanism functions effectively and fairly. (See also section 4.2).

6.  **Uphold International Law and Norms:**
    *   Demonstrate U.S. commitment to international law by acceding to key treaties (like UNCLOS, Rome Statute of the ICC where feasible and consistent with U.S. interests) and upholding established legal norms. (See also section 5.7).
    *   Support international courts and tribunals working to ensure accountability for international crimes.

### Conclusion:

Effective international institutions are vital for managing global interdependence and addressing shared challenges. While acknowledging the need for reform, the United States must reinvest in multilateralism, working collaboratively with allies and partners to strengthen global governance frameworks. By leading efforts to make these institutions more effective, representative, and accountable, the U.S. can better advance its interests, promote its values, and contribute to a more peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world order.
