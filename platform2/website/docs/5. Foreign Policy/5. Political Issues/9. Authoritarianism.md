## Defending Democracy Against the Rise of Authoritarian Powers

The global rise of authoritarianism poses a direct challenge to democratic values, human rights, international stability, and U.S. interests. Authoritarian regimes—characterized by concentrated power, suppression of dissent, disregard for the rule of law, state control over information, and often aggressive foreign policies—seek to undermine the rules-based international order and promote alternative models of governance that reject democratic principles.

Our platform commits the United States to leading a concerted international effort to counter the spread of authoritarianism and support democratic resilience worldwide. This requires a comprehensive strategy that leverages diplomatic, economic, and informational tools, strengthens democratic alliances, and holds authoritarian regimes accountable for their actions both domestically and internationally.

### Key Strategies for Countering Authoritarianism:

1.  **Strengthen Democratic Alliances and Partnerships:**
    *   Reinvigorate and expand alliances and partnerships with fellow democracies to present a united front against authoritarian challenges. Coordinate policies on sanctions, technology standards, supply chain security, and responses to authoritarian aggression.
    *   Support regional democratic blocs and initiatives.

2.  **Support Democracy and Human Rights Globally:**
    *   Increase support for pro-democracy movements, independent media, civil society organizations, and human rights defenders within authoritarian states and countries facing democratic backsliding. (See section 5.1).
    *   Utilize public diplomacy and international broadcasting to counter authoritarian narratives and provide access to unbiased information for populations living under repressive regimes. (See section 5.8).

3.  **Hold Authoritarian Regimes Accountable:**
    *   Impose targeted sanctions on officials and entities responsible for significant human rights abuses, corruption, election interference, transnational repression, or undermining democratic institutions.
    *   Work with allies to isolate authoritarian regimes diplomatically when they violate international law or engage in aggressive behavior.
    *   Support international efforts to document and prosecute atrocities committed by authoritarian governments.

4.  **Counter Authoritarian Influence Operations:**
    *   Expose and counter disinformation campaigns, election interference efforts, and other malign influence operations sponsored by authoritarian states aimed at undermining democracies. (See Domestic Agenda section 5.2).
    *   Enhance domestic resilience to foreign interference through media literacy, cybersecurity improvements, and transparency in political funding.

5.  **Address Economic Coercion and Dependencies:**
    *   Work with allies to counter economic coercion by authoritarian states (e.g., weaponization of trade or energy supplies).
    *   Reduce strategic economic dependencies on authoritarian regimes, particularly in critical sectors like technology, energy, and essential minerals, through diversification and friend-shoring. (See sections 4.5, 4.6).

6.  **Promote a Positive Vision of Democracy:**
    *   Articulate and demonstrate the benefits of democratic governance—freedom, prosperity, innovation, human dignity—as a compelling alternative to authoritarian models.
    *   Address democratic weaknesses and inequalities within the U.S. itself to strengthen its credibility as a global advocate for democracy.

### Conclusion:

Countering the global trend of authoritarianism is a central challenge of our time. It requires a sustained, strategic, and collaborative effort led by the United States and its democratic allies. By strengthening alliances, supporting democratic actors worldwide, holding authoritarian regimes accountable, countering malign influence, reducing strategic dependencies, and championing the appeal of democracy itself, we can push back against authoritarianism and help secure a future where freedom and human rights prevail.
