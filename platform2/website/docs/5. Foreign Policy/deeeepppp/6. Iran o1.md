### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The United States and Iran have experienced a tumultuous relationship characterized by mutual distrust, moments of diplomatic overture, and periods of high tension. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) marked a significant diplomatic breakthrough, temporarily easing sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program. However, the U.S. withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, intensifying hostilities. In recent years, limited indirect talks have occurred, though no comprehensive agreement has been reached as of this writing. Meanwhile, domestic issues in Iran, including widespread protests in late 2022 and ongoing human rights concerns, have brought renewed attention to the government’s approach to dissent. Despite these strains, both nations occasionally express cautious optimism about diplomatic engagement, primarily focusing on nuclear non-proliferation and regional stability.

### **Crises**

Use full sentences and 4 paragraphs.

1. Iran is currently grappling with multiple overlapping crises that affect both its domestic stability and broader regional dynamics. One of the most prominent involves the country’s economy, which has suffered from reimposed U.S. sanctions and global economic pressures. High inflation rates and a weakened currency have compounded socio-economic challenges, sparking unrest and protests. This economic strain influences regional trade and, by extension, diplomatic relations with neighbors, including Iraq, Turkey, and Afghanistan.

2. Another critical crisis lies in the security sphere. Iran is engaged in proxy conflicts and alliances across the Middle East, notably supporting allied groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon (e.g., Hezbollah), and Yemen (e.g., the Houthis). These interventions have drawn backlash from regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as international concern over the prospect of escalating hostilities. In addition, Iran’s ballistic missile program and the uncertain status of its nuclear ambitions continue to heighten tensions with the U.S. and European partners.

3. Internally, Iran faces societal and political challenges, evidenced by large-scale protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. These protests were met with forceful government crackdowns, raising alarms about human rights abuses. Ethnic minority regions, including Kurdistan and Sistan-Baluchestan provinces, have seen targeted crackdowns, fueling discontent and demonstrating risks of further domestic unrest. Meanwhile, environmental issues such as water shortages exacerbate economic and social pressures, contributing to ongoing discontent.

4. Regionally, spillover from conflicts in Afghanistan adds to Iran’s refugee burden and security concerns. Iran hosts a significant Afghan refugee population, which can strain resources, and unregulated migration flows create tension along the eastern border. Future crises could emerge from shifting alliances, renewed nuclear tensions, or emboldened insurgent and militant groups, both internally and regionally. As these overlapping crises evolve, managing them requires multilateral engagement and a careful balance of diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian policies.

**Frank Narrative**  
Use full sentences and 4 paragraphs.

1. Iran’s complex and often adversarial relationship with the United States has been shaped by historical interventions, revolutionary ideology, and mutual strategic mistrust. From the 1953 coup to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, this history established deep-seated grievances on both sides. Presently, remnants of these grievances manifest in sanctions, designations of terrorist entities, and heated rhetoric that complicates direct engagement.

2. Domestically, Iran is marked by a rigid power structure led by the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Despite elections for the presidency and parliament, ultimate authority often rests in unelected bodies that restrict the scope of democratic governance. Calls for reform and democratization from Iranian citizens have consistently clashed with the state’s security apparatus, resulting in a tense internal climate and frequent reports of human rights violations.

3. Regionally, Iran operates as both a challenge and a potential partner for U.S. interests. On one hand, its support for militia groups and pursuit of a ballistic missile program undermine U.S. objectives for stability in the Middle East. On the other hand, its strategic position and energy resources make it influential in matters of trade routes and global energy supplies. In certain scenarios, Iran’s cooperation could be beneficial in addressing threats such as ISIS remnants or managing regional political transitions, if mutual trust can be built.

4. Moving forward, a pragmatic approach balancing firm stances on human rights and non-proliferation with limited engagement opportunities may pave the way for incremental improvements. The U.S. seeks to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions and check its regional interventions, while Iran desires sanctions relief and respect for its sovereignty. Reassurance measures, confidence-building, and carefully negotiated agreements could gradually break the cycle of hostility and open avenues for future diplomatic and economic collaboration, though challenges remain significant.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**  
- **Past and present contributions to U.S. strategic interests:**  
  Iran played a brief cooperative role against the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11, providing intelligence that aided U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Despite ongoing tensions, Iran’s potential influence over Shi’a militias in Iraq could either stabilize or destabilize the region, depending on Tehran’s policies.  
- **What we would like in the future:**  
  The U.S. would like Iran to reduce its proxy involvement, assist in counterterrorism measures against extremist groups like ISIS, and maintain open dialogue on maritime security in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, enabling secure trade routes could complement wider U.S. energy security objectives, so cooperation on regional security frameworks would be beneficial.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**  
- **Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges:**  
  Iran seeks relief from crippling economic sanctions, access to international financial systems, and technological assistance to modernize its energy sector. Additionally, Iran has pressing environmental challenges—water scarcity, air pollution, and desertification—where external expertise and investment could be transformative. Collaborative efforts in renewable energy development and infrastructural upgrades could address Iran’s long-term sustainability concerns.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**  
Iran, located in Western Asia and bordering the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea, is a geographically diverse country with mountainous regions, deserts, and coastal areas. It operates under a theocratic republic system, where the Supreme Leader wields ultimate authority, and the President and parliament have limited powers. Iran’s population is estimated at around 85–86 million people. According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran’s GDP stood at approximately USD 231 billion (nominal) in 2021–2022, though exact figures can fluctuate with sanctions and economic pressures. Quality of life indicators vary widely, with educated urban centers showing relatively good literacy rates but rural and marginalized regions lagging in access to services. Freedom House consistently rates Iran as “Not Free,” citing severe restrictions on political freedoms, civil liberties, and media independence.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**  
Iran’s strategic location at the crossroads of the Middle East, its control over key maritime passages like the Strait of Hormuz, and its vast oil and gas reserves confer it significant regional influence. These resources are pivotal to global energy markets; any instability can cause disruptions in the supply chain and affect prices worldwide. From the U.S. perspective, Iran factors into policy decisions regarding counterterrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, and the stability of the broader Middle East. Iran also exerts influence through alliances and proxy networks in neighboring nations, impacting regional diplomacy and security structures.

**Democracy Score:**  
Iran’s formal governance structure includes elected officials, but real power resides with the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, and other unelected bodies that vet candidates and legislation. Elections occur regularly, but the political landscape is constrained by the disqualification of reformist and moderate candidates. The current President is Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in 2021 under conditions criticized by international observers for lacking genuine competition. Hence, while Iran maintains the façade of a republic, its democratic freedoms are heavily curtailed by authoritarian oversight.

**Historical Context:**  
- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S. played a role in the 1953 coup that ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, contributing to long-term mistrust. The 1979 Islamic Revolution led to the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, severing formal diplomatic relations. The Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s further complicated ties. The 2015 JCPOA was a rare instance of diplomatic progress, though its partial collapse in 2018 reignited tensions.  
- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  While official alliances have been minimal since 1979, limited collaboration occurred after 9/11 against the Taliban. The JCPOA remains the most notable modern agreement aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Bilateral relations remain strained primarily due to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, regional interventions, and human rights violations, as well as U.S. sanctions and military presence in the Gulf.

### **2. Strategic Importance**

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**  
  Iran’s largest trade partners include China, the UAE, Turkey, and Russia, especially as Western sanctions have limited broader engagement. China has become a lifeline, buying Iranian oil despite sanctions. Foreign direct investment from Western firms has sharply declined, though some European companies tried to return briefly post-JCPOA before U.S. sanctions re-emerged.  
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**  
  Iran possesses the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves. These resources are crucial to global energy markets and thus to U.S. energy security objectives. Potential diversification or modernization of Iran’s energy sector would require foreign technology and capital, which Iran currently struggles to attract due to sanctions.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**  
  Iran’s support for regional militias and proxy forces is a key concern for the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others. Iran also confronts internal unrest, particularly in areas populated by ethnic minorities like the Kurds, Baluch, and Arabs, some of whom have organized insurgent activities against the central government.  
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**  
  Formal U.S.-Iran military cooperation is virtually nonexistent, with both sides often on opposing ends of regional conflicts. Iran’s alliances with groups in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon have fueled conflicts at odds with U.S. and allied interests. However, limited deconfliction mechanisms occasionally prevent direct confrontation in places like the Strait of Hormuz.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**  
  Iran’s involvement in organizations such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and its observer status in the Eurasian Economic Union reflects its diplomatic maneuvering to mitigate international isolation.  
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**  
  Iran can act as a key stakeholder in any Middle East peace initiatives, including those related to Syria and Yemen. The U.S. can benefit from engaging Iran in multilateral forums (e.g., the United Nations) to facilitate ceasefires or reconstruction efforts, but mistrust remains a stumbling block.

### **3. Current Challenges and Opportunities**

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**  
  Iran’s government suppresses freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Arrests of political activists, journalists, and dissidents underscore the government’s stance on dissent, impacting the bilateral relationship with the U.S. as human rights remain a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in left-leaning circles.  
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**  
  The Supreme Leader’s dominance, alongside bodies like the Revolutionary Guard, ensures a high degree of policy continuity on issues of national security. However, public discontent over economic stagnation and social restrictions periodically flares into protests.  
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**  
  1. The United Nations (both Iran and the U.S. are UN member states).  
  2. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran is a signatory, and the U.S. is also a party.  
  3. Limited engagement under the JCPOA framework (though the U.S. withdrew, indirect negotiations continue to some degree).  
  Beyond these, direct bilateral agreements are minimal, reflecting strained relations.

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**  
  U.S. sanctions inhibit most direct trade with Iran, impacting Iran’s access to foreign markets and finance. Iran’s limited access to the global banking system undercuts any potential for balanced trade.  
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**  
  If Iran meets requirements related to nuclear transparency and reduces regional militant involvement, incremental easing of sanctions could open avenues for U.S. agricultural, medical, and tech exports. Partnerships in renewable energy and infrastructure modernization could also arise under a more favorable diplomatic climate.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**  
  Iran’s backing of the Assad regime in Syria and armed groups in Lebanon and Yemen often clashes with U.S. and allied strategic goals. These alliances create flashpoints where U.S. and Iranian interests collide.  
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**  
  Iran’s cyber capabilities have grown, with reported cyberattacks targeting U.S. infrastructure. Military escalations, such as maritime incidents in the Strait of Hormuz, remain a persistent risk.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**  
  Decades of limited official relations have resulted in minimal direct cultural exchange programs. Nevertheless, there is a sizable Iranian diaspora in the U.S. that fosters personal and cultural links between the two societies.  
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**  
  The U.S. strongly emphasizes individual freedoms and human rights, values that clash with Iran’s governmental restrictions on personal and political freedoms. However, many Iranian citizens share aspirations for greater openness, highlighting a potential area of people-to-people diplomacy.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**  
  Iran is experiencing severe droughts, desertification, and declining water resources. These conditions can exacerbate social tensions and migration pressures.  
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**  
  Should diplomatic relations improve, collaboration on water management, renewable energy (solar, wind), and pollution control could be mutually beneficial.  
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**  
  Water scarcity and resource competition can fuel domestic and cross-border conflicts, further complicating regional stability.

### **4. Policy Goals**

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**  
- **Past and present contributions to U.S. strategic interests:**  
  Iran’s vast energy resources and strategic location have historically influenced global oil markets, which can affect economic stability. The country’s capacity to influence militias in Iraq and Syria could be leveraged to reduce regional violence, if coupled with diplomatic dialogue.  
- **What we would like in the future:**  
  From a U.S. perspective, a more cooperative Iran—especially in stabilizing Iraq and countering ISIS remnants—would support long-term regional stability. The U.S. would also like Iran to engage in productive nuclear discussions, reduce ballistic missile development, and address concerns regarding human rights abuses.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**  
- **Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges:**  
  Iran needs sanctions relief to stabilize its economy, attract foreign investment, and reduce inflation. Technological partnerships in healthcare, infrastructure, and climate mitigation could address domestic deficits. Greater inclusion in global financial institutions could support poverty reduction and improve living standards.

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**  
We propose a phased approach to re-engage Iran, balancing firm conditions with incremental rewards:

1. **Humanitarian & Environmental Exchange:** Allow targeted licenses for the transfer of medical supplies, food, and climate-related technology to address immediate healthcare and environmental needs.  
2. **Confidence-Building Measures:** Support UN-led dialogues on Yemen and Syria, encouraging Iran to facilitate ceasefires and limit arms transfers in exchange for partial sanctions relief in non-military sectors.  
3. **Renewed Nuclear Negotiations:** Pursue a revised agreement that includes stricter oversight of ballistic missile activity and explicit guidelines on human rights conditions, paired with economic incentives.  
4. **Long-Term Engagement:** Establish track-two dialogues on cultural, educational, and scientific exchanges to foster mutual understanding and reduce hostility over time.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

- Strengthening alliances and managing adversarial relationships.  
- Promoting democratic values, human rights, and good governance.  

**Economic Strategies:**

- Expanding mutually beneficial trade and investment opportunities.  
- Encouraging sustainable development and technological cooperation.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**  
Iran’s public health system is relatively well-established but strained by sanctions and limited access to pharmaceuticals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Iran struggled to procure vaccines and medical equipment quickly. The U.S. wants Iran’s cooperation in transparent reporting and regional disease surveillance, which could curb cross-border outbreaks. To gain Iran’s cooperation, the U.S. could offer technical assistance, vaccine support through global health initiatives, and partial lifting of medical-related sanctions, contingent on verifiable improvements in data-sharing and distribution equity.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**  
Iran hosts millions of Afghan refugees, and migration flows across Iran’s borders can impact regional stability. The U.S. seeks improved collaboration on tracking refugee movements, ensuring adequate humanitarian conditions, and preventing radicalization in refugee communities. Iran, in turn, needs international financial support and resources to manage these populations humanely. A cooperative framework with UNHCR involvement, supported by the U.S., could lead to improved refugee protections and streamlined border management.

***Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:***  
Iran’s political system is opaque, with the IRGC wielding significant influence over the economy. The U.S. encourages reforms that promote transparency, reduce corruption, and enhance judicial independence. By offering technical support on anti-corruption mechanisms (e.g., financial tracking, digital governance), and tying sanctions relief to verifiable progress, both sides could establish a more stable investment climate.

***Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:***  
Iran is involved in regional forums, but its strained relationship with Western nations often limits multilateral cooperation. The U.S. could facilitate Iran’s re-engagement with international institutions (e.g., IMF, World Bank) by supporting integration steps once Iran meets specific criteria on nuclear compliance and human rights improvements. This broader engagement could help address shared challenges like terrorism, drug trafficking, and climate change.

***Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:***  
Iran’s restrictive policies on women’s rights, labor rights, and freedom of expression are central to U.S. concerns. Enhancing labor protections, combating gender discrimination, and supporting civil society organizations are priorities for a left-leaning U.S. government seeking social justice. Tying these issues to progressive sanction relief measures—provided Iran demonstrably improves its rights record—may gradually incentivize change.

***Tarrif Report:***  
Due to extensive U.S. sanctions, there is no standard tariff arrangement between the U.S. and Iran akin to normal trading partners. Most trade is heavily restricted, and tariffs are overshadowed by comprehensive sanctions and export controls. Any future tariff adjustments would hinge on significant policy shifts or a new bilateral or multilateral agreement.

***Immigration to USA Report:***  
Iranian nationals seeking to immigrate to the U.S. face stringent vetting processes and travel restrictions. The U.S. has imposed limitations via executive orders in past administrations. Those with family ties or employment-based visas generally undergo extensive security checks. Student visas, while available, are also subject to strict scrutiny.

***Visa Requirements for US Citizen to Visit:***  
U.S. citizens generally must obtain a visa in advance to visit Iran, typically through an Iranian embassy or via licensed travel agencies that coordinate group tours. Independent tourism is heavily restricted, and U.S. citizens often must be accompanied by authorized guides. Political tensions can lead to sudden changes in visa policies.

***Human Rights Details***  
We are strongly interested in spreading human rights to all people in the world. In Iran, significant segments of the population do not enjoy full human rights, especially women, political dissidents, and ethnic/religious minorities like Kurds, Baloch, Bahá’ís, and Christians. Freedom of speech, assembly, and political participation are heavily curtailed. There are reports of arbitrary detentions, unfair trials, and the use of capital punishment for political prisoners. The government also enforces strict Islamic codes on dress and behavior, disproportionately affecting women and youth. To encourage the Iranian government to stop these abuses, the U.S. can leverage targeted sanctions against officials responsible for violations, support international monitoring bodies, and condition diplomatic or economic incentives on measurable improvements in human rights practices. Additionally, bolstering digital freedoms—ensuring access to uncensored internet platforms—can empower civil society groups advocating for reform.

---

By adhering to this comprehensive framework—maintaining a firm stance on human rights while exploring narrow diplomatic and economic openings—the United States can pursue a more stable and constructive relationship with Iran, in line with a left-leaning commitment to social justice, multilateral engagement, and long-term peace in the Middle East.
