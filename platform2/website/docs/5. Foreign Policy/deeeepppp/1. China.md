# **China: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

### **Preface**

The United States and China share one of the world’s most complex and consequential relationships. In recent years, ties have been defined by strategic competition, deep economic interdependence, and periodic diplomatic engagement. High-profile incidents have strained trust – from trade disputes and sanctions to the 2023 downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over U.S. territory ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=President%20Biden%20orders%20the%20U,for%20Taiwan%20and%20trade%20frictions)) – yet both sides recognize the need to manage tensions. Recent talks between President Biden and President Xi Jinping signaled cautious efforts to stabilize relations, including agreements to resume military communications and cooperation on issues like fentanyl trafficking and climate change ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)). The current relationship can thus be described as **tense but actively managed**, with dialogue channels reopening even as strategic rivalry endures.

China’s rapid rise has altered the geopolitical landscape. It is now the world’s second-largest economy and maintains the **second-largest defense budget** (estimated $330–450 billion) ([What the Pentagon’s New Report on Chinese Military Power Reveals About Capabilities, Context, and Consequences \- War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/12/what-the-pentagons-new-report-on-chinese-military-power-reveals-about-capabilities-context-and-consequences/#:~:text=The%20world%E2%80%99s%20second%20largest%20defense,to%20cover%20its%20comprehensive%20missions)), fueling U.S. concerns about Beijing’s military ambitions. Under President Xi, China has grown more assertive in its region, building artificial islands and military outposts in the South China Sea, increasing air and naval patrols near Taiwan, and clashing with India along disputed borders. At the same time, China’s cooperation is indispensable on global challenges from climate change to nuclear nonproliferation. U.S. policy has thus oscillated between confrontation and engagement, seeking to **“compete vigorously” without sliding into conflict ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=presidency,Biden))**.

Recent events underscore both the dangers and opportunities in U.S.-China relations. In August 2022, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan provoked Beijing’s *unprecedented military drills* around the island – including live-fire missile overflights – marking the *Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis* ([Series: The Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis | ChinaPower Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/series-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/#:~:text=When%20then,after%20Pelosi%E2%80%99s%20trip%20to%20Taiwan)). Conversely, in November 2023, a Biden-Xi summit alongside the APEC meeting in San Francisco led to modest goodwill gestures (such as the prospect of new panda loans for U.S. zoos) and reaffirmed commitments to manage disagreements peacefully ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)). These contrasting episodes reflect a relationship at a crossroads: rising friction over sovereignty and security issues, yet a mutual recognition that confrontation must be carefully controlled.

Moving forward, the U.S.-China relationship will likely remain a mix of competition and cooperation. The United States, guided by a **left-leaning, rules-based internationalist perspective**, aims to deter aggressive Chinese actions while engaging Beijing on climate action, public health, and regional stability. China, for its part, seeks respect for its “core interests” (such as Taiwan) and continued access to global markets and technology to sustain its development. This policy proposal document proceeds to analyze China’s strategic profile, challenges, and opportunities in detail – and to recommend a comprehensive U.S. approach that advances American interests **and** acknowledges what Beijing needs for a more stable, cooperative future.

### **Crises:**

China and its surrounding region are navigating multiple, overlapping crises that carry implications for both domestic stability and international security. **Domestically**, China faces economic and social headwinds that have reached critical levels. After decades of breakneck growth, the economy is slowing amid a **property sector debt crisis** and waning investor confidence. The 2021 default of real estate giant Evergrande precipitated an *unprecedented liquidity crunch* in China’s property market ([Chinese property sector crisis (2020–present) \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_property_sector_crisis_\(2020%E2%80%93present\)#:~:text=Chinese%20property%20sector%20crisis%20,2021%20default%20of%20Evergrande%20Group)), forcing dozens of developers into default and eroding consumer wealth tied up in housing. Youth unemployment hit record highs in 2023 (prompting authorities to suspend its reporting), and local governments are grappling with heavy debt. Compounding these economic woes is a looming **demographic crisis**: China’s population has begun to decline after peaking at 1.41 billion, with a rapidly aging society and shrinking workforce. This demographic squeeze, alongside Xi Jinping’s tighter regulatory control over private industries, has dampened growth prospects and could fuel public frustration. Indeed, late 2022 saw rare nationwide protests against harsh zero-COVID controls – a sign that social discontent can erupt despite the regime’s strict authoritarian grip. While Beijing swiftly ended its COVID lockdowns in response, it now confronts the challenge of reinvigorating growth and employment to avert further unrest.

In the **regional context**, security flashpoints around China have escalated in recent years, raising the specter of conflict. Foremost is the situation in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province and has vowed eventual unification; meanwhile, the self-governed island enjoys unofficial U.S. support. Tensions spiked to crisis levels in August 2022 when Pelosi’s Taiwan trip led China to conduct its largest-ever military exercises encircling the island, including **ballistic missile tests over Taiwan** ([Series: The Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis | ChinaPower Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/series-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/#:~:text=When%20then,after%20Pelosi%E2%80%99s%20trip%20to%20Taiwan)). In early 2023, after Taiwan’s president met the U.S. House Speaker during a transit, China again responded with days of warplane sorties and naval maneuvers near Taiwan ([Series: The Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis | ChinaPower Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/series-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/#:~:text=and%20China%20and%20across%20the,Taiwan%20President%20William%20Lai%E2%80%99s%20inauguration)). These events mark the most dangerous Taiwan Strait standoff in decades, with the risk of miscalculation ever-present. In the South China Sea, China’s expansive territorial claims and construction of militarized artificial islands have ignited disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors and led to close encounters with U.S. Navy vessels asserting freedom of navigation. Simultaneously, a **border skirmish with India** in the Himalayas in 2020 turned deadly – the worst Sino-Indian clash in 45 years – showing China’s regional assertiveness extends to multiple fronts. Each of these crises – Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the India border – has the potential to draw in the United States, whether through defense commitments (in Taiwan’s case) or the broader principle of upholding international law.

China has also experienced or contributed to **global crises** that reverberate beyond its borders. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example: the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019\. While Chinese authorities initially imposed draconian lockdowns that delayed the virus’s spread, lack of transparency in the early outbreak (e.g. silencing whistleblower doctors) hindered a swift international response. The pandemic evolved into a worldwide crisis, and U.S.-China frictions deepened as officials traded accusations over the virus’s origin. Only in late 2022 did China abruptly exit its “zero-COVID” policy after public protests, triggering a massive wave of cases. The **health crisis** has thus subsided, but questions remain about China’s willingness to share data in future outbreaks – a critical issue for global health security. Another global challenge is **climate change**, where China’s role is paradoxical: it is the largest greenhouse gas emitter today (nearly one-third of annual CO₂ emissions ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Global%20environmental%20problems%20cannot%20be,economy%20is%20also%20an%20important))) and highly vulnerable to climate impacts (suffering record heatwaves, droughts, and floods) ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=BEIJING%2FSINGAPORE%2C%20July%204%20%28Reuters%29%20,braces%20for%20another%20scorching%20summer)) ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=China%20describes%20itself%20as%20one,faster%20than%20the%20global%20average)). Yet its cooperation is vital for any effective global climate action. The crisis of global warming places pressure on China to curb its coal use and on the U.S. and China to work together on emissions reductions despite strategic tensions. Additionally, the **Russia-Ukraine war** has become a geopolitical crisis testing China’s stance. Beijing declared a nominal neutrality but has provided diplomatic cover and economic support to Moscow, refusing to condemn Russia’s invasion. This has strained China’s relations with the U.S. and Europe, which back Ukraine, and raised concerns that China might similarly challenge the status quo in Asia (as Russia did in Europe). Thus, China is simultaneously managing domestic economic troubles, regional security powder kegs, and a positioning in global crises that could isolate it if mismanaged.

Looking ahead, Beijing and Washington both **anticipate crises that could emerge or worsen** in the near future. Economically, if China cannot engineer a soft landing from its debt-fueled growth model, a financial crisis or prolonged stagnation could set in – destabilizing not only China but the global economy. Politically, Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power (securing a precedent-breaking third term in 2022\) eliminated internal checks and balances; while the regime appears stable, the lack of a succession plan or outlet for dissent poses a latent risk of internal turmoil or factional strife. Regionally, the most perilous potential crisis is a military confrontation over Taiwan. U.S. officials warn that China’s military is striving to attain the capability to invade or blockade Taiwan by the late 2020s (the “2027 timeline”) ([What the Pentagon’s New Report on Chinese Military Power Reveals About Capabilities, Context, and Consequences \- War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/12/what-the-pentagons-new-report-on-chinese-military-power-reveals-about-capabilities-context-and-consequences/#:~:text=In%20its%20dedicated%20section%20on,disrupted%20China%E2%80%99s%202027%20modernization%20goals)), even as the U.S. bolsters Taiwanese defense and its own Indo-Pacific deployments. Miscalculation on either side could trigger a conflict with devastating consequences. Another brewing issue is the **water and environmental crisis** tied to climate: for instance, China’s upstream damming of rivers like the Mekong and Brahmaputra raises tensions with downstream countries over water security, which could intensify under climate stress. Finally, **public health and migration crises** could also arise – for example, if a new pandemic emerges or if China’s internal repression drives larger outflows of refugees and asylum-seekers. Each of these scenarios requires proactive diplomacy and crisis-management mechanisms between the U.S. and China to prevent worst-case outcomes.

**Frank Narrative:**

China stands at a pivotal moment, grappling with internal strains even as it projects strength abroad. **Inside Beijing’s halls of power**, President Xi has tightened the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) control over every aspect of society. The CCP’s narrative emphasizes national rejuvenation – a promise to restore China’s greatness after the “century of humiliation” – but this quest has come at the cost of personal freedoms and openness. Over the past decade, Xi’s government has **decimated civil society** and crushed dissent: hundreds of human rights lawyers and activists have been jailed, Xinjiang’s Uyghur Muslim population has suffered mass detentions and “re-education” (abuses the U.S. labeled a genocide ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=Freedom%20House%20released%20its%20Freedom,and%20Tibet%20are%20listed%20separately))), and Hong Kong’s promised freedoms under “one country, two systems” have been effectively revoked by a sweeping national security law. China’s political system remains a *“Hard Autocracy”* – ranked near the bottom globally in democratic freedoms ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=Freedom%20House%20released%20its%20Freedom,and%20Tibet%20are%20listed%20separately)) ([Ranking](https://www.democracymatrix.com/ranking#:~:text=170%20%20Syria%20%200,017%20%20Hard%20Autocracy)) – with the CCP monopolizing power and tolerating no organized opposition. From a frank U.S. perspective, this authoritarian turn under Xi represents a fundamental challenge: it clashes with American values and has fueled bipartisan concern that a more repressive China will be a more aggressive and destabilizing great power.

At the same time, China’s **geopolitical clout has grown** to unprecedented levels, posing a complex test for U.S. strategy. Economically, China is an engine of global growth and the largest trading partner for countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. U.S. consumers and companies have benefited from access to China’s vast market and manufacturing base, but they have also grown dependent on it – a vulnerability laid bare during the trade war and the pandemic supply chain disruptions. Beijing has leveraged its economic might through initiatives like the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**, financing infrastructure in dozens of nations (often yielding political influence, albeit sometimes at the cost of unsustainable debt for recipients). Technologically, China is no longer just a copier of Western innovations; it is a peer competitor pushing frontiers in 5G telecom (via companies like Huawei), artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space exploration. This has raised alarms in Washington about eroding U.S. tech supremacy and even the security of U.S. networks – leading to export controls designed to **hobble China’s advanced chip industry** ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20U,still%20lacks%20the%20ability%20to)). Militarily, decades of double-digit budget increases have transformed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into a formidable force. China now fields the world’s largest navy by number of ships (370+ warships) and is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal (surpassing 500 warheads and aiming for 1,000+ by 2030\) ([What the Pentagon’s New Report on Chinese Military Power Reveals About Capabilities, Context, and Consequences \- War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/12/what-the-pentagons-new-report-on-chinese-military-power-reveals-about-capabilities-context-and-consequences/#:~:text=Nothing%20looms%20larger%20than%20China%E2%80%99s,reach%20the%20continental%20United%20States)) ([China leading 'rapid expansion' of nuclear arsenal, Pentagon says](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/10/24/china-leading-rapid-expansion-of-nuclear-arsenal-pentagon-says/#:~:text=China%20leading%20%27rapid%20expansion%27%20of,by%202030%2C%20defense%20officials%20said)). These capabilities, coupled with an increasingly nationalistic foreign policy, present a direct challenge to U.S. alliances and interests in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. narrative often frames China as a “revisionist power” intent on supplanting the U.S.-led international order. Indeed, Beijing’s state media and diplomats tout an alternative vision of global governance – one that emphasizes sovereignty and regime security over liberal norms, resonating with some authoritarian and developing states.

Yet, it would be a mistake to view U.S.-China relations in purely zero-sum terms. There remains a **powerful mutual interest in cooperation** on certain transnational issues and a deep economic entanglement that neither side can easily unravel. Climate change is a prime example where U.S. and Chinese interests align: both nations are increasingly battered by extreme weather (China faced *record heat and floods* in 2022–24 ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=BEIJING%2FSINGAPORE%2C%20July%204%20%28Reuters%29%20,braces%20for%20another%20scorching%20summer)) ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=China%20describes%20itself%20as%20one,faster%20than%20the%20global%20average)), while the U.S. has battled historic wildfires and hurricanes), and both are indispensable to cutting global emissions. Indeed, Washington and Beijing worked together to achieve the Paris Climate Accord in 2015 and issued a joint climate pledge in 2014 ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Hong%20Kong%20Protesters%202020%3A%20%E2%80%98Phase)); despite a freeze in talks in 2022 after the Taiwan crisis, climate envoys resumed dialogue in 2023\. Global health is another arena – the painful lessons of COVID-19 show that American and Chinese scientists need to share data and expertise to prevent or contain pandemics. Moreover, China’s influence over nations like North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar means the U.S. often **needs China at the table** to resolve regional conflicts or enforce sanctions. Pragmatically, China’s continued purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds (it remains a top foreign creditor of the U.S. government ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Normalized%20Trade%20Relations%202001%3A%20U.S.,Largest%20Economy))) and the interlocking of supply chains (for example, U.S. tech firms rely on Chinese rare earth minerals, while Chinese factories rely on U.S. semiconductor designs) create a form of mutual dependency. This interdependence acts as a buffer against outright hostility – a “balance of financial terror,” some call it. A frank assessment acknowledges that *neither side can achieve its goals in isolation*: the U.S. cannot tackle global problems or maintain prosperity without some level of Chinese cooperation, and China cannot realize its development and stability aims without a degree of U.S. and international acceptance.

Therefore, the United States faces the task of formulating a **nuanced strategy** toward China – one that defends U.S. interests and values without foreclosing areas of compromise. A frank American narrative to Beijing would be: *We will compete where we must, cooperate where we can, and confront where we ought to*. This means strengthening U.S. alliances and presence in Asia to deter aggressive Chinese moves, while also engaging China in dialogue to build “guardrails” against war ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Looms%202021%3A%20U,Chinese%20Spy%20Balloon%202023%3A%20Biden)). It means enforcing rules on fair trade and human rights – for instance, restricting technology that aids repression – but also negotiating solutions, such as phased tariff reductions or new trade frameworks, that address China’s grievances and U.S. economic concerns. The U.S. wants China to act as a **“responsible stakeholder”** (a term used since 2005 ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Era%201989%3A%20Tiananmen%20Square%20Massacre,Leadership%202013%3A%20Sunnylands%20Summit%202014))), contributing to global public goods rather than undercutting them. From climate initiatives to peacekeeping, there are constructive roles for China that the U.S. should encourage, even as we strongly oppose destabilizing behaviors (like militarizing disputed territories or coercing neighbors). In sum, the narrative is one of conditional cooperation: the door is open for better U.S.-China relations if China respects international norms and reciprocates goodwill. If not, the U.S. is prepared to stand firm with partners to check any threats. Achieving this balance – **pursuing rivalry without reckless escalation, and cooperation without naiveté** – will define American statecraft with China in the coming years.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

* **Maintaining Stability in East Asia:** China can use its influence to reduce regional tensions – for example, pressuring North Korea to curb its nuclear provocations and engaging in confidence-building measures in the South China Sea. In the past, Beijing contributed to six-party talks on North Korea’s denuclearization and cooperated with the U.S. against piracy in the Gulf of Aden. Going forward, the U.S. would like China to act as a stabilizer: refraining from unilateral aggression and potentially mediating flashpoints (such as facilitating dialogue between rival factions in Myanmar or encouraging peace talks in Afghanistan).

* **Counterterrorism and Security:** Although China and the U.S. have different threat perceptions, there is overlap in countering terrorism and extremism. Both have an interest in a stable Afghanistan that is not a terrorist haven. China could support U.S. regional goals by leveraging its ties with Pakistan to promote counterterrorism and by sharing intelligence on extremist groups operating in its west (e.g. any Uyghur extremist networks). The U.S. also values China’s participation in global nonproliferation regimes; for instance, China’s enforcement of sanctions on Iran and North Korea has helped U.S. strategic aims at times. Continued or enhanced Chinese cooperation on these fronts would directly serve U.S. security interests in Asia and beyond.

* **Economic Balance and Global Growth:** China has been instrumental in the global economy as a manufacturing hub and major consumer of commodities. U.S. regional economic goals include sustainable growth and open markets. China can contribute by **addressing trade imbalances** – for instance, by importing more from the U.S. (such as energy, agricultural goods, and services) and enforcing intellectual property protections so U.S. companies compete on a fair footing. The Phase One trade agreement of 2020 saw China increase purchases of U.S. farm goods, indicating its capacity to adjust policies. Additionally, China’s Belt and Road investments, if done transparently and sustainably, could complement U.S. development goals by improving infrastructure in Asia (reducing the burden on U.S. aid). Ideally, China would work within frameworks like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to co-finance projects that meet international standards, thereby helping regional development which aligns with U.S. interests in stability.

* **Climate Change and Health:** U.S. strategic objectives include combating climate change and preparing for pandemics. China’s help is indispensable here. It has invested heavily in renewable energy (leading the world in solar and wind capacity) and in the production of affordable clean technologies (solar panels, EV batteries). By accelerating its emissions peaking (before 2030\) and coal phase-out, China can help the world (and the U.S.) meet climate targets ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Global%20environmental%20problems%20cannot%20be,economy%20is%20also%20an%20important)). Joint U.S.-China initiatives in carbon reduction, green finance, and climate research would amplify global impact. On health, China’s cooperation in early disease detection, transparent data sharing (e.g. virus genome sequences), and jointly developing vaccines or treatments would greatly bolster U.S. and global health security. Past collaboration against epidemics (like avian flu or Ebola in Africa where China deployed medics) shows the potential. The U.S. wants China to be an active partner in strengthening the World Health Organization and global supply chains for critical medical goods – areas where Chinese contributions directly advance U.S. goals of a safer, healthier world.

*What we would like in the future:* The U.S. seeks an evolution of China’s role from a sometimes spoiler to a consistent collaborator on key issues. This means China helping uphold **regional peace** (by respecting international law, for example abiding by the arbitral ruling on the South China Sea and easing military pressure on Taiwan), contributing to **humanitarian efforts** (such as debt relief for poorer nations or refugee assistance), and actively engaging in **arms control** discussions as a major military power (e.g. joining talks to limit intermediate-range missiles or nuclear warheads). If China uses its growing power to bolster the existing international system – joining peacekeeping missions, mediating conflicts like between Saudi Arabia and Iran as it did recently, and expanding people-to-people exchanges – it would significantly aid U.S. objectives of a stable, prosperous Indo-Pacific. In essence, **a China that is a responsible stakeholder and problem-solver** on the world stage would be a boon to U.S. regional goals.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

* **Economic and Technological Opportunities:** China still needs access to global markets, capital, and technology to sustain its development. Despite its huge economy, China’s GDP per capita (\~$12,600 in 2023\) is only a fraction of advanced economies ([China \- World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/country/china#:~:text=China%20,%282023)), and it aspires to avoid the “middle income trap.” U.S. and Western investment, expertise, and consumers have been crucial to China’s rise. Beijing wants the U.S. to remove punitive tariffs – which remain at an average **19% on Chinese goods (up from 3% pre-2018) ([US-China Trade War Tariffs: An Up-to-Date Chart | PIIE](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart#:~:text=US,trade%20war%20began%20in%202018))** – and to lift export controls on high-tech components. These measures weigh on China’s export sector and hinder its tech industry’s progress. China needs a stable trade relationship and would benefit from new frameworks (like a revived bilateral investment treaty or cooperation in sectors such as semiconductors and AI under agreed rules) to spur growth. In short, China needs the U.S. to not “decouple” but rather find a modus vivendi that allows *responsible commerce* and innovation partnerships (for example, joint research on climate tech or public health) while respecting U.S. security concerns.

* **Domestic Development Support:** Internally, China faces challenges – from rural poverty in some western regions to environmental degradation – where U.S. support could be impactful. While China has eradicated extreme poverty, about **17% of Chinese live on under $6.85/day (upper-middle income poverty line) ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=China%20is%20now%20an%20upper,poverty%20line%2C%20in%202021))**, meaning economic inequality persists. U.S. and international cooperation in development initiatives (such as consulting on best practices for rural development, agriculture technology, or healthcare delivery) can help China address these gaps. Additionally, China’s need to transition to a more sustainable growth model (services and consumption-driven rather than export-investment-heavy) could be aided by U.S. businesses and expertise in finance, services, and innovation. Beijing also seeks continued U.S. involvement in multilateral institutions like the World Bank and IMF to ensure these organizations fund projects in China (albeit China’s borrowing has decreased as it grew wealthier, expertise sharing is still valued).

* **Energy and Resource Security:** With the world’s largest population and manufacturing base, China has enormous energy needs and resource requirements. It relies on imports for oil and gas, much of which transit sea lanes protected historically by the U.S. Navy. For China to feel secure, it needs stable energy markets and freedom from the fear of blockade. The U.S. can contribute by maintaining open sea lanes (which aligns with U.S. principles of freedom of navigation) and by working with China on **energy diversification** – such as assisting its nuclear energy safety or collaborating on strategic petroleum reserves. China is also resource-hungry for minerals (like iron, copper, and critical rare earths, though it dominates rare earth production itself). The global community’s role – ensuring fair access and preventing resource hoarding – is something China desires. In essence, China needs the international system (and the U.S. as its leader) to continue providing a stable framework for trade and resource flows that fueled China’s ascent.

* **International Legitimacy and Respect:** As much as material needs, China’s leadership craves recognition as a great power. It wants the U.S. and others to respect its sovereignty and political system – meaning non-interference in what Beijing calls “internal affairs” (Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong). From China’s view, U.S. advocacy on human rights or support for Taiwan’s defense are perceived as threats to its core interests. While the U.S. is unlikely to cease these actions, understanding China’s perspective is key. What China likely **needs** is some assurance that the U.S. is not seeking regime change or containment for containment’s sake. This could take the form of renewed high-level dialogues, **reaffirmation of the One-China policy** (with the U.S. maintaining it does not support Taiwan independence), and calibrated U.S. rhetoric that distinguishes between legitimate criticism and outright hostility. Internationally, China benefits from cooperation in global governance – it needs a voice in setting rules. Engaging China and giving it stake (for example, greater voting power in the IMF, or inclusion in mega trade deals if it meets standards) is something Beijing wants to satisfy its prestige. In summary, China needs the U.S. and world to *acknowledge its status and interests* – even as it, in turn, must reassure the world by respecting international norms.

With these needs in mind, a durable U.S.-China policy must seek **reciprocity** – finding overlap between what the U.S. expects and what China requires. The next sections delve into specifics of China’s profile and recommend policy actions to achieve a balanced, constructive relationship.

### **1\. Overview**

#### **Country Profile:**

China is a vast nation in East Asia, geographically spanning 9.6 million square kilometers – nearly as large as the United States – with diverse landscapes from the Himalayas and deserts in the west to fertile plains and a long Pacific coastline in the east. It is the world’s most populous country, home to approximately **1.41 billion people** (2023) ([Population, total \- China \- World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=CN#:~:text=Population%2C%20total%20,2023)), though notably its population has begun to decline after decades of low birth rates. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) was established in 1949 and is governed as a **single-party socialist republic** under the Chinese Communist Party. Its political system is highly centralized; President Xi Jinping simultaneously holds the top party, state, and military positions. Economically, China has experienced an extraordinary transformation: since initiating market-oriented reforms in 1978, it has averaged about 9% annual GDP growth, lifting over **800 million people out of poverty** ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=The%20World%20Bank%20In%20China)) ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Since%20China%20began%20to%20open,services%20over%20the%20same%20period)). Today, China’s GDP stands around **$18 trillion** (2023), making it the second-largest economy globally ([RPT BREAKINGVIEWS Xi Jinping’s graft crackdown is fight without end | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/xi-jinpings-graft-crackdown-is-fight-without-end-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20it,18%20trillion%20economy%20more%20efficient)). GDP per capita is roughly $12,000–13,000 ([China \- World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/country/china#:~:text=China%20,%282023)), reflecting its status as an upper-middle-income country. Major industries include manufacturing (China is often dubbed the “world’s factory”), technology, agriculture, and increasingly services. Despite vast wealth creation, there are disparities – coastal megacities like Shanghai and Shenzhen enjoy living standards comparable to Europe, while inland rural provinces lag behind. Quality of life indicators have improved markedly in recent decades: life expectancy has risen to about **78 years** ([China \- WHO Data](https://data.who.int/countries/156#:~:text=In%20China%2C%20life%20expectancy%20at,years%20in%202021)), literacy is near-universal, and China’s infrastructure (high-speed rail, highways, telecommunications) is world-class. However, citizens lack political freedoms, and issues such as air pollution, water scarcity, and corruption affect day-to-day life. Various indices rank China poorly on freedom – Freedom House scores China just **9 out of 100 (“Not Free”) ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=Freedom%20House%20released%20its%20Freedom,and%20Tibet%20are%20listed%20separately))**, highlighting the trade-off between material advancement and civil liberties.

#### **Importance to National/Global Interests:**

China’s importance to both U.S. national interests and broader global interests cannot be overstated. **Geostrategically**, China’s location at the heart of Asia, bordering 14 countries and sitting astride vital trade routes, means its stance greatly impacts regional stability. It controls the South China Sea (a conduit for one-third of global shipping) and is adjacent to flashpoints involving U.S. allies and partners (India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan). Any conflict involving China – whether on the Korean Peninsula or across the Taiwan Strait – could quickly embroil the United States due to treaty obligations and the imperative of maintaining a free Indo-Pacific. Conversely, a cooperative China can bolster stability, as seen by its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, where it has a veto over decisions affecting global peace and security.

In terms of **resources and economic impact**, China plays a central role in global supply chains and resource markets. It is the world’s largest importer of oil and a leading buyer of soybeans, minerals, and many commodities, so its demand influences global prices and energy security. For the U.S., China is a critical trading partner – at times the largest or second-largest for goods. U.S.-China bilateral trade was about $559 billion in 2022 (despite tariffs), with China exporting vast quantities of consumer goods to the U.S., and the U.S. exporting substantial amounts of farm products, semiconductors, and vehicles to China ([\[PDF\] U.S. Trade with China 2022 \- Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file#:~:text=,of%20%28%2429.4%20billion%29)). China’s holdings of over $800 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds provide financing for the U.S. deficit, intertwining the financial fates of the two powers ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Normalized%20Trade%20Relations%202001%3A%20U.S.,Largest%20Economy)). Strategically important resources like **rare earth elements** (essential for electronics and defense systems) are heavily sourced from China, which at one point produced over 80% of the global supply – a leverage point the U.S. is keenly aware of. Additionally, China’s industrial capacity means it will shape the future of technologies from 5G networks to electric vehicles. For example, Chinese firms make a significant share of the world’s solar panels and lithium batteries, products crucial to clean energy goals. Thus, whether for **energy security**, **climate change mitigation**, or **technological innovation**, China’s choices and cooperation are pivotal to global outcomes.

From the national security angle, China has become a primary focus of U.S. strategic planning, reflected in its designation as a “pacing challenge” by the Pentagon. The country’s expanding military reach – with a navy operating in the Indian Ocean and beyond, and a growing nuclear arsenal – impacts global security frameworks. China’s **role in counterterrorism** has been limited but not irrelevant; it has a vested interest in quelling militant Islamism (given concerns about Uyghur extremists) and has contributed troops to UN peacekeeping missions in conflict zones (it’s actually the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the P5 members). This shows potential alignment with global security efforts if harnessed. On the diplomatic front, China’s clout in organizations like the World Health Organization and World Trade Organization means it can either facilitate solutions or pose obstacles. For instance, its cooperation was vital in the 2014 Ebola response in Africa and in reaching the Iran nuclear deal (China was part of the P5+1 negotiations). Overall, China’s **sheer size and influence make it a linchpin**: its active partnership or its obstruction can tilt the balance in international endeavors ranging from pandemic response to climate treaties.

In summary, China’s location, resources, and stance render it *uniquely influential*. The U.S. recognizes that many of its own national interests – be it maintaining a stable international economy, preventing nuclear proliferation, or ensuring allies’ security – are directly affected by what China does. Therefore, integrating China into cooperative mechanisms (when possible) while guarding against destabilizing behavior (when necessary) is essential for both U.S. and global interests.

#### **Democracy Score:**

China’s political system is **authoritarian**, characterized by one-party rule under the CCP with Xi Jinping at its core. Officially, the PRC calls itself a “socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics,” but in practice, there are no free elections for national leadership, and dissent is tightly controlled. Any assessment of democracy in China yields very low scores: Freedom House rates China 9/100 ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=Freedom%20House%20released%20its%20Freedom,and%20Tibet%20are%20listed%20separately)) (Not Free), and the Economist Intelligence Unit consistently categorizes it as an “authoritarian regime” near the bottom of its global index. This disconnect between official structures and reality is stark. The PRC’s constitution provides for a legislature (the National People’s Congress) and a State Council (government cabinet), but **real power lies within the CCP’s Politburo and its Standing Committee**, none of whom are chosen through open popular vote. Xi Jinping’s tenure has further blurred state-party lines; he has accumulated titles – General Secretary of the CCP, President of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission – making him the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. In 2018, term limits on the presidency were abolished, allowing Xi to rule indefinitely. The CCP’s grip extends to the judiciary (nominally independent, but in practice subservient), the media (heavily censored, with virtually all outlets state-controlled or monitored), and the economy (state-owned enterprises dominate key sectors, and even private firms are subject to party cells and directives).

In comparing official structures to real-world dynamics: on paper China has elections at local levels and a system of People’s Congresses cascading up from provinces to the National People’s Congress (NPC). However, all candidates are pre-vetted by the CCP, and the NPC functions largely as a rubber stamp. For example, when Xi sought “re-election” for a third term in 2023, the NPC dutifully confirmed him with near-unanimous votes. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference exists as an advisory body with various societal representatives, but it has no decision-making power. Meanwhile, *actual decision-making occurs behind closed doors* in party meetings and Xi’s inner circle. The lack of transparency often means policies emerge suddenly – such as crackdowns on tech billionaires or COVID lockdown edicts – reflecting top-down rule rather than institutional checks and balances. The ruling party today is the CCP, which has been in power since 1949; there are eight minor registered “democratic parties,” but they have no independent power and exist only to present an image of pluralism.

Currently, **the Communist Party is firmly in charge**, led by Xi Jinping and aligned under his ideological campaign of the “Chinese Dream” and “Common Prosperity.” The “Democracy Score” of China can thus be summarized as extremely low: governance is authoritarian, and rule of law is subordinate to party rule. Citizens do not have the right to change their government through free elections. Civil liberties – freedom of speech, assembly, religion – are heavily curtailed. Notably, the CCP justifies its system by claiming it delivers economic growth and stability, contrasting it with what it views as chaotic Western democracies. From a U.S. foreign policy perspective, these undemocratic characteristics are a source of friction – manifest in criticism of China’s human rights record – and a fundamental difference in values that complicates the relationship.

#### **Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:** The history of U.S.-China relations has swung between alliance, estrangement, and engagement. Significant milestones include:

* **1949:** The Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. Mao Zedong established the PRC in October 1949 ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Crowds%20display%20posters%20of%20Chinese,AP%20Photo)), while the U.S.-backed Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. The U.S. refused to recognize the PRC for the next 30 years, instead maintaining relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) – setting the stage for decades of Cold War estrangement.

* **1950-53:** The Korean War. China’s entry into the war on the side of North Korea brought Chinese and U.S. forces into direct conflict. This cemented hostility; the U.S. 7th Fleet began patrolling the Taiwan Strait to prevent PRC invasion of Taiwan, and America imposed an embargo on China.

* **1971-72:** Rapprochement via “Ping-Pong Diplomacy” and President Nixon’s visit. In a dramatic shift, President Richard Nixon traveled to Beijing in 1972 to meet Mao – an epochal event preceded by secret diplomacy from Henry Kissinger. The **1972 Shanghai Communiqué** set basic terms: the U.S. acknowledged the One-China principle (that Chinese on both sides of the strait maintain China is one, implying Taiwan is part of China), and both sides agreed to normalize relations and oppose hegemony in Asia ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Test%201969%3A%20Sino,Leadership%202013%3A%20Sunnylands%20Summit%202014)). This opened liaison offices and initiated cooperation against the Soviet Union.

* **1979:** Formal normalization of U.S.-PRC relations. The U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on January 1, 1979 ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Test%201969%3A%20Sino,Leadership%202013%3A%20Sunnylands%20Summit%202014)). The two countries established embassies, and another communiqué affirmed the One-China Policy. Later that year, the Taiwan Relations Act (U.S. law) was passed to maintain unofficial ties and defensive support to Taiwan – an enduring point of contention.

* **1989:** Tiananmen Square crackdown. On June 4, 1989, China’s military crushed peaceful pro-democracy protests in Beijing, killing hundreds. The U.S. and other Western nations responded with sanctions and a freeze in relations. President George H.W. Bush suspended military sales and high-level exchanges. This was a low point, but Bush also quietly maintained backchannel contacts.

* **2001:** China’s WTO entry and the EP-3 incident. After years of negotiation, China joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001, marking its full integration into the global trading system (the U.S. had granted Permanent Normal Trade Relations earlier that year). Just months prior in April 2001, a U.S. Navy EP-3 surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter near Hainan Island, forcing an emergency landing – a tense standoff ensued until China released the U.S. crew ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Era%201989%3A%20Tiananmen%20Square%20Massacre,Military%20Spending%202008%3A%20China%20Becomes)). These events exemplify the mix of cooperation and friction.

* **2008:** The Beijing Olympics and China as largest U.S. creditor. China’s successful hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics symbolized its emergence on the world stage. Around the same time, China became the top foreign holder of U.S. debt ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Normalized%20Trade%20Relations%202001%3A%20U.S.,Largest%20Economy)), reflecting deepening economic interdependence. The 2000s saw overall warming ties, with robust trade and cooperation on issues like North Korea’s nuclear program (through the Six-Party Talks).

* **2012-2015:** Pivot to Asia and growing tensions. Under President Obama, the U.S. “pivot/rebalance” to Asia signaled renewed focus on countering China’s assertiveness. By 2015, disputes flared as China built artificial islands in the South China Sea and the U.S. responded with “freedom of navigation” operations ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Hong%20Kong%20Protesters%202020%3A%20%E2%80%98Phase)). In 2014, Obama and Xi did collaborate on a landmark *U.S.-China Joint Climate Agreement* ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Hong%20Kong%20Protesters%202020%3A%20%E2%80%98Phase)), showing dual-track engagement despite strategic wariness.

* **2018-2020:** Trade war and deteriorating relations. The Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, protesting unfair trade and IP theft ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Warns%20China%20Over%20South%20China,Diplomatic%20Escalation%202020%3A%20Pompeo%20Says)). China retaliated with its tariffs. By 2019, the U.S. labeled China a currency manipulator and sanctioned tech giant Huawei. A Phase One deal in January 2020 paused escalation ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=States%202019%3A%20Trade%20War%20Intensifies,Hong%20Kong%E2%80%99s%20Special%20Status%202020)), but soon tensions soared over the COVID-19 pandemic (with accusations over virus origin and China’s expulsion of U.S. journalists ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=States%202019%3A%20Trade%20War%20Intensifies,Ramps%20Up%20Pressure%20as%20Transition))) and Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong (leading Trump to revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=States%202019%3A%20Trade%20War%20Intensifies,Diplomatic%20Escalation%202020%3A%20Pompeo%20Says))).

* **2021-2023:** Toward “competitive coexistence.” The Biden administration initially kept tariffs and took a tough rhetorical line on human rights (declaring Uyghur abuses a genocide ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Looms%202021%3A%20U,S)), rallying allies to speak on Xinjiang and Hong Kong). But it also sought “guardrails” to avoid conflict, leading to high-level talks. In 2022, House Speaker Pelosi’s Taiwan visit triggered a crisis ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Imposes%20Diplomatic%20Boycott%20on%20Beijing,Chinese%20Spy%20Balloon%202023%3A%20Biden)). In 2023, after the spy balloon incident disrupted diplomacy, Biden and Xi finally met in November, agreeing to reopen military and drug cooperation channels ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)). The trajectory is toward managing competition without letting it spiral into open confrontation.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

* **Major Treaties/Communiqués:** The three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués (1972, 1979, 1982\) form the diplomatic foundation. The 1982 Communiqué addressed arms sales to Taiwan, with the U.S. stating an intent to gradually decrease them (contingent on peaceful cross-strait prospects) – an area of recurring friction as U.S. arms sales continue. There is no formal alliance or defense treaty between the U.S. and China; rather, **agreements have focused on cooperation and dialogue**. Examples include the 2015 U.S.-China Cybersecurity agreement where both sides pledged not to conduct cyber theft of intellectual property for commercial gain (after a U.S. indictment of PLA hackers ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Labels%20China%20a%20Currency))), and bilateral consular conventions and science & technology cooperation agreements dating back to the 1979 normalization era.

* **Conflicts:** Aside from the Korean War, U.S. and Chinese forces have not fought directly since 1953, but they nearly did during crises like the 1954–55 and 1958 Taiwan Strait Crises (when China shelled Taiwan-held islands and the U.S. contemplated intervention). In Vietnam, China and the U.S. were adversaries by proxy (China armed North Vietnam against the U.S.). The most enduring quasi-conflict is over Taiwan: the U.S. policy of deterrence (via the Taiwan Relations Act) vs. China’s insistence on eventual unification. Also notable is the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (during the Kosovo war), which killed Chinese citizens and sparked outrage; the U.S. said it was an accident, but it strained relations ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Era%201989%3A%20Tiananmen%20Square%20Massacre,Spy%20Plane%20Standoff%202005%3A%20%E2%80%98Responsible)).

* **Partnerships:** There have been surprisingly fruitful partnerships in certain periods. In the 1980s, the U.S. and China had a tacit strategic alignment against the Soviet Union – the U.S. even sold some military equipment to China in the early ’80s and cooperated on intelligence against Soviet forces. In the War on Terror post-2001, China gave diplomatic support to U.S. efforts and shared some intel on Islamic militants (though it also tried to label Uyghur separatists as part of global terror networks to justify its crackdowns). In global governance, the U.S. and China worked together in response to the 2008 global financial crisis at the G20, and in 2016 both jointly ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, demonstrating leadership on climate. Educational and cultural exchanges boomed since the 1980s – with hundreds of thousands of Chinese students studying in the U.S. (nearly 370,000 at the peak in 2019), and many American schools and cities linking with Chinese counterparts, fostering people-to-people ties.

Overall, bilateral relations have gone through **cycles of cooperation and strain**. Currently, they are strained, but the historical context shows capacity for recalibration. Partnerships on trade and climate, for instance, coexist with conflicts over human rights and regional security. This duality must be navigated in any forward-looking policy.

### **2\. Strategic Importance**

#### **Economic Interests:**

**Trade Relationships:** China is an economic behemoth whose trade relationships shape global commerce. It is the number-one merchandise trading partner for over 120 countries, including key U.S. allies. For the United States specifically, China was for many years the largest source of U.S. imports – from electronics and machinery to furniture and toys – and a significant export market for American farmers and manufacturers. In 2022, U.S. imports from China were about $537 billion while exports to China were around $154 billion ([\[PDF\] U.S. Trade with China 2022 \- Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file#:~:text=,of%20%28%2429.4%20billion%29)), yielding a massive trade deficit of roughly **$383 billion** ([\[PDF\] U.S. Trade with China 2022 \- Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file#:~:text=,of%20%28%2429.4%20billion%29)). Although this deficit has slightly decreased from its peak (due in part to tariffs and diversification), it remains the largest bilateral trade imbalance in the world. China’s major exports to the U.S. include consumer electronics (phones, computers), apparel, and machinery, benefiting U.S. consumers with lower prices but also contributing to manufacturing job losses in the U.S. in past decades. U.S. exports to China are led by agricultural products (soybeans, corn, pork), aerospace (commercial aircraft), automobiles, and semiconductors. China is vital for U.S. soybean farmers (China is the top buyer globally). However, U.S. firms often face **market access issues** in China – from forced technology transfer requirements to unequal treatment favoring Chinese state-owned enterprises.

In recent years, mutual investments have also been notable. U.S. companies have poured investment into China (over $100 billion in cumulative FDI), building factories and tapping the huge consumer market (e.g., General Motors sells more cars in China than in the U.S.). Chinese investment in the U.S. grew in the 2010s (in real estate, tech startups, etc.), but has been curtailed by stricter U.S. scrutiny (CFIUS reviews blocking deals over security concerns). Additionally, China holds significant financial stakes in the U.S. via Treasury securities, though its holdings have modestly declined as it diversifies reserves. Trade tensions since 2018 saw tit-for-tat **tariffs**: U.S. average tariffs on Chinese goods jumped to \~19% ([US-China Trade War Tariffs: An Up-to-Date Chart | PIIE](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart#:~:text=US,trade%20war%20began%20in%202018)), and China levied tariffs on about $110 billion of U.S. goods, including 25% duties on soybeans and autos, which hurt U.S. farmers (who received bailout payments to compensate (['Here's your check': Trump's massive payouts to farmers will be hard ...](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/14/donald-trump-coronavirus-farmer-bailouts-359932#:~:text=,Instead%2C%20the%20money)) ([Trump Tariff Aid To Farmers Cost More Than U.S. Nuclear Forces](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/01/21/trump-tariff-aid-to-farmers-cost-more-than-us-nuclear-forces/#:~:text=Trump%20Tariff%20Aid%20To%20Farmers,trade%20practices%2C%E2%80%9D%20stated%20a))). A partial truce (Phase One deal) in 2020 had China committing to purchase an extra $200 billion of U.S. goods over two years; it fell short of targets but did boost some exports like energy. Overall, the trade relationship is huge but fraught: **the U.S. seeks fairer terms (reducing the deficit, stopping IP theft)** while China seeks continued access to the lucrative U.S. market and stable trade flows.

Beyond the U.S., China’s other major trade partners include the European Union (China-EU trade is similar in scale to U.S.-China trade), Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia (ASEAN is now China’s largest trading bloc partner). China is also a central node in global supply chains – for example, it assembles the majority of the world’s smartphones and PCs, often using components from neighbors like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. This interdependence means any disruption (like U.S. tariffs or a pandemic lockdown) has ripple effects across many economies. Additionally, China is actively setting up trade agreements: it led the formation of the **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)**, a huge Asia-Pacific trade pact (15 countries, though notably not the U.S.), and it has expressed interest in joining the CPTPP (the trans-Pacific trade pact the U.S. withdrew from). These moves could embed China more deeply in regional trade networks, potentially at the expense of U.S. influence if the U.S. is absent. In short, China’s trade relationships are critical to global economic health, and managing trade with China – whether through agreements or defensive measures – is a strategic economic priority for the U.S.

**Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:** China’s sheer scale makes it both a consumer and producer of strategic resources. **Energy** is paramount: China is the world’s largest energy consumer and top oil importer. It heavily relies on the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq) and Africa (Angola) for oil, and on Australia and Indonesia for coal (though it’s also the largest coal producer). To secure these supplies, China has forged partnerships – such as long-term oil deals with Gulf states and investments in oil fields (in Iraq, Sudan, etc.), often accompanied by infrastructure building via the BRI. For natural gas, China imports LNG from Australia and Qatar and pipelines from Central Asia and Russia (the Power of Siberia pipeline). U.S. energy exports (LNG, crude oil) to China grew after 2016, presenting a new area of trade synergy until tariffs hit LNG in the trade war. Ensuring stable energy markets aligns U.S. and Chinese interests, as both suffer from spikes in oil prices.

Minerals and metals are another strategic area. China has significant deposits of rare earth elements and has cultivated a near-monopoly in their processing. These 17 elements are crucial for high-tech manufacturing (from smartphones to missile guidance). The U.S. is dependent on imports for rare earths, and in 2010 China even embargoed their export to Japan during a territorial spat, showing how it can leverage this dominance. The U.S. is now trying to develop alternate sources (like Mountain Pass mine in California and partnerships with Australia) to reduce reliance on China. China also is a major player in critical minerals like lithium and cobalt (needed for batteries), often through investments in mining in Africa and Latin America (e.g., cobalt in the DRC, lithium in Chile). This has led to some quiet collaboration and competition: while the U.S. seeks to secure supply chains for these materials (working with allies), it recognizes that China’s cooperation in avoiding supply shocks is important.

**Economic partnerships** are a key tool of China’s statecraft. The Belt and Road Initiative, launched in 2013, is a global infrastructure and connectivity drive. It involves China financing and building roads, ports, railways, and power plants across Eurasia, Africa, and beyond. For instance, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship BRI project with tens of billions in investment. These partnerships give China economic footholds and political goodwill (or leverage) across the developing world. While not directly involving the U.S., they affect U.S. interests; some projects pass through strategic chokepoints (like ports in the Indian Ocean) and can incur unsustainable debts (Sri Lanka famously had to lease Hambantota port to China due to debt – raising strategic concerns). The U.S. has responded with initiatives like the Blue Dot Network and G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure to offer alternative financing, but China’s spending often dwarfs others.

To U.S. economic and energy security, some Chinese partnerships are critical. For example, China’s dealings with Iran (buying oil despite U.S. sanctions) can weaken U.S. leverage over Iran’s nuclear program. Conversely, China’s cooperation with U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia (it recently brokered a détente between Saudi and Iran) can indirectly support stability that benefits global oil supply and U.S. interests. In technology, China’s partnerships and investments in other countries’ telecom networks (like Huawei’s 5G deals) have rung alarm bells in Washington, leading to U.S. campaigns urging allies to ban Chinese 5G gear for security reasons. So strategic resources (energy, minerals, tech) and partnerships (BRI deals, trade pacts) involving China have huge implications: they can either complement global needs or concentrate influence in ways that challenge the U.S. The U.S. aims to ensure that critical resources remain accessible and not weaponized, and that China’s economic outreach adheres to transparency and sustainability, to mitigate any threat to U.S. economic security.

#### **Security & Defense:**

**Shared Security Concerns or Threats:** Despite the rivalry, the U.S. and China do share some security concerns where interests overlap. One is the threat of **terrorism and extremism**. Both countries have been victims of terrorism (the U.S. on 9/11; China has had sporadic attacks, such as knife and bomb attacks attributed to Uyghur separatists in the 2000s and 2010s). China publicly supports global efforts against groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. In Afghanistan, post-U.S. withdrawal, both Washington and Beijing fear the country could become a terrorist haven; they would like the Taliban to prevent groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) or ISIS-K from operating. Counter-narcotics is another area emerging as a shared security concern: the U.S. is suffering a fentanyl overdose epidemic, and China has been a source of precursor chemicals for fentanyl. Both agreed in late 2023 to work on stemming illicit drug flows ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)), reflecting a mutual interest in combating drug trafficking networks.

Regional insurgencies and instability worry both to some extent. For example, the nuclear-armed **North Korea** is a shared concern – though their approaches differ, neither the U.S. nor China wants war or nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. China fears a collapse of North Korea (which could send refugees into China and eliminate a buffer state), and the U.S. fears North Korean ICBMs threatening the homeland. This has led to both cooperation (China voted for UN sanctions on North Korea multiple times) and friction (China often relaxes enforcement to keep Pyongyang afloat). Similarly, in Pakistan and Central Asia, Islamic militancy or state collapse would threaten Chinese investments (like CPEC) and regional stability, which aligns with U.S. counterterror goals.

Current conflicts where both want de-escalation include the war in Ukraine – while the U.S. firmly opposes Russia’s invasion and China officially calls for ceasefire (yet tilts towards Russia), both Washington and Beijing do publicly oppose the use of nuclear weapons in that conflict ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=presidency,Biden)), a notable common stance. Both also have an interest in **cybersecurity** to a degree: each is vulnerable to cyberattacks on infrastructure (though China is seen as a top perpetrator of state-sponsored cyber espionage). An uncontrolled cyber conflict or cyber-criminal networks is a threat both acknowledge, hence some dialogue on norms of cyber behavior has occurred.

However, many security issues are not shared but rather opposed – for instance, China sees separatism in Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang as top threats (whereas the U.S. sees human rights issues there). But at a broad level, **avoiding nuclear war and preventing global chaos** are overarching concerns both powers implicitly share. This is why strategic stability talks (on nuclear arsenals, space security) are important even if China has been reluctant to enter formal arms control. Emerging threats like **climate change** also blur into security: climate-induced disasters can trigger instability and humanitarian crises, which both militaries may have to respond to (PLA and U.S. military cooperation in disaster relief – like during the 2014 MH370 search or Ebola response – shows that shared human security interests exist). In summary, while the list of common enemies is short, **the shared interest in stability is real** – neither wants rogue states using WMDs, global terror networks flourishing, or uncontrolled arms races in space or cyber that could backfire on them.

**Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:** The U.S. and China do not have a military alliance; instead, they increasingly view each other as potential adversaries. However, there have been limited **military-to-military cooperations** in the past. For instance, in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia, the Chinese Navy has coordinated with the U.S.-led task force to protect shipping since 2008\. Both navies communicated and even carried out joint escorts on occasion, demonstrating practical cooperation. Chinese and U.S. armed forces also worked together in international peacekeeping drills and humanitarian exercises sporadically. In 2016 and 2014, the PLA Navy participated in the U.S.-hosted RIMPAC naval exercise in Hawaii, indicating a willingness to engage (this has since halted as relations soured). There have been agreements on **military dialogue**: the two countries established a Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA) to discuss maritime safety, and a hotline between defense departments (though China often freezes military ties during political disputes). After a pause, they agreed in 2023 to restart high-level military talks ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)) to reduce risks.

In terms of alliances, China’s only formal alliance is with North Korea (1961 treaty), but that bond is strained. Instead of alliances, China has a “strategic partnership” network (with Russia, Pakistan, etc.). The U.S., conversely, has treaty allies ringing China (Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia via ANZUS, Thailand) and partners like Taiwan, India, and others – which China sees as the U.S. “encircling” it. This dynamic creates an **indirect security relationship**: e.g., the U.S. alliance with Japan means if China-Japan tensions (say over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) escalate, the U.S. could be involved. Similarly, U.S. arms sales and commitments to Taiwan mean a PLA attack on Taiwan could trigger U.S. intervention – effectively a proxy conflict scenario.

Historically, the U.S. and China engaged in direct combat in **Korea (1950-53)**, which remains a backdrop for PLA threat perceptions. During the Vietnam War, Chinese personnel provided support to North Vietnam, and a few Chinese died in U.S. bombings, but there was no full-scale clash. One near-conflict was the **1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis**, where Mao’s shelling of offshore islands led President Eisenhower to consider nuclear options; fortunately, it deescalated. Another confrontation was the **1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis** when China tested missiles near Taiwan to protest a U.S. visit by Taiwan’s president; the U.S. responded by deploying aircraft carriers, and China backed down. These incidents underscore how military conflict has been *avoided through U.S. deterrence and diplomacy*, but the risk remains.

On the other hand, the U.S. and Chinese militaries have found common cause in non-traditional security. In 2014, they coordinated in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight. Chinese aircraft helped in the U.S.-led efforts after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Such humanitarian cooperation could be expanded. There is also an arms control element: China isn’t party to U.S.-Russia treaties, but it has engaged in dialogues about **rules of behavior** in space and established a code for unplanned naval encounters (CUES) which both navies follow to avoid incidents at sea. Unfortunately, military ties have frequently been suspended by China as protest (e.g., after U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or sanctions on PLA officers), which hampers building trust.

Areas where U.S. military support has helped China, interestingly, include the 1980s when the U.S. sold China dual-use tech and even military equipment like Black Hawk helicopters, night-vision gear, and artillery locating radars to bolster it against the Soviets. This ended after Tiananmen, when the U.S. and EU imposed an **arms embargo on China** (still in place) because of human rights abuses. As a result, China turned to Russia and others for arms. If not for 1989, U.S.-China might have had deeper mil cooperation. Now, looking forward, potential **future collaboration** might be in areas like anti-piracy (continuing), peacekeeping (training jointly African peacekeepers?), or even coordinated responses to pandemics/natural disasters using military logistics. But overall, the trend is **increased rivalry**. The PLA’s rapid modernization – new aircraft carriers, stealth fighters, anti-ship missiles called “carrier-killers,” etc. – is aimed at countering U.S. military advantages in the Pacific. The U.S., in turn, is forging new defense pacts (AUKUS with UK/Australia for nuclear subs, and strengthening the Quad with India/Japan/Australia) largely to counter China.

In summary, U.S.-China military relations have oscillated from allied (1940s WWII era), to enemies (Korea), to cautious engagement (1990s-2000s), and now to competitive postures. The absence of formal alliance means conflicts are by proxy or risk of accidental clash. Keeping lines of communication open between their militaries is critical to avoid incidents (there have been close calls with ships and planes – e.g., a Chinese jet buzzed a U.S. spy plane in 2023 within 10 feet). Avoiding war while **managing intense military competition** is one of the toughest strategic challenges ahead.

#### **Diplomatic Influence:**

**Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:** China’s diplomatic profile has grown from relatively isolationist in the 1960s to highly engaged today. In its region, China is a **central player in Asian diplomacy**. It is a leading voice in multilateral forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the East Asia Summit, and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). Sometimes it sets up its own platforms – e.g., the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (with Russia and Central Asian states, focusing on security). China’s stance and initiatives often shape regional agendas: for instance, it championed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal, which includes ASEAN, Japan, Korea, Australia, and others, covering about 30% of global GDP. China also spearheaded the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2015 as an alternative development bank where it’s the largest shareholder; many U.S. allies joined AIIB (though the U.S. and Japan did not), showing China’s ability to attract global participation.

In terms of **shaping regional security**, China often positions itself as a critic of U.S. alliances, proposing instead “Asian solutions to Asian problems.” It has tried to broker or mediate in some regional conflicts: a notable recent success was mediating a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in early 2023 – a diplomatic breakthrough achieved in Beijing. This surprised many and signaled China’s willingness to involve itself beyond East Asia. Closer to home, China has been involved in talks about the Afghan conflict (hosting Taliban delegations), and it has floated peace plans for Ukraine (though seen as favoring Russia’s position). In Southeast Asia, China’s diplomacy can be double-edged: it offers economic carrots but also applies pressure on South China Sea claimants to deal with disputes bilaterally rather than via international law (rejecting a 2016 UNCLOS tribunal ruling that favored the Philippines). Still, China presents itself as a proponent of multilateralism when it suits its interests – it frequently invokes the UN and has Chinese nationals leading some UN agencies (e.g., FAO, ITU in recent years).

On the **global stage**, China is arguably the No. 2 power in diplomatic influence after the U.S. It is a permanent UN Security Council member, using its veto sparingly (more often in tandem with Russia on issues like Syria). It has promoted concepts like the “Community of Shared Future for Mankind” at the UN – broad strokes about development and sovereignty. China’s Belt and Road Initiative also has a diplomatic dimension: it has built a large coalition (the BRI forum sees attendance from dozens of heads of state) and this translates into influence in those countries (often support for China’s positions in international bodies, e.g., votes in the UN Human Rights Council to block resolutions criticizing China). In institutions like the WTO, China’s role is complex: it benefited from the trading system but is now seen as bending rules (like subsidizing industries), so U.S. diplomacy tries to rally partners to reform WTO rules to address China. Conversely, China aligns with developing nations in calling for a more multipolar world and more voice for the Global South. It’s a key player in groups like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) which seek to challenge Western dominance in global finance and politics – e.g., pushing for alternatives to the dollar.

For the U.S., China’s diplomatic influence can be both an obstacle and an opportunity. It’s an obstacle when China shields problematic regimes from pressure (like vetoing tougher action on Myanmar after the coup, or watering down sanctions on North Korea). But it’s an opportunity in that **China can be a conduit to actors the U.S. struggles with** – e.g., persuading North Korea to negotiate, influencing Pakistan to stabilize Afghanistan, or contributing to African peacekeeping where U.S. footprint is limited. If the U.S. leverages China’s regional clout positively, Beijing could help enforce peace deals or coordinate aid (for example, China co-chaired donor conferences for Afghanistan in the past). However, if left unchecked, China could also create parallel international norms that conflict with liberal values (for example, promoting its model of internet sovereignty vs. the open internet favored by the U.S.).

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:** There is significant potential for U.S.-China cooperation in multilateral settings to resolve conflicts – provided political will exists on both sides. Historically, a great example is the **Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA)** in 2015: China was part of the P5+1 and constructively supported the agreement that curtailed Iran’s nuclear program. Should there be a revival or a similar negotiation, U.S. and Chinese diplomats working in concert would be vital. In the **Korean Peninsula issue**, a multilateral framework (the Six-Party Talks) previously included the U.S., China, and others, and achieved at least interim agreements. Reviving something similar likely requires U.S.-China coordination – China hosting talks or enforcing any outcome.

The United Nations is the primary venue for conflict resolution. The U.S. and China have cooperated on **peacekeeping mandates** – for instance, both agreed on missions in Africa like in South Sudan (where China even contributed troops, given its oil interests there). They could jointly sponsor resolutions to strengthen peace processes in conflict zones where both have interest (like stabilizing Congo, or anti-piracy off Somalia which turned into on-shore efforts to rebuild Somalia). On climate-related conflicts, both could lead on initiatives to help regions like the Sahel adapt (reducing conflict drivers).

Another area of multilateral importance is global health (a security issue now). The U.S. and China could spearhead conflict resolution in terms of **pandemic response** – for example, in ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines, which helps prevent international discord over resources. They did collaborate in the early 2000s against SARS and avian flu via WHO channels.

However, multilateral conflict resolution efforts can also be stymied by U.S.-China rivalry if not careful. For instance, in the **South China Sea disputes**, ASEAN-led multilateral talks have been undermined because China prefers one-on-one dealings where its power dominates, whereas the U.S. supports a multilateral code of conduct. Perhaps a compromise is U.S. encouraging China to finalize a binding Code of Conduct with ASEAN (something long under negotiation) by offering recognition of China’s legitimate interests if it commits to no militarization or coercion. That would be a cooperative multilateral outcome.

In potential hotspots like *the Middle East*, now that China has shown initiative in Saudi-Iran, the U.S. could tacitly coordinate – both want a stable Gulf (China for oil, U.S. for global security). Perhaps a joint or parallel effort to end the Yemen war or to manage Sudan’s civil strife could be envisioned, leveraging China’s ties with certain factions and U.S. ties with others.

The **United Nations Security Council** remains key. When U.S. and China agree, things move – e.g., tough sanctions on North Korea in 2017 (after its ICBM tests) passed with China’s yes vote, which was critical. If a new conflict erupts, getting China on board with UN action (peacekeepers, sanctions on aggressors) can make or break the response. Conversely, if China is the aggressor (say, in Taiwan), it would veto any UN action against itself – a scenario the U.S. aims to avoid through deterrence.

Ultimately, the potential for cooperation exists in addressing **shared threats** like pandemics, climate, nuclear proliferation, and transnational crime. By building bilateral trust and proving through small steps that working together yields benefits, larger conflict-resolution collaboration becomes possible. A near-term goal might be establishing a **U.S.-China Crisis Management dialogue** – a formal channel where both consult on emerging conflicts (e.g., if a war threatens to break out in a third region, the U.S. and China discuss how to jointly de-escalate it). This could institutionalize cooperation in conflict resolution and reassure the world that the two great powers can act as pillars of stability rather than opposing poles pulling it apart.

### **3\. Current Challenges and Opportunities**

#### **Political & Governance Issues:**

**Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:** China’s governance under the CCP presents serious human rights challenges that have impacted its relations with the U.S. The government continues to prioritize regime stability and ideological control over democratic reforms or civil liberties. Over the past decade, **political repression has intensified** – censorship of media and the internet is near-total (the “Great Firewall” blocks foreign news and social media), dissidents are routinely surveilled or detained, and ethnic and religious minorities face harsh treatment. The most egregious example is in **Xinjiang**, where since 2017 up to one million Uyghur and other Muslim minorities were reportedly held in re-education camps, subjected to forced labor and intrusive surveillance, prompting the U.S. to sanction Chinese officials and label it a genocide ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=Freedom%20House%20released%20its%20Freedom,and%20Tibet%20are%20listed%20separately)). In **Hong Kong**, the imposition of the National Security Law in 2020 effectively criminalized dissent, dismantling freedoms promised under the One Country, Two Systems framework. Pro-democracy activists have been jailed or exiled, and independent media shut down. In Tibet and Inner Mongolia, authorities have suppressed local languages and traditions, drawing criticism from rights groups. The **rule of law** in China is subservient to the Party – courts have a \>99% conviction rate and lack independence. High-profile incidents like the secret detention of legal scholar Xu Zhiyong or tennis star Peng Shuai’s temporary disappearance after accusing a former official highlight arbitrary justice. These human rights issues directly impact bilateral relations: U.S. officials have made them a point of contention, from raising them in summits ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Xi%20says%20the%20countries%20need,the%20island%20has%20not%20changed)) to implementing targeted sanctions (e.g., the Global Magnitsky sanctions on Xinjiang officials, import bans on Xinjiang cotton and tomatoes due to forced labor). For the U.S., China’s domestic repression is not only a moral concern but also affects soft power and public opinion – Americans broadly view China’s government negatively in light of such abuses. Conversely, Chinese leaders bristle at what they see as U.S. interference in internal affairs, making human rights a perennial sore spot that complicates cooperation in other areas.

These governance issues impact bilateral relations by limiting areas of engagement. For instance, legal cooperation or extradition treaties are impossible due to lack of judicial independence. Cultural and educational exchanges have suffered – the U.S. ordered the closure of China’s Houston consulate in 2020 partly over espionage concerns, and China expelled some U.S. journalists – a tit-for-tat fueled by mistrust in governance and openness. Nonetheless, there are ongoing dialogues: the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and human rights envoys continue to press for the release of political prisoners and better treatment of minorities, albeit with minimal success so far. The tension is that the U.S. wants to uphold universal values, while China’s leadership sees those calls as existential threats to CCP rule.

**Government Stability and Policy Continuity:** Internally, China’s political system is stable in the sense that the CCP faces no organized opposition – it has maintained an unbroken hold on power for over 70 years. The leadership transition used to be institutionalized with two-term limits for presidents and collective decision-making in the Politburo. However, under Xi Jinping, there’s been a significant centralization of authority. In 2022, Xi secured a norm-breaking third term as CCP General Secretary and purged rival factions, installing loyalists in key positions. This creates *stability at the top, but also vulnerability*: power is highly personalized, and if something were to happen to Xi or if public discontent erupted, the lack of alternative leadership or outlets could cause a sudden crisis. So far, **policy continuity under Xi has been strong** – he launched big campaigns (anti-corruption, poverty alleviation) and achieved them, and there is consistency in his assertive foreign policy and tight domestic control. The anti-corruption campaign, while popular for punishing graft (disciplining **over 6 million officials since 2013 ([RPT BREAKINGVIEWS Xi Jinping’s graft crackdown is fight without end | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/xi-jinpings-graft-crackdown-is-fight-without-end-2025-02-19/#:~:text=HONG%20KONG%2C%20Feb%2019%20,ineffective%20at%20dealing%20with%20it))**), also instilled fear in bureaucracy, leading to risk-averse officials (“policymaking paralysis” as noted by commentators ([RPT BREAKINGVIEWS Xi Jinping’s graft crackdown is fight without end | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/xi-jinpings-graft-crackdown-is-fight-without-end-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20it,18%20trillion%20economy%20more%20efficient))). This means sometimes local governance can be erratic – e.g., overzealous implementation of zero-COVID rules that led to public backlash.

Social stability is maintained through a massive security apparatus – spending on internal security rivals the defense budget. Occasional protests (labor strikes, environmental protests, localized riots) do occur but are swiftly contained. The 2019 Hong Kong protests and the 2022 anti-lockdown protests were exceptional in scale but ultimately the government reasserted control (by law in HK, by policy change in the mainland). **For U.S.-China relations**, China’s internal stability implies the U.S. generally deals with the same regime and can plan long-term, but it also means sudden policy shifts can occur if Beijing perceives internal threats. For example, if nationalism is needed to distract from domestic woes, Beijing might be less compromising in foreign disputes. Conversely, if economic troubles threaten legitimacy, China might moderate internationally to ensure access to trade and investment.

One notable area of policy continuity is China’s core interests: regime security, sovereignty (Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet), and economic development. These have remained unchanged across leadership changes. However, Xi’s era added a stronger ideological tone (revival of Marxism and Party ideology) and reduced the previous emphasis on keeping a low profile internationally. That means the U.S. can expect a more ideologically assertive China for the foreseeable future. No significant **power shifts or protests** currently endanger the government, but things to watch include elite dissatisfaction (if Xi’s policies severely harm the economy, grumblings within the party could grow) or popular anger (if unemployment stays high, or another crisis like a poorly handled disaster occurs). From the U.S. perspective, a more pluralistic or democratic China is not on the horizon; instead, dealing with a strong one-man-led authoritarian system is the reality.

**What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.** Despite strategic rivalry, the U.S. and China are jointly party to numerous international agreements and organizations, which provide channels for engagement:

* **United Nations (UN):** Both are founding members of the UN and permanent members of the UN Security Council, sharing responsibility for international peace and security. They work together (and sometimes at odds) in the General Assembly and various UN programs.

* **World Trade Organization (WTO):** Both the U.S. and China are WTO members (China joined in 2001). WTO membership binds them to common trade rules and offers a forum (dispute settlement mechanism) to handle trade grievances – indeed both have filed cases against each other there.

* **International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank:** Both are members and large shareholders in the Bretton Woods institutions. They collaborate (e.g., co-financing projects in Afghanistan pre-2021) and negotiate through these bodies on global economic policies.

* **G20:** Both sit in the G20 major economies forum, which has been a key venue for economic coordination, including during the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic economic responses.

* **Paris Climate Agreement:** Both the U.S. and China are parties to the Paris Agreement on climate change (the U.S. rejoined in 2021 after a brief withdrawal). They thus share commitments to emissions targets and meet in Conference of Parties (COP) summits.

* **Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT):** Both are signatories (China as one of the five nuclear-weapon states, the U.S. as another). They have obligations under the NPT to work toward disarmament and prevent proliferation. They also both supported the extension of the NPT indefinitely in 1995\.

* **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC):** Both have signed these treaties banning chemical and biological arms.

* **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO):** Both are members (important for managing air travel standards; relevant recently in disputes like over Taiwan’s flight zones).

* **World Health Organization (WHO):** Both participate in WHO, critical for pandemic cooperation. (However, tensions arose over the COVID origins probe, but they remain in the organization).

* **ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF):** Both the U.S. and China are members of this Asia-Pacific security dialogue platform under ASEAN’s auspices, discussing regional security issues.

* **APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation):** Both are members of this forum aimed at promoting free trade and economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim.

* **Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime:** China is notably *not* a member of these Western-led export control regimes (for arms and dual-use tech), which is a gap. But both are in the **Nuclear Suppliers Group** (actually China did join NSG, which controls nuclear-related exports).

* **International agreements**: Both have signed the **Montreal Protocol** (ozone-depleting substances), various **fisheries and maritime agreements**, and UN conventions like the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) – China and the U.S. are parties to UNCAC, a tool potentially to cooperate on anti-corruption.

* **Space:** Both have signed the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 (peaceful use of space) even though competition in space is rising.

While not a treaty or organization, it’s worth noting **bilateral dialogues and memoranda**: the U.S. and China have (or had) dozens of bilateral agreements from science and technology cooperation (the S\&T Agreement recently renewed), educational exchange agreements (like the Fulbright in the past, now suspended by U.S.), to military CBMs (MOUs on maritime and air encounters). They also share a commitment via the **UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** and initiatives like the **Global Methane Pledge** (China hasn’t formally joined that pledge yet, but is part of methane dialogues).

Listing them shows that despite tensions, the U.S. and China operate within many of the same global frameworks, giving them common reference points and obligations. Leveraging these shared memberships can help hold China to international standards (e.g., appealing to WTO rules in trade disputes, or using UN mechanisms to encourage China’s compliance on sanctions).

#### **Economic & Trade Concerns:**

**Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:** A primary U.S. concern has been the **trade imbalance** – the U.S. imports far more from China than it exports. In 2022, the U.S. trade deficit with China was around $382.9 billion ([\[PDF\] U.S. Trade with China 2022 \- Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file#:~:text=,of%20%28%2429.4%20billion%29)). This imbalance is driven by structural factors: China’s role as an export manufacturing hub, its high savings rate, and various trade practices. The U.S. has accused China of unfair practices such as **currency manipulation** in the past (keeping the yuan undervalued to boost exports, though in recent years that claim has faded), **intellectual property theft** through forced tech transfer or cyber-espionage, industrial subsidies (especially under the “Made in China 2025” plan which aimed for dominance in high-tech sectors), and restricted market access for foreign firms. In response, the U.S. applied tariffs on roughly $360 billion of Chinese goods starting 2018 (with rates up to 25% on many categories). China retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, hitting agriculture hardest. This **trade war** created frictions that persist: most of those tariffs remain as of 2025\.

Sanctions beyond tariffs have also come into play. The U.S. has sanctioned Chinese tech companies like Huawei and ZTE (restricting their access to U.S. tech and markets) due to security concerns. In 2022, the U.S. implemented sweeping **export controls on semiconductor technology to China** ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20U,still%20lacks%20the%20ability%20to)), barring Chinese firms from obtaining cutting-edge chips and equipment that use U.S. tech, citing both human rights (surveillance uses) and military considerations. China views these as aggressive attempts to contain its development. On the Chinese side, they have sometimes unofficially sanctioned U.S. or allied businesses – for instance, halting rare earth exports to Japan in 2010, or boycotting South Korean goods over a U.S. THAAD missile defense deployment. With the U.S., China’s retaliations include putting some U.S. companies on an “unreliable entities” list and restricting exports of certain materials like gallium and germanium (critical for semiconductors) in 2023, seemingly as counter-measures.

Market access issues remain prominent. U.S. financial firms and automakers have gained somewhat more access over time (China lifted some joint-venture requirements in auto and finance sectors recently). Yet sectors like cloud computing, social media, and entertainment remain heavily restricted or censored (e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter are blocked; Hollywood films face quota limits and content censors). The U.S. also objects to China’s use of **state subsidies** and support for state-owned enterprises, which distort competition. China argues the U.S. has its own protectionist measures (pointing to the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize U.S. industries).

Another concern is **China’s use of economic coercion**: punishing countries economically for political disagreements (like cutting off imports of Australian coal and wine after Australia sought a COVID origins inquiry, or banning Canadian canola over the Huawei CFO arrest). The U.S. is working with allies on an “economic security” agenda to collectively resist such coercion (possibly coordinating responses). On the U.S. domestic front, public opinion has soured on trade with China as factories closed; thus, both political parties now favor a tougher line, including tariffs and **keeping certain Chinese companies (like TikTok)** under scrutiny or bans for data security.

Financially, China’s large holdings of U.S. debt and its role in supply chains means a sudden decoupling could hurt the U.S. as well (higher consumer prices, etc.), so both sides have reason to moderate – and indeed trade in goods hit a record high in 2022 despite the tariffs, showing ongoing strong ties. But **tensions in high-tech and strategic industries are acute**: the U.S. has effectively barred China’s largest chipmaker (SMIC) from advanced tooling, and China in turn is accelerating self-reliance, which may result in parallel tech ecosystems.

**Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:** Even with these frictions, there are potential opportunities to recalibrate economic ties. One possibility is negotiating a **Phase Two** trade agreement that addresses deeper issues like subsidies and IP. China indicated willingness to reform its intellectual property regime (it has strengthened IP laws, partly for its own companies’ benefit too) and reduce forced tech transfers; a deal could formalize those commitments in exchange for tariff relief. Another opportunity could be in the realm of **services trade** – U.S. firms in finance, insurance, health, and education have expertise that China’s growing middle class wants. If China further opens these sectors (e.g., allowing majority foreign-owned insurance or hospitals), it could be win-win.

The two countries could also partner in **global infrastructure or development finance**. For instance, under the right circumstances, U.S. and Chinese development banks could co-finance projects in third countries (it has happened in the past in places like Pakistan’s power sector). A coordinated approach under something like the G20 could ensure that BRI projects meet certain standards, potentially involving U.S. companies as contractors or suppliers, turning competition into some cooperation.

In technology, while there’s competition, there might be scope for **setting common standards**. If U.S. and Chinese experts co-develop standards for things like electric vehicle charging, AI ethics, or 5G/6G interoperability, it could actually expand markets for both rather than splinter them. A potential partnership could be forged in **green technology**: China leads in manufacturing solar panels and batteries cheaply; the U.S. leads in some clean tech R\&D. Together they could drive down costs of renewable energy globally. The U.S. could export more LNG to help China transition off coal (already happening to some extent) – which is both an economic and environmental opportunity.

Regionally, if the geopolitical climate improved, the U.S. might consider cooperating with Chinese-led trade initiatives. While joining RCEP or CPTPP with China is politically unlikely for the U.S. now, there could be sectoral agreements – like a **plurilateral deal on e-commerce** or digital trade including both countries to ensure a free and fair digital economy.

Finally, **people-to-people economic ties** like tourism and education can rebound post-pandemic – Chinese tourism to the U.S. and vice versa was huge (like 3 million Chinese visitors annually pre-2018). If visa and travel issues are smoothed, that’s economic benefit. Chinese students in U.S. universities, previously bringing billions in tuition and fostering innovation, could be welcomed under balanced security scrutiny, which helps maintain soft ties and economic input (as many stay and start businesses).

In summary, while strategic competition frames a lot of the economic discourse, there are clear mutual gains in a stable, rules-based trading relationship. **Negotiating updated trade understandings** – possibly with allies as part of it (like a U.S.-EU-Japan united front to push China on subsidies, which then leads to an agreement where China disciplines its SOEs in return for better integration) – could rejuvenate the economic partnership to more sustainable grounds.

#### **Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

**Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:** Several regional conflicts and alliance dynamics directly impact U.S.-China relations:

* **Taiwan:** This is the *most sensitive and potentially explosive issue*. China’s position is that Taiwan is part of China, and it has not renounced use of force to achieve unification. The U.S. position, under the Taiwan Relations Act, is to provide Taiwan defensive arms and treat any coercive change in Taiwan’s status as “of grave concern”. The informal U.S. security commitment to Taiwan acts as a deterrent to a Chinese invasion. However, Chinese military pressure around Taiwan has grown (frequent incursions into Taiwan’s air defense zone, big exercises like post-Pelosi’s visit ([Series: The Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis | ChinaPower Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/series-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/#:~:text=When%20then,after%20Pelosi%E2%80%99s%20trip%20to%20Taiwan))). Any conflict over Taiwan could directly pit U.S. and Chinese forces against each other, a scenario both sides try to avoid via deterrence and maintaining the status quo (the U.S. follows a One-China policy but insists on peaceful resolution). The Taiwan issue pervades all aspects of bilateral ties – for instance, China often suspends talks when U.S. sells new arms to Taipei. Managing this requires careful signaling: U.S. wants to support Taiwan’s self-defense without provoking Beijing to act rashly; China wants to prevent “independence” moves and discourage external support for Taiwan.

* **South China Sea:** This regional conflict involves China’s overlapping maritime and territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei (and indirectly Indonesia). China’s building of artificial islands and militarization of outposts (runways, missile batteries) has militarized what used to be reefs. The U.S., though not a claimant, conducts freedom of navigation operations to challenge China’s excessive claims and supports Southeast Asian nations’ rights under international law (backing the 2016 arbitration that invalidated China’s nine-dash line). This theater has seen near-collisions between U.S. Navy ships and Chinese vessels. It affects U.S.-China ties as U.S. naval presence is seen by China as interference, yet the U.S. sees China’s actions as bullying allies and threatening an open sea lane. Alliances are invoked: The Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally, had Scarborough Shoal taken de facto by China in 2012; if a Philippine vessel is attacked, the U.S. might be obliged to respond (as clarified by U.S. in 2019 that the mutual defense treaty covers South China Sea). Thus, small incidents could escalate. The U.S. has been strengthening military cooperation with the Philippines and others as a counter, which China decries.

* **North Korea:** North Korea’s rogue nuclear program is a major security issue where U.S. and China have overlapping concerns but different priorities. China is North Korea’s ally (albeit a frustrated one) and economic lifeline; the U.S. is North Korea’s adversary. Chinese alliance with Pyongyang (1961 treaty) means in theory China could be drawn in if conflict resumed on the peninsula – a nightmare scenario reminiscent of 1950\. However, China does not want Kim Jong-un to provoke war; it wants stability. The U.S. alliance with South Korea and troops stationed there are seen by China as a containment threat, but also serve as a stabilizing factor. Conflict on the Korean Peninsula would definitely affect U.S.-China: likely U.S. and Chinese forces might race to secure or support different sides. Thankfully, all prefer diplomacy for now, but North Korean missile tests (some flew toward waters near China too) keep tensions high.

* **India and Quadrilateral (Quad) alliance:** India-China border clashes (like the deadly Galwan clash in 2020\) have pushed India closer to the U.S. strategically. The U.S. has fostered the Quad (U.S., India, Japan, Australia) as a grouping to promote a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”, implicitly balancing China. China sees these growing ties as forming an anti-China alliance. While not a formal military pact, enhanced U.S.-India defense cooperation, U.S. support for India in disputes (like rhetorically backing India’s stance in border tensions), and joint naval exercises (Malabar) are all viewed suspiciously by Beijing. This can fuel a security dilemma: China may respond by strengthening its partnership with Russia or Pakistan, or increasing presence in the Indian Ocean (worrying India further). U.S.-China relations thus are affected by this evolving quasi-alliance – positive if China moderates due to a united front, negative if it leads to arms races.

* **Alliances in East Asia:** U.S. bilateral alliances with Japan and South Korea are cornerstones of its presence. China disputes Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islets; the U.S. has said those are covered by the U.S.-Japan defense treaty, meaning if conflict occurred there, U.S. military support would activate ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Largest%20U,Line)). This deters China but also is a sticking point (China sees it as U.S. siding with Japan in territorial issue). Likewise, increased trilateral coordination among U.S., Japan, ROK (e.g., on missile defense against North Korea) is interpreted by China as encirclement. On the flip side, if North Korea attacked, China’s treaty could technically put it in opposition to U.S.-ROK forces, but realistically China would likely avoid direct conflict and push de-escalation.

**Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**

* **Terrorism:** As noted, both nations oppose international terrorism, but collaboration has been limited partly due to mistrust. China tends to label its internal dissenters (like Uyghur separatists or Falun Gong) as “terrorists,” which the U.S. does not fully buy into. However, they have cooperated on designating certain groups (ETIM was once on a U.S. terror list, now removed in 2020, which displeased China). A risk is that a terror attack (say by ISIS or Al Qaeda affiliates) on either country could affect their cooperation or conflict – e.g., if an attack in the U.S. had any connection to Pakistan or Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, the U.S. might expect China to use its influence there to crack down. If China suffers an attack and blames militants in SE Asia, it may push U.S. ally governments to act.

* **Cybersecurity:** Cyber is a domain of significant tension. The U.S. has accused China’s state-sponsored hackers of massive intellectual property theft (e.g., hacking into U.S. companies to steal trade secrets) and breaches like the 2015 OPM hack (compromising millions of U.S. federal employees’ data). China denies state involvement, though a 2014 U.S. indictment of PLA officers for cyber theft ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Labels%20China%20a%20Currency)) and other evidence says otherwise. In 2015, the two countries reached a cyber agreement not to steal trade secrets for commercial gain, which led to a temporary drop in Chinese hacking ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Labels%20China%20a%20Currency)), but it’s unclear if that holds now. The risk of a **cyber escalation** is that one side’s cyberattack could inadvertently hit critical infrastructure (power grids, hospitals) and be seen as an act of war. The U.S. worries about Chinese malware in infrastructure and espionage via telecom (hence bans on Huawei). Meanwhile, China fears U.S. cyber operations (like NSA spying revealed by Snowden). Building norms or hotlines for cyber incidents is challenging but necessary to avoid escalation due to a cyber misunderstanding.

* **Military Escalation Risks:** There are many flashpoints where an accident or miscalculation could escalate. In the **South China Sea**, a collision between ships or aircraft could escalate if mismanaged (as happened with the EP-3 plane in 2001, resolved diplomatically ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Era%201989%3A%20Tiananmen%20Square%20Massacre,Military%20Spending%202008%3A%20China%20Becomes))). In the **East China Sea**, Chinese and Japanese ships and planes play cat-and-mouse; a mishap there could involve the U.S. due to Japan’s alliance. **Nuclear escalation**: China’s nuclear arsenal is smaller than the U.S.’s but growing; both maintain second-strike capabilities (the U.S. many, China a minimum deterrent), so direct nuclear war is unlikely, but nuclear brinkmanship could come into play in a Taiwan scenario for instance. The Pentagon notes China’s shift toward a launch-on-warning posture ([What the Pentagon’s New Report on Chinese Military Power Reveals About Capabilities, Context, and Consequences \- War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/12/what-the-pentagons-new-report-on-chinese-military-power-reveals-about-capabilities-context-and-consequences/#:~:text=Already%2C%20China%E2%80%99s%20rocket%20force%20keeps,a%20launch%20on%20warning%20posture)), which, if their early warning is less reliable, could cause dangerous miscalculations.

Another risk is **space**: China has developed anti-satellite missiles (tested in 2007, creating space debris) and the U.S. has its own ASAT capabilities; war could extend to knocking out satellites, crippling communications. Both have formed space forces or units; establishing norms to avoid targeting each other’s critical satellites in any skirmish is an emerging need.

**Emerging threats** include China potentially placing assets in strategic areas (e.g., a PLA naval base in the Atlantic – rumored interest in Equatorial Guinea – which U.S. would see as threat). The U.S. making new security pacts (like inviting others into AUKUS) could further alarm China. Additionally, **grey-zone tactics** (China using militia boats, drones, or economic coercion below the threshold of war) risk inadvertent escalation if a U.S. ally responds forcibly.

Future risks: if China’s military reaches near-parity regionally by 2035 (1,500 nuclear warheads, blue-water navy etc.), the balance of power shifts could embolden risk-taking or raise chances of misjudging each other’s resolve. The U.S. aims to mitigate this by strengthening deterrence and communication (hence urging China to have military hotlines active – currently China sometimes doesn’t pick up calls during crises, which is worrying).

In summary, **the U.S. and China face a security paradox**: preparation for worst-case scenarios (like conflict over Taiwan) can itself heighten suspicion and arms racing, fueling the very risks they seek to deter. Managing this requires transparency, dialogue, and confidence-building measures (like advance notice of major exercises, agreements on avoiding dangerous air/naval maneuvers – some of which exist but need reinforcement).

#### **Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

**Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:** People-to-people ties between Americans and Chinese have historically been a stabilizing force, creating goodwill and mutual understanding, but have come under strain recently.

* **Migration:** The Chinese diaspora in the U.S. is large and influential. About **2.4 million Chinese immigrants** live in the U.S. (2019 data) ([Chinese Immigrants in the United States \- Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/chinese-immigrants-united-states-2021#:~:text=Institute%20www,a%20long%20period%20of)), and in total roughly **5 million** Americans are of Chinese descent (including U.S.-born) ([Chinese Americans: A Survey Data Snapshot | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/08/06/chinese-americans-a-survey-data-snapshot/#:~:text=About%204,nation%E2%80%99s%20total%20Asian%20American%20population)) – the largest Asian-American group. These immigrants often maintain family ties to China and can act as informal bridges. However, China’s government sometimes tries to leverage the diaspora for influence (through outreach or United Front Work), which U.S. authorities are wary of. Conversely, Chinese-American communities have expressed fear of backlash amid geopolitical tensions (as seen in a spike in anti-Asian hate incidents during COVID).

There is also **recent migration in the other direction**: many Chinese studied or worked in the U.S. and some returned home with expertise, contributing to China’s development. Lately, more wealthy Chinese are emigrating due to domestic crackdowns or seeking better education for children; the U.S. remains a top destination (through investor visas, etc.). Interestingly, an increasing number of Chinese nationals have sought asylum in the U.S., citing political or religious persecution. In 2023, there was a notable surge of Chinese migrants arriving via the U.S.-Mexico border – about **37,000 Chinese encountered at the border in 2023, nearly 10× the prior year ([2024 Chinese Migrants To US Is Nothing New – But The Reasons For Recent Surge At Southern Border Are](https://umbc.edu/stories/chinese-migrants-to-us/#:~:text=While%20a%20record%202,about%2037%2C000%20were%20from%20China))** – driven by China’s economic slowdown and political tightening ([2024 Chinese Migrants To US Is Nothing New – But The Reasons For Recent Surge At Southern Border Are](https://umbc.edu/stories/chinese-migrants-to-us/#:~:text=The%20dramatic%20uptick%20is%20the,how%20to%20make%20the%20trip)). This new refugee flow is an emerging humanitarian issue in bilateral context: the U.S. might need to adjust policies and China may react negatively to U.S. acceptance of these asylum-seekers.

* **Cultural Exchange:** For decades, educational exchanges have been robust. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students enroll in U.S. colleges; in 2020 there were around 370,000, though COVID and visa hurdles reduced it to \~290,000 by 2022\. They contribute significantly to U.S. university finances and often stay to work in STEM fields, benefiting the U.S. economy. The U.S. also sends students to China (though far fewer, in the low thousands) to study language and culture. Programs like the Fulbright (which was suspended in China in 2020 by the U.S. as relations soured) and Peace Corps (which was in China until 2020\) have helped mutual understanding. There are also **tourism exchanges**: China was one of the biggest sources of tourists to America (around 3 million visits per year pre-2019) and vice versa about 1 million Americans visited China annually. These have dropped drastically due to pandemic and travel restrictions, but reopening provides a chance to rebuild.

Public diplomacy initiatives have seen ups and downs: China’s government funded Confucius Institutes to teach Chinese in U.S. schools, but many closed amid concerns they spread propaganda. Meanwhile, U.S. cultural centers in China face restrictions.

* **Public Opinion:** Polls indicate that American views of China have turned sharply negative (around 80% unfavorable in Pew surveys, an all-time high) due to issues like trade, COVID, and human rights. Chinese public opinion of the U.S. is also quite negative, influenced by nationalist media narratives painting the U.S. as trying to thwart China. This mutual distrust among the public makes diplomatic compromises harder (leaders fear looking weak). For example, any U.S. softening on China can draw domestic criticism (accusations of appeasing an authoritarian regime), while any Chinese concession to the U.S. might be spun as kowtowing to foreign pressure. That said, there are constituencies that favor stable ties – U.S. businesses, many Chinese urban youth who admire certain aspects of American culture, etc.

Culturally, the two societies have significant exchanges in film, art, and sports (e.g., the NBA is hugely popular in China, Hollywood movies earn big money there but also face censorship). American brands and values have had broad influence in China’s middle class lifestyle, and Chinese culture (food, acupuncture, martial arts, etc.) is well appreciated in the U.S.

**Shared or Divergent Societal Values:** There are both shared human values and deep differences. At a basic level, both Americans and Chinese value family, education, and prosperity. Chinese-Americans in the U.S. integrate these values and demonstrate the compatibility of personal industriousness and entrepreneurship across cultures. Both societies have strong national pride, though expressed differently.

However, on governance and individual rights, values diverge significantly. The U.S. emphasizes freedom of speech, religion, and the individual’s rights vis-à-vis the state. China’s system prioritizes collective stability, economic rights over political rights, and respect for authority. Concepts like democracy and human rights are thus areas of ideological contention. The Chinese government often propagates that Western-style democracy leads to chaos and that its model better suits Chinese civilization. Many Chinese citizens, influenced by controlled media, may view U.S. calls for democracy as hypocritical or a cover for keeping China down. Meanwhile, Americans see China’s lack of political freedom as at odds with modern values and a moral concern.

Despite that, there’s a segment of Chinese society (intellectuals, some youth) that aspires to greater freedom and admires U.S. openness. And conversely, some Americans question aspects of their own system and see merits in how China achieved rapid poverty reduction and infrastructure development (though not endorsing authoritarianism).

Socially, issues like gender equality or environmentalism have somewhat convergent values recently: China, for example, now talks about climate responsibility and has a growing feminist movement (albeit suppressed). The U.S. and China both officially value family – but differ on e.g. LGBTQ rights (the U.S. has seen progress in acceptance, while China remains conservative and occasionally censors LGBTQ content). Religion is another sphere: the U.S. is pluralistic and free, China’s officially atheist state controls religious practice (particularly for groups it distrusts like underground churches or Muslims).

These societal value differences sometimes spill into diplomacy – e.g., U.S. pushing religious freedom for Tibetans or Uyghurs; China accusing U.S. of racial injustice like referencing Black Lives Matter protests to deflect criticism.

In track-two dialogues, bridging cultural understanding is a constant effort. Sister city programs, academic collaborations, and professional exchanges (like U.S. and Chinese journalists visiting each other’s countries) help chip away at stereotypes. A shared interest in things like science and innovation could unite societies – e.g., both have celebrated scientists collaborating on cancer research (when politics allow).

In sum, people-to-people and cultural dynamics are a double-edged element of U.S.-China relations. When nurtured, they build resilience in the relationship by humanizing each side. When severed or manipulated, they feed mistrust and nationalist fervor. Re-engaging on this front – resuming large-scale educational exchanges, encouraging tourism, protecting diaspora rights – is an opportunity to stabilize long-term relations, though the two governments will have to manage espionage suspicions and propaganda concerns carefully.

#### **Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

**Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:** Both the U.S. and China are experiencing significant impacts from climate change, which in turn affects their economies and security. China, in particular, has seen **intensifying heat waves and shifting rainfall patterns**. In the summer of 2022, China underwent its worst heatwave on record and drought in decades, drying up parts of the Yangtze River, crippling hydropower in Sichuan, and causing power rationing for factories ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20average%20national%20temperatures,northwest%2C%20the%20Blue%20Book%20said)) ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=The%20weather%20bureau%20said%20on,consecutive%20summer%20of%20extreme%20heat)). This disrupted global supply chains (for example, electronics manufacturing slowed due to power cuts). Also, heavier rains have caused deadly floods – in 2021, unprecedented rains in Henan province killed hundreds (subway flooding in Zhengzhou city made international headlines). Chinese authorities warn that these extremes will worsen in coming years ([China warns of hotter, longer heatwaves as climate change intensifies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-weather-authority-warns-high-summer-temperatures-2024-07-04/#:~:text=BEIJING%2FSINGAPORE%2C%20July%204%20%28Reuters%29%20,braces%20for%20another%20scorching%20summer)), threatening food security (north China’s wheat belt faces drought risk) and coastal cities (Shanghai and Guangzhou are at risk from sea level rise and stronger typhoons). Similarly, the U.S. is hit by climate disasters: massive wildfires in the West, stronger hurricanes battering the Gulf and East coasts, heatwaves, and floods. Both nations incur huge economic losses from these events.

Resource scarcity driven by climate is a concern. In China’s case, melting Himalayan glaciers threaten long-term water supply to rivers that hundreds of millions rely on; also, water scarcity in the North China Plain could reduce crop yields. The U.S. faces water scarcity in the Southwest (Colorado River basin) and more frequent crop failures in some areas due to weather extremes. These stresses can induce domestic instability (e.g., farmers’ protests, higher food prices) and also have foreign policy implications (contributing to conflicts or migration abroad).

Notably, China’s per capita emissions have grown to about 8 tons CO₂ (on par with the EU average) ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Global%20environmental%20problems%20cannot%20be,economy%20is%20also%20an%20important)), while the U.S. is around 15 tons. Both suffer air pollution issues (China’s smog has been severe, though improving after aggressive policies; U.S. still has issues in some cities). So addressing climate change is not just altruistic for either; it’s a domestic necessity. Health-wise, urban populations in both suffer from hotter summers and polluted air exacerbated by climate change.

**Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:** Climate cooperation was once a bright spot in U.S.-China relations – they together brokered the Paris Agreement in 2015 ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Hong%20Kong%20Protesters%202020%3A%20%E2%80%98Phase)). There is scope to rebuild that cooperation, as both have pledged significant targets (China aims to peak CO₂ emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Global%20environmental%20problems%20cannot%20be,economy%20is%20also%20an%20important)); the U.S. aims for net-zero by 2050). Some areas for collaboration:

* **Clean Energy Technology:** The U.S. leads in certain innovations (e.g., advanced nuclear reactor design, some aspects of carbon capture, R\&D in hydrogen), while China leads in scaling up manufacturing (solar panels, wind turbines, batteries). Joint research or at least knowledge sharing could accelerate breakthroughs. For example, a partnership on improving battery energy density or safety would benefit both electric vehicle industries.

* **Electric Vehicles (EVs):** Both countries have large EV markets. Standards coordination (charging infrastructure compatibility, etc.) and co-investment in battery recycling can be fruitful.

* **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS):** China still builds coal plants, and the U.S. has many too; working together on economically viable CCS technology could reduce emissions while allowing energy security. Demonstration projects in China with U.S. expertise could be mutually beneficial.

* **Methane Reduction:** Both signed the Global Methane Pledge in principle. They can cooperate to plug methane leaks from oil/gas operations (U.S. tech applied in Chinese fields) and improve livestock management to cut methane.

* **Forestry and conservation:** As major countries with significant forest cover (the U.S.) or reforestation campaigns (China), collaborating on forest carbon sink preservation, anti-desertification (China has expertise greening deserts), and biodiversity (both signed the Convention on Biological Diversity, though U.S. not formally ratified) can build goodwill.

* **Green finance:** Encouraging investment in sustainable infrastructure. The U.S. could potentially partner with China’s Belt and Road in third countries by jointly financing renewable energy projects instead of coal plants. Already, China announced it will stop building new coal plants abroad. The U.S. and China could co-lead a green development fund for Asia/Africa.

One concrete opportunity: resume the **U.S.-China Climate Working Group** and bilateral summits by climate envoys (John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua have a good rapport). They can coordinate positions for COP meetings, perhaps jointly announcing more ambitious targets which would pressure others to follow.

Another area is **cities and subnational cooperation**: Many U.S. and Chinese cities face climate threats; pairing them in initiatives (like California had direct climate MOUs with Chinese provinces during times when federal was disengaged) can yield localized results (cleaner buses, building efficiency standards, etc.).

**Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:** If climate change is not addressed, the resulting crises could strain U.S.-China relations further or create conflict scenarios:

* **Resource conflicts:** Droughts could prompt countries to divert rivers – e.g., China’s dams on Mekong River have already contributed to lower water downstream, upsetting Southeast Asian neighbors. If such disputes worsen, the U.S. might back the downstream states and criticize China’s practices. Similarly, melting Arctic ice opens new sea routes; both the U.S. and China (as a self-declared “near-Arctic state”) have interests, which could cause friction or require cooperation in a new domain.

* **Humanitarian crises:** Climate impacts might cause humanitarian disasters in the Asia-Pacific (stronger cyclones hitting Pacific islands or South Asian coasts). Both U.S. and Chinese militaries might deploy for disaster relief. If they coordinate (e.g., after a typhoon in the Philippines), it’s a trust-building exercise; if they operate separately without communication, there could be confusion.

* **Climate-driven migration:** In the worst scenarios, climate could displace many (for example, Bangladeshis or Pacific Islanders). The U.S. and China may find themselves dealing with refugee flows or instability in third countries. How they respond (cooperative aid vs. competing influence) will matter.

* **Food security:** China, as a huge food importer, might grab land overseas or dominate grain markets if domestic production falters, which could cause global price spikes. The U.S. as an exporter could either find opportunity or conflict (if China is blamed for hoarding or if U.S. restricts exports for its own inflation control). Transparency and cooperation in global food systems (through FAO, etc.) are crucial to avoid that tension.

Environmental degradation in general can also fuel social unrest that governments scapegoat foreigners for. If pollution or water shortages cause unrest in China, the regime might deflect blame externally, perhaps accusing U.S. sabotage or something – an irrational but possible move when under pressure. Conversely, if the U.S. faces severe climate disasters and sees China not pulling weight on emissions, it could ramp up climate-related trade measures (carbon tariffs), adding to economic conflict.

Thus, fighting climate change together is not just about altruism but preventing future security crises. The cost of inaction or unilateral action is high. A cooperative U.S.-China approach to the environment would greatly enhance global efforts and also serve as a stabilizing pillar in their relationship, demonstrating that even strategic rivals can find common cause against a shared existential threat.

### **4\. Policy Goals**

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

China occupies a central role in Asia and the world, and its cooperation or at least constructive engagement is key for the United States to achieve several regional objectives:

* **Maintaining Peace and Stability:** The U.S. seeks a peaceful Indo-Pacific where no power coercively dominates others. China can aid this goal by *restraining aggressive actions* in flashpoints. For instance, by peacefully managing maritime disputes (agreeing to codes of conduct in the South China Sea, reducing provocative military exercises near Taiwan), China would lower the risk of conflict that could draw in the U.S. Historically, China contributed to stability when it pursued detente with neighbors and confidence-building with rivals – the U.S. would like a return to that approach. Additionally, China’s influence on **North Korea** can help the U.S.: Beijing enforcing sanctions and pressing Pyongyang to freeze nuclear tests supports the U.S. goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. In Afghanistan, a stable outcome with no terror camps aligns with both interests, so China’s economic engagement there (if conditional on Taliban counterterror pledges) also helps a key U.S. regional goal.

* **Counterterrorism and Nonproliferation:** The U.S. wants to prevent terrorist safe havens and the spread of WMD in Asia. China can assist by monitoring and clamping down on extremist networks in its western regions and neighboring Central Asia, sharing intel as appropriate. On nonproliferation, China’s participation in regimes like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and adherence to export controls on sensitive tech (missiles, dual-use goods) helps stop proliferation – e.g., ensuring Chinese firms don’t supply Iran or North Korea illicitly. In the past, China joined sanctions on Iran which helped force Iran to negotiate the nuclear deal. Continued alignment on such sanctions or future diplomatic efforts is something the U.S. expects and values.

* **Economic Order and Connectivity:** The U.S. aims for a free, open, and rules-based economic order in Asia. China, as the largest trading partner for most Asian states, can either reinforce or undermine this. The U.S. wants China to uphold fair trading rules – if China lowers trade barriers, respects intellectual property, and contributes to multilateral trade agreements, it would enhance regional prosperity that benefits everyone (including U.S. exporters). In infrastructure, if China’s Belt and Road projects follow transparent, sustainable practices, they can improve regional connectivity in line with U.S. goals (since better infrastructure in Asia facilitates trade for all). For example, Chinese-built ports or railways can be positive if open to use by all and not military-driven. The U.S. would like China’s help in reforming global trade rules to address new issues (digital trade, environmental standards) rather than see China creating alternate blocs.

* **Global Issues (Climate, Health):** Regionally, challenges like pandemics and climate change cannot be solved without China. U.S. goals to strengthen global health security absolutely require Chinese cooperation in early disease detection, transparent data sharing, and contribution to response efforts. In the past, China’s cooperation was crucial in containing SARS and Ebola (where it sent health workers to West Africa). For climate, U.S. regional and global aims (e.g., reducing emissions, helping Pacific islands cope with rising seas) need China to transition off coal and help fund green development. Encouragingly, China has invested heavily in renewables; the U.S. wants it to continue this and to possibly co-lead regional initiatives like a Green Belt and Road or funding climate resilience in Southeast Asia.

* **Promoting a Rules-Based Order:** The U.S. isn’t asking China to embrace Western democracy, but it does want China to respect international law and norms. If China uses its clout to *reinforce* rules – say, by mediating disputes fairly, participating in UN peacekeeping (where it already contributes the most peacekeepers of any P5 member), and supporting reform of institutions like the IMF to give emerging economies more voice – it strengthens the order that underpins U.S. security and prosperity. China did help in anti-piracy operations and has been a stabilizer in some UN votes. The U.S. wants more of that: e.g., China could help enforce the rule of law in maritime disputes by aligning with the UNCLOS tribunal outcomes (even if it had reservations).

In sum, **China can help the U.S. by being a responsible power** – one that pursues its interests through dialogue and mutual agreement rather than coercion or revisionism. Past contributions like **joint climate pledges** and **counter-piracy patrols** show China can work alongside the U.S. ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Flees%20to%20U,Hong%20Kong%20Protesters%202020%3A%20%E2%80%98Phase)). The U.S. hopes that in the future, China will play a positive role in issues like reconstructing war-torn states (imagine U.S.-China joint efforts in post-conflict Syria or a peacekeeping mission in Myanmar if it evolves), which align with U.S. goals of regional stability and development.

*Past and present contributions:* Historically, China’s cooperation in isolating North Korea after its nuclear tests (e.g., supporting UN sanctions in 2017\) contributed to U.S. security aims ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=Looms%202021%3A%20U,S)). Chinese naval escorts protected commerce from Somalia pirates, indirectly securing sea lanes vital to U.S. trade. China’s economic rise also lifted Asia-Pacific economies, creating markets for U.S. goods and helping regional stability through prosperity. These are positive contributions to build on.

*What we would like in the future:* Looking ahead, the U.S. would like China to continue and expand such contributions: commit to peaceful dispute resolution (especially with Taiwan – maintaining dialogue across the Strait), join or at least not impede U.S.-led initiatives (like if the U.S. revives a multilateral trade pact, China meeting its standards to possibly join), increase transparency in military affairs (so neighbors feel less threatened). Additionally, China could leverage its influence with Russia to promote peace in Ukraine – that would greatly aid global stability, an expressed U.S. goal. If Beijing were to firmly oppose any use of nuclear weapons by Russia ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=presidency,Biden)), that would be a powerful deterrent. Essentially, **a cooperative China helps the U.S. achieve a stable, prosperous, and secure world – which benefits all**.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

China’s needs from the U.S. and the international community tie directly into its national priorities of economic development, social stability, and global stature:

* **Economic Growth and Technological Advancement:** China needs access to external markets, capital, and technology to sustain its economy. The U.S. market remains one of the largest for Chinese exports; continued U.S. consumer demand (and avoiding decoupling) is in China’s interest. China also seeks U.S./Western **technology and expertise**, whether through trade or investment. For example, China still relies on certain high-end semiconductors from U.S.-allied sources; it needs the U.S. not to completely shut off this pipeline as it works on self-reliance. Additionally, China’s companies benefit from being able to raise funds in global financial centers like New York or Hong Kong (where international norms matter). Thus, China needs a relatively open global trading system and financial system. Moves like U.S. export controls or investment screening alarm Beijing – they need some relaxation or clear rules of the road to plan their development. China also could use international support in upgrading its industries – partnering with Western firms or participating in global R\&D collaborations. In short, to move up the value chain and avoid the middle income trap, China **needs collaboration, not isolation** from advanced economies.

* **Domestic Modernization Support:** As China tackles internal challenges (like improving healthcare, reforming its financial sector, transitioning to a green economy), it benefits from foreign input. U.S. companies can provide high-quality goods and services to meet Chinese consumers’ aspirations (e.g., medical devices, higher education). Joint ventures in healthcare, agriculture, and services can help China improve standards of living. International cooperation on food safety, urban planning, and transportation (like learning from global best practices) aligns with Chinese needs. The world can also contribute to China’s western regions development – for instance, foreign investment in Central and Western provinces can reduce regional inequalities, a Chinese government goal. The U.S. could ease restrictions on development finance or encourage its firms to responsibly invest in less-developed parts of China, if political conditions improved, which would address some Chinese needs for balanced growth.

* **Energy and Environmental Needs:** China’s booming economy thirsts for energy. It needs the global community to maintain stable energy supplies and also to help it diversify. The U.S. can supply LNG and oil (contributing to China’s energy security) and work in fora like the G20 to prevent oil price shocks. Also, as China tries to reduce coal use, it could use foreign assistance in expanding nuclear and renewable energy. Access to rare clean-tech inputs (like lithium for EV batteries) is another need – cooperation rather than competition for resources will help China avoid bottlenecks. On environment, China needs global partnerships to fight pollution that doesn’t respect borders – e.g., regional efforts to reduce transboundary air pollution or to protect the oceans (China’s fishing fleet has caused tensions; working out fishery management deals with others would help it sustain its protein supply and image).

* **Stable International Environment and Peace:** To focus on its development, China needs a peaceful international environment. It suffered in the past from wars and sanctions. Thus, China needs the U.S. not to foment conflict on its periphery or target China militarily. Specifically, China needs assurance that the U.S. and allies won’t support separatism in Taiwan or Xinjiang/Tibet – essentially respect for its sovereignty claims. While the U.S. cannot fully accede to that from its perspective, a stable understanding (One China policy continuation, no official Taiwan independence moves) is something China seeks. Globally, China benefits from anti-proliferation (it doesn’t want neighbors like Japan or South Korea to go nuclear, which they might if they lost faith in U.S. extended deterrence – ironically, robust U.S. alliances actually serve Chinese interests by preventing an Asian arms race). So China needs the U.S. to manage its alliances prudently and avoid an arms build-up that forces China to divert huge resources to defense at the expense of economy.

* **Respect and Equality on the World Stage:** Part of China’s “needs” is more abstract but deeply felt – the need for international respect and recognition as a major power. After historical humiliations by foreign powers, the Chinese public and elites crave equal treatment. This means China doesn’t want to be dictated to or treated as a junior partner; it wants its voice heard in setting global agendas. Practical manifestations: a greater role in IMF/World Bank decision-making (the U.S. has begun to accommodate this by modest quota increases), inclusion in global governance bodies (like maybe joining the G7 in some expanded form down the line). It also needs the U.S. to acknowledge some of its ideas – for example, taking China’s Global Security Initiative or Global Development Initiative seriously and finding common ground rather than dismissing them as propaganda. At the bilateral level, China needs the U.S. to show respect in dialogue – high-level visits, avoiding public humiliation or lecturing, and framing cooperation as between equals. This psychological aspect, if addressed, can make China more amenable to cooperation.

* **Support for Domestic Stability (indirectly):** While China will never invite direct foreign involvement in its internal affairs, indirectly it needs a calm domestic environment free from external agitation. That means it would prefer the U.S. not impose sanctions on its officials or stir up issues like human rights in a way that galvanizes internal dissent. It also needs external validation of its achievements to legitimize the regime at home (e.g., recognition of its poverty alleviation success, which the UN did praise). If the world engages positively, it strengthens the argument within China that integration works better than isolation or ultra-nationalism.

Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges include: **public health** (collaboration on disease research benefits China’s aging population health needs), **food security** (U.S. agricultural exports and tech help China feed its people and improve food safety), **anti-corruption and governance** (ironically, China joining global standards like FATF anti-money laundering helps its crackdown on illicit money flows abroad, aligning with Xi’s anti-graft campaign). Also, **education**: many Chinese students are educated in the West; continued openness there helps China build human capital.

In summary, China needs a **stable, open international system** to continue thriving – one where it is not isolated or contained, where trade and technology flow relatively freely (with rules), and where it has a seat at the table to shape norms. It also needs specific cooperation to manage transnational problems that could derail its development (climate, pandemics, terrorism). Meeting these needs through U.S. engagement and global frameworks will not only benefit China but also contribute to global stability and, ultimately, align with U.S. interests in a peaceful, prosperous world.

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

To advance U.S. interests while addressing mutual needs, this proposal outlines a comprehensive plan called **“Competitive Collaboration”** – acknowledging competition but seeking structured cooperation with China on shared goals. The plan has several prongs:

1. **Strategic Deterrence and Dialogue:** The U.S. will maintain a strong military posture in the Indo-Pacific (investing in alliances, new technologies, and force presence) to deter aggression, **while simultaneously launching new bilateral strategic dialogues**. Specifically, propose a U.S.-China **“Crisis Management Hotline and Regular Military Dialogue”**: re-establish communication links between the Pentagon and PLA at senior levels and agree on protocols to prevent incidents at sea/air. In parallel, initiate **talks on nuclear risk reduction**, inviting China to observer status in future U.S.-Russia arms control discussions and eventually to trilateral transparency measures (even if not formal treaties initially). This two-track approach – firm deterrence coupled with active risk-reduction talks – aims to prevent conflict through miscalculation.

2. **Economic Re-engagement with Fairness:** The U.S. should propose a sequenced **trade normalization plan** where certain tariffs on consumer goods are lifted to reduce inflation (a U.S. interest) in exchange for China eliminating specific barriers (e.g., lifting its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm goods and ensuring better IP enforcement measured by reductions in piracy rates). Concurrently, start negotiations on a **Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)** framework focusing on market access and investment protections, incorporating commitments on not forcing tech transfers. To address tech competition, create a **U.S.-China Tech Working Group** under strict guidelines: identify non-sensitive areas (like climate tech, medical research) for collaboration, while agreeing on basic norms (no cyber theft of intellectual property, etc.). As part of this, the U.S. can offer to relax certain export controls (e.g., on older-generation chips) if China agrees to **transparent subsidies** practices and refrains from providing military tech to Russia. This conditional engagement approach uses leverage from U.S. restrictions to gain concessions, then gradually rebuilds a more open trading relationship that benefits both.

3. **Joint Global Initiatives:** Launch a set of high-profile cooperative initiatives that show the world the U.S. and China can work together. For example, propose a **“U.S.-China Climate Action Partnership”** – reinstate and elevate the climate dialogue by setting up joint projects: a large-scale carbon capture pilot in China’s coal power sector funded by both, a U.S.-China fund for clean energy investment in developing countries (each putting in a few billion, inviting others to join) ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Global%20environmental%20problems%20cannot%20be,economy%20is%20also%20an%20important)), and a bilateral pledge to phase down methane by a set percentage by 2030\. Another initiative: a **Global Health Security Cooperation** – invite China to co-lead reforming early pandemic warning systems at WHO, and resume NIH-CDC collaboration with Chinese counterparts on infectious disease research (with safeguards to address lab safety concerns). Also, establish a **Trilateral development forum** (U.S.-China-World Bank) to coordinate on infrastructure financing standards, effectively aligning parts of BRI with G7’s infrastructure initiative so projects aren’t at cross purposes.

4. **Humanitarian and People-to-People Reconnection:** As a goodwill measure, the U.S. should **ease visa processing** for Chinese students and researchers in non-sensitive fields, and encourage China to reciprocate for American scholars and journalists (press for reopening a U.S. consulate in Chengdu which was closed in tit-for-tat). Re-launch the Fulbright and Peace Corps programs in China to rebuild educational bridges. On human rights, continue frank private diplomacy but also seek **incremental progress**: propose that China allow a U.N. visit to Xinjiang with conditions, in exchange for U.S. consideration of dialing back some sanctions. Push for the release of a few high-profile political prisoners as a confidence-building gesture – perhaps in return, the U.S. could invite Chinese law enforcement to observer status in some international anti-trafficking operations (something China wants cooperation on). Small steps, but symbolically important. Humanitarian cooperation can also include working jointly on refugee crises in other countries (e.g., both contributing to Rohingya refugee relief in Bangladesh), showcasing that despite differences, they can do good together.

5. **Leverage Multilateral Institutions:** Use platforms like the East Asia Summit and G20 to institutionalize U.S.-China cooperation. For instance, propose at the EAS a **maritime Southeast Asia peace initiative** co-chaired by the U.S. and China, focusing on Coast Guard cooperation and fisheries management to reduce South China Sea tensions. At the G20, form a **U.S.-China co-chaired committee on global debt relief** (since many debtor countries owe China and Western lenders) to coordinate restructuring – this addresses developing world needs and prevents financial crises (serving global stability, which both need). Such institutional cooperation not only tackles issues but binds the U.S. and China into productive engagement.

This comprehensive approach aims to **“de-risk” the competition by building guardrails and joint wins**. It sets clear expectations: the U.S. will compete vigorously (militarily and economically) but is offering pathways for China to cooperate where interests align, and to be integrated as a responsible leader internationally. If China reciprocates, tensions could ease; if not, U.S. allies and partners will see that Washington made good-faith efforts, strengthening the U.S. case for collective resolve.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

* **Establish Stable Great-Power Communication:** Create regular high-level summits (at least annual) and empower a special envoy office for U.S.-China relations. The goal is to manage adversarial elements through dialogue – e.g., a dedicated diplomatic channel on Taiwan to avoid misread “red lines.” In these talks, promote **mutual understanding of intentions**: assure China that the U.S. does not seek to contain its rise if it abides by rules, and hear China’s core concerns to seek non-military solutions. Strengthening alliances remains key – the U.S. will reassure allies like Japan, Australia, and NATO of its commitments (this deters conflict), but simultaneously use those strong alliances as leverage to bring China to negotiating tables (since China prefers not to face a united coalition). Essentially, manage adversarial relations by showing firmness with allies while keeping an open door for diplomacy with Beijing.

* **Promote Universal Values Consistently but Creatively:** Rather than blunt public berating, the U.S. will integrate human rights into a broader narrative of global good governance which China can’t easily dismiss. For example, tie anti-corruption (a stated Chinese priority) to rule of law improvements, and offer technical help (via UNODC or OECD frameworks) to China to strengthen transparency – indirectly promoting aspects of good governance. Continue to speak out on issues like Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet in multinational settings (UN joint statements ([UN Member Countries Condemn China's Crimes Against Humanity](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/23/un-member-countries-condemn-chinas-crimes-against-humanity#:~:text=UN%20Member%20Countries%20Condemn%20China%27s,against%20humanity%20committed%20against%20Uyghurs))) to show it’s not just U.S.-vs-China but world concern. Meanwhile, fund and support civil society exchanges – like academic conferences on labor rights or disability rights including Chinese participants – to gently advocate democratic values. The objective is to nudge China toward better practices and signal to its people that the U.S. stands for these universal rights. Over time, even small pressure can lead to improvements (as seen in China reducing some air pollution after public outcry and international highlighting, hinting that sustained focus yields change). In diplomacy, maintain principled stances but leave room for face-saving compromises (e.g., don’t demand public apologies for Tiananmen, which won’t happen, but quietly push for China to open archives or allow commemoration by families – incremental justice).

* **Prevent Isolation, Encourage Multilateralism:** Another objective is to keep China engaged in the international system rather than let it form a parallel order with Russia or others. Thus, diplomatically, the U.S. will avoid actions that completely cut off China (no to kicking China out of UN agencies, etc., as that backfired historically with others). Instead, work within groups like the WTO to address grievances – update trade rules so that China can either comply or face legitimate multilateral consequences. By managing the rivalry within institutions, the U.S. upholds the system and gives China incentives to follow rules (since it helped create them). Diplomatically, the U.S. can also leverage China’s desire for respect: consider inviting China to observer status in certain allied discussions on global issues (for ex: have China in a climate discussion alongside NATO or in an expanded G7 climate forum) as long as it’s constructive. This inclusive approach, coupled with clear boundaries, will strengthen alliances (they see U.S. leadership not knee-jerk confrontation but strategic), and hopefully temper Chinese behavior through positive reinforcement.

**Economic Strategies:**

* **Selective Decoupling with Targeted Coupling:** The U.S. will protect key industries (like semiconductors, defense tech) by restricting Chinese access where national security demands (export controls, investment blocks), **while expanding mutually beneficial trade in non-security sectors**. For example, encourage U.S. exports of LNG, agriculture, and services to China (which helps reduce the trade deficit and benefits U.S. farmers and companies) ([China Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#:~:text=Since%20China%20began%20to%20open,services%20over%20the%20same%20period)). Negotiate removal of Chinese tariffs on those goods in exchange for something it wants (e.g., removal of U.S. tariffs on certain consumer electronics). This way both economies remain interlinked where it’s win-win, but insulated where it’s win-lose. Also, diversify supply chains collaboratively: rather than simply cutting China out, work with allies and even Chinese partners to ensure multiple sources for critical goods (for instance, have some medical supply production in U.S./Mexico for resilience, but also keep some in China to not shock the system).

* **Innovation and Tech Cooperation:** Domestically, the U.S. will invest massively in R\&D (as with the CHIPS and Science Act) to keep its tech edge. Internationally, propose **techno-diplomacy**: identify global tech problems both want to solve (like climate tech, or AI safety) and initiate projects with Chinese researchers under international frameworks. A specific idea: a **U.S.-China AI code of conduct** developed with input from tech companies, to set norms on AI use (no AI in nuclear launch decisions, etc.). Economically, that stabilizes the tech race and could prevent an unchecked AI arms race. Additionally, push for an updated WTO agreement on **digital trade and e-commerce** that includes data protections, which could pave the way for U.S. tech firms to re-enter China under clear rules and Chinese digital firms to operate under transparent guidelines abroad – expanding commerce while safeguarding rights.

* **Sustainable Development and Debt:** Encourage China to join in debt relief efforts for developing nations (some heavily indebted to China). The U.S. Treasury can work with China’s Finance Ministry in the G20’s Common Framework to restructure debts of countries like Zambia or Sri Lanka, ensuring those nations remain stable markets and don’t cause financial contagion ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)). Simultaneously, coordinate with allies to offer alternatives to BRI so China may be more willing to co-finance rather than solely finance, sharing risks. This can prevent a zero-sum scramble for influence and instead create **partnerships in development** – e.g., a joint U.S.-China project to build solar farms in Africa or ports in Southeast Asia under agreed standards.

* **Encourage Chinese Investment in the U.S. that Creates Jobs:** While scrutinizing sensitive sectors, allow and even solicit Chinese foreign direct investment in non-sensitive areas like manufacturing of consumer goods or greenfield projects that create American jobs. For instance, if a Chinese automaker wants to build an EV factory in the U.S. employing Americans, that could be welcomed with proper security review. This ties China into U.S. economic success and gives it stake in good relations (similar to how Japanese and European companies employ many Americans). As part of this strategy, protect against predatory investments but differentiate benign ones – streamline approval for those.

* **Economic Alliance Coordination:** Work closely with the EU, Japan, and others to ensure a united front on demanding China abide by trade rules (so China can’t play off countries against each other). Use this leverage to negotiate with China in multilateral settings – e.g., update the WTO rules on subsidies and state enterprises with China at the table, so that it feels ownership of new rules instead of seeing them as anti-China. That could lock in some **market reforms** within China beneficial to U.S. companies (like fairer competition in public procurement). Encouraging China to join high-standard trade agreements (like CPTPP if it meets conditions) can also push it toward reforms while binding it to rules; the U.S. might not join CPTPP immediately but could use the prospect as incentive for China to raise its standards.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**  
 China’s public health capacity has seen improvements but also glaring issues (e.g., initial COVID cover-up). The U.S. can take a cooperative yet firm approach:

* **Assessment:** China built an impressive public health infrastructure in some ways (disease surveillance, massive testing ability as seen in COVID, and an increasing biotech sector). However, weaknesses include lower efficacy of domestic vaccines, reluctance to import foreign mRNA vaccines due to national pride, and insufficient transparency with international health bodies. The bureaucracy sometimes prioritizes political considerations over prompt health reporting. Also, traditional medicine is popular and integrated in health policy, which sometimes clashes with Western medical consensus.

* **Opportunities:** The U.S. should propose rebuilding direct ties between health agencies. For instance, re-open a U.S. CDC office in Beijing (it was closed during the COVID fallout) to facilitate communication. Conduct **joint pandemic simulations** with Chinese health officials under WHO auspices – practicing responses to hypothetical outbreaks can improve trust and data sharing. Another area is **vaccine collaboration**: invite China to join in clinical trials for next-gen vaccines (for HIV, TB, etc.) and share data. Encourage China to deploy its significant pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity for global good (like co-producing vaccines for developing nations, managed jointly for quality assurance).

What the U.S. wants from China on this topic is straightforward: timely sharing of outbreak information, viral samples, and research data; cooperation in investigating disease origins scientifically (even if politically sensitive, at least not obstructing WHO); and alignment on standards for health security (like no excessive travel restrictions without evidence – something both accused each other of during COVID). The U.S. also wants China’s help in global health initiatives – e.g., both being top funders of COVAX for vaccine distribution.

How to get cooperation? By appealing to mutual benefit: next virus could emerge anywhere (even U.S.), so both have a stake in a system where transparency is rewarded, not punished. Perhaps negotiate a **reciprocal agreement**: U.S. will also commit to rapid info sharing and not politicizing health emergencies if China does the same. Use international pressure subtly – have many countries together push for China’s openness (so it’s not one-on-one). Another lever is offering technical aid: if a new flu strain appears in China, the U.S. can offer its advanced labs to sequence and develop targeted vaccines with China, giving China incentive to report it.

Additionally, publicize success stories of past U.S.-China health collaboration (like how U.S. and Chinese scientists worked together on influenza strains for vaccines) to rebuild trust.

Emphasize that health security is collective security: an outbreak unchecked in China nearly shut down the world; preventing that aligns with CCP’s interest in domestic stability too. If needed, tie cooperation to economic reopening – e.g., say the U.S. will consider lifting remaining travel restrictions or trade irritants if China robustly cooperates on global health.

Finally, maintain U.S. readiness by investing in its own pandemic response (so it can assist others) – showing leadership that encourages China to not be left out of a global cooperative framework.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**  
 For China, “migration” issues are not as extensive as in regions like the Middle East, but there are notable points:

* **Refugees in China:** China hosts relatively few refugees officially; however, it has an ongoing situation with **North Korean refugees** who flee across the border. China currently considers them illegal economic migrants and often repatriates them, which the U.S. and UN condemn because repatriated North Koreans face severe punishment. The U.S. would like China to adopt a more humane policy – at minimum not returning escapees and ideally working with UNHCR to care for them or allow safe passage to South Korea. How to get them to cooperate? Emphasize regional stability and international image – China doesn’t want to be seen as complicit in human rights abuses. Perhaps quiet diplomacy offering to help: for instance, the U.S. and allies could agree to resettle a quota of North Korean refugees if China allows UNHCR access. China may harbour concerns that leniency could encourage a flood; addressing that by controlled third-country resettlement could be a solution the U.S. brokers.

* **Chinese asylum seekers abroad:** As noted, more Chinese citizens are seeking refuge due to persecution or disillusionment. The U.S. should uphold its values by granting asylum case-by-case to those with credible claims (e.g., Uyghurs, Hong Kong democracy activists). Communicate to Beijing that this is a legal process, not a hostile act, and ensure those who are admitted aren’t used by either side politically. If numbers increase, the U.S. might coordinate with allies to share the responsibility (some go to Canada, etc.). The U.S. could also consider creating a special humanitarian program for, say, Hong Kongers, which it already did to some extent (deferred enforced departure). While China won’t like any acceptance of their dissidents, framing it as a humanitarian, not political, gesture might mitigate backlash.

* **Border management cooperation:** The U.S. and China can work together on *transnational crime* at borders – particularly drug smuggling. As mentioned, fentanyl precursor chemicals often originate in China and end up in Mexican cartels’ hands, fueling the U.S. opioid crisis. After recent diplomacy, China agreed to curb these chemicals ([Timeline: U.S.-China Relations](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-china-relations#:~:text=The%20two%20leaders%20meet%20in,ties%20between%20the%20two%20countries%E2%80%94ultimately)). The U.S. should follow up with technical cooperation: e.g., have DEA liaise with China’s narcotics bureau to track shipments, share intelligence on trafficking networks, and train customs officials in detection. This is a concrete border management issue where both see an interest (the U.S. wants to stop fentanyl, China publicly doesn’t want to be blamed as source). Another area: **human trafficking** – Chinese nationals are sometimes smuggled abroad, and Southeast Asia sees trafficking that can involve Chinese gangs; the U.S. and China could share info to bust rings (they actually cooperated in the early 2000s on some smuggling cases).

China does not harbor large refugee populations (like Jordan or Turkey do), except North Koreans. But it is involved in refugee-producing situations indirectly (Myanmar’s conflict sends some refugees to China’s Yunnan province too). The U.S. could coordinate humanitarian aid for those on Chinese soil, showing goodwill.

If conflict or disaster hit in Asia (say a collapse in North Korea or a mass evacuation from Taiwan in a crisis scenario), U.S.-China communication on refugee flows would be critical. Setting up a basic framework now (like information sharing channels in case of mass movements) would be prudent.

**What do we want and how to cooperate:** Summarizing, the U.S. wants China to treat refugees humanely, stop illicit flows (drugs, traffickers), and not use migration as a weapon (which China hasn’t really done, but making sure it stays that way). To get cooperation: use a mix of incentives (help with resettlement and aid so China isn’t left with burden) and pressure (pointing out international legal obligations) quietly. In drug control, show tangible benefits of cooperation (reduced overdose deaths which could be publicized positively) to encourage sustained effort. Overall, framing migration and refugees as *humanitarian* rather than *political* will help engage China, which prefers to keep these low-profile.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**  
 Corruption is an area where China publicly is engaged in an internal war on graft. There is convergence with U.S. interest in rule of law, though methods differ. The U.S. can seize this common ground:

* **Assess levels of corruption:** China has had endemic corruption due to rapid growth and weak rule of law – officials often took bribes for permits, etc. Xi’s campaign has punished many (“tigers and flies”), but corruption persists in evolved forms (hidden financial deals, misallocation in state enterprises). Judicial independence is low – anti-graft drives are handled by party discipline bodies not courts, so due process is lacking. Transparency is limited; China ranks poorly on global indices (like 66th of 180 on Transparency International’s CPI).

* **Strengthen rule of law and transparency:** The U.S. can encourage China to adopt more institutional anti-corruption measures: e.g., stronger protections for whistleblowers, publishing government budgets fully, empowering investigative journalism. While directly telling China to free its press may not work, linking anti-corruption success to public supervision could appeal to party reformers.

Proposed measures and cooperation:

* **Asset Recovery Cooperation:** Corrupt Chinese officials often launder money or flee to Western countries (so-called fox-hunting by China to retrieve fugitives). The U.S. and China signed an anti-corruption agreement under G20 principles; we can deepen that by jointly tracing ill-gotten assets. The U.S. can agree to repatriate stolen funds to China *if* China ensures fair legal processes for those suspects (no torture, maybe allow U.S. observers in trials). This way, China sees the U.S. helping its anti-corruption, and in return, Chinese legal proceedings become more standardized.  
* **Capacity Building:** Offer training for Chinese auditors and regulators on detecting complex financial crimes, maybe through multilateral bodies (like APEC anti-corruption workshops). Also, invite China to join the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention (which requires criminalizing bribery of foreign officials) – that could be a constructive step if they commit.  
* **Encourage Civil Society Oversight:** Quietly support exchanges between Chinese anti-corruption scholars and international NGOs (like Transparency Int’l) to seed ideas about open government. The U.S. can highlight how a robust legal system and independent courts help keep corruption at bay (without directly saying “be like us,” show evidence from other Asian states that reformed).

For building a more robust partnership, emphasize that reducing corruption in China will make it a more reliable partner for U.S. businesses and government deals – no one wants their investments lost to graft. And for China, frame it as bolstering domestic stability and legitimacy.

The U.S. will continue using tools like the Global Magnitsky sanctions to target Chinese officials involved in egregious corruption or rights abuses, but it can communicate that those are specific, rule-based actions, not arbitrary – even possibly give China heads-up through diplomatic channels to show transparency in our own process. If China sees it as rule-of-law action and not political punishment, there’s slim but some chance it might respond in kind by cleaning up those individuals domestically.

Finally, propose China join initiatives such as the **Open Government Partnership** (unlikely in near term given secrecy, but planting the seed). Or simpler: share technology and practices for transparency – e.g., help them implement e-procurement systems to reduce bribes in contracting.

By making anti-corruption a cooperative theme, we subtly promote rule of law and good governance, which in the long run aligns with democratic principles.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**  
 This analysis covered some aspects under diplomatic influence, but concretely:

* **Support China’s constructive role in the UN and regional orgs:** Encourage China to use its UN Security Council veto responsibly – e.g., not vetoing humanitarian aid deliveries (like in Syria). A U.S. approach could be consulting China early on draft resolutions to incorporate any reasonable concerns, so China feels its input is respected and thus is less likely to veto. On peacekeeping, continue to welcome China’s troop contributions and maybe do joint trainings for peacekeepers (improving interoperability and trust).

* **ASEAN and Asia-Pacific:** Urge China to conclude a meaningful **Code of Conduct with ASEAN** on the South China Sea. The U.S. can offer to endorse such a code if it’s consistent with international law, giving China incentive to finalize it for international approval. In forums like APEC, work with China on economic recovery initiatives, avoiding protectionist rhetoric. Possibly revive the idea of a **Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP)** as a long-term vision, which includes both U.S. and China – a carrot for cooperation.

* **Global Governance Reforms:** Where China seeks changes (e.g., more quota in IMF, or promoting its Belt and Road as part of global infrastructure plan), the U.S. should engage and shape those reforms rather than block. If China sees the U.S. will fairly consider its proposals in institutions, it will be less inclined to form parallel institutions. Also, when China leads an institution (e.g., heads of FAO, ITU recently), the U.S. should hold them accountable to international standards but not automatically oppose Chinese candidates – support them if qualified and encourage them to act impartially, which increases China’s incentive to abide by norms.

* **Leverage G20 and G7**: The U.S. in G7 can coordinate policy toward China (like G7 statements on maritime law) to present unified positions; in G20 including China, find consensus language showing overlap (like all G20 including China committing to climate action, etc.). This dual-track aligns allies and then integrates China, ensuring multilateral weight backs key U.S. positions but also giving China credit when it joins consensus.

* **Conflict resolution:** If there’s an opportunity, involve China in resolving regional conflicts diplomatically: e.g., maybe a contact group for Myanmar that includes China, ASEAN, and the West to facilitate dialogue between the junta and opposition. Using China’s influence positively there would help end a crisis. The U.S. can propose such inclusive formats.

Essentially, **bind China to multilateral solutions** by giving it a stake and status in them – co-chairing committees, hosting conferences, etc. At the same time, when China undermines institutions (like using Interpol to pursue dissidents), rally partners to push back and set rules (the recent election of an Interpol head from China was controversial; ensuring Interpol has safeguards was key – that sort of coalition action is needed whenever China might bend rules).

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**  
 Apart from government structure, there are broader societal human rights issues where the U.S. can push for progress and link them to bilateral engagement:

* **Labor Rights:** The U.S. should continue enforcing the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, barring imports made with forced labor in Xinjiang ([Freedom House Freedom in the World 2024 Report Finds China is Pursuing an Aggressive Policy of Altering the Demographics in East Turkistan, Southern Mongolia and Tibet \- AFI](https://asiafreedominstitute.org/news/freedom-house-freedom-in-the-world-2024-report-finds-china-is-pursuing-an-aggressive-policy-of-altering-the-demographics-in-east-turkistan-southern-mongolia-and-tibet/#:~:text=On%20the%20question%20of%20whether,%E2%80%9D)). To go beyond punitive, offer China help in adopting modern labor standards: e.g., technical advice on factory inspections or invite China to observer status in the International Labor Organization’s better work program. If China improves labor conditions (like letting the ILO monitor in Xinjiang), U.S. could in return adjust import restrictions. American companies too can be enlisted to pressure supply chain compliance in China (a market-driven nudge on labor rights).

* **Indigenous and Minority Rights:** For Uyghurs, Tibetans, Mongolians – encourage cultural protections. Possibly support cultural exchanges: invite minority artists or scholars to the U.S., raising their profile positively. The U.S. could quietly negotiate for easier access for these minorities to foreign observers or their diaspora. Social justice also includes **hukou reform** (China’s internal migrant workers face inequality) – while internal, the U.S. can fund and share research on how addressing such inequality leads to stability, which might prod Chinese policymakers to act.

* **Gender Equality:** China has relatively high female labor participation but low political representation. U.S. can promote women’s empowerment by supporting programs in China (through NGOs or universities) on entrepreneurship for women, health initiatives (maternal health, which China has done well, so perhaps less need). Emphasize how gender equality benefits economic growth – an angle China’s pragmatic leaders might accept.

* **LGBTQ and other social issues:** The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has been active in outreach (like Pride events), which is symbolic. Continue that, even if Chinese authorities disapprove, as it shows American values. Over time, societal attitudes can shift – e.g., more Chinese youth are aware of LGBTQ rights globally. Keeping those dialogues alive through cultural channels (even films, books) is part of long game human rights.

Diplomatically, fold these issues into broader human rights discussions – not just focusing on political prisoners, but also urging ratification of treaties (China has signed but not ratified the ICCPR – International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; keep encouraging that). Also highlight positive examples: praise China when it does well (like poverty alleviation as a social justice win, or increase in rural healthcare access), then contrast areas for improvement – carrot and stick in narrative.

**Influence on diplomatic ties and stability:** Better human rights practices in China would remove a major irritant in bilateral relations, garner goodwill in the U.S. public, and likely lead to a more stable China (less repression means fewer flashpoints like Hong Kong protests). So the U.S. strategy is to patiently push these issues in every appropriate forum (from UN Human Rights Council to bilateral human rights dialogues) and link progress to improved bilateral atmospherics (e.g., imply that a more open China would be met with more cultural and scientific cooperation, etc.).

To conclude this document, both the United States and China have much to gain from a relationship that carefully balances competition with collaboration. The U.S. will stand firm in defending its interests and values – working with allies to deter aggression and protect human rights – **while also recognizing areas where engagement with China can advance mutual goals** such as peace, prosperity, and planetary health. By implementing the strategies detailed above, the U.S. aims to guide this pivotal relationship toward a stable equilibrium: one in which competition does not spiral into conflict, and cooperation is pursued wherever possible for the benefit of both nations and the world.

**Tariff Report:** Currently, U.S. tariffs remain imposed on approximately $335 billion worth of Chinese imports, covering about two-thirds of goods from China at an average rate of 19.3% ([US-China Trade War Tariffs: An Up-to-Date Chart | PIIE](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart#:~:text=US,trade%20war%20began%20in%202018)). These tariffs, initiated during the 2018–2019 trade war, hit categories like electronics, machinery, and furniture with duties ranging mostly from 7.5% up to 25%. China retaliated with tariffs on about $110 billion of U.S. goods (mostly agriculture, automobiles, and energy products), with rates around 5% to 25%. As of 2024, the U.S. has maintained Section 301 tariffs due to ongoing concerns over China’s trade practices; China has kept most of its counter-tariffs but issued exemptions to mitigate impact on its industries (for example, it waived some tariffs to resume buying U.S. soybeans and LNG). Both sides’ tariffs have distorted trade: Chinese exports to the U.S. declined in categories under high tariffs, while U.S. exports of affected goods like soybeans initially plunged (though China made up with buying commitments under the Phase One deal). Notably, despite tariffs, the bilateral trade volume in goods in 2022 rebounded to a record $690 billion, indicating enduring demand ([\[PDF\] U.S. Trade with China 2022 \- Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file#:~:text=,of%20%28%2429.4%20billion%29)). U.S. consumers bear higher costs for import-reliant products, and U.S. farmers and firms faced lost sales until partial trade deal purchases helped. Going forward, the U.S. Trade Representative is reviewing tariffs for effectiveness. The Biden Administration has thus far left most tariffs in place as leverage, but has instituted a tariff exclusion process for U.S. companies to request relief on certain imports not available elsewhere. Any future adjustment to tariffs will likely depend on China’s adherence to trade commitments and progress in broader negotiations. In summary, **U.S. tariffs on China—averaging roughly 19% vs 3% pre-trade war—remain historically high ([US-China Trade War Tariffs: An Up-to-Date Chart | PIIE](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart#:~:text=US,trade%20war%20began%20in%202018)), and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods—covering about 58% of exports—also remain elevated, a situation both sides might ease if a more comprehensive trade understanding is reached.**

**Immigration to USA Report:** Chinese immigration to the United States has been a significant contributor to American demographic and economic life. As of 2021, about **2.38 million Chinese-born immigrants** reside in the U.S. ([Chinese Immigrants in the United States \- Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/chinese-immigrants-united-states-2021#:~:text=Institute%20www,a%20long%20period%20of)), making China the third-largest source of the foreign-born U.S. population (after Mexico and India). Including U.S.-born descendants, the Chinese American community numbers approximately **5.4 million (about 1.6% of the U.S. population) ([Chinese Americans: A Survey Data Snapshot | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/08/06/chinese-americans-a-survey-data-snapshot/#:~:text=About%204,nation%E2%80%99s%20total%20Asian%20American%20population))**, concentrated in states like California, New York, and Texas. Chinese immigrants have high rates of educational attainment and employment in STEM fields, often entering through skilled work visas or as students transitioning to work. In recent years, about 80,000–100,000 Chinese international students per year have obtained visas to study in U.S. colleges, many of whom later pursue employment or residency. The U.S. has also seen an uptick in asylum applications from Chinese nationals, including political dissidents, persecuted religious minorities (like Christians and Falun Gong practitioners), Uyghurs fleeing repression, and recently Hong Kong pro-democracy activists. For example, following the 2019 Hong Kong protests and 2020 National Security Law, the U.S. offered **Temporary Protected Status (TPS)** to Hong Kong residents and has accepted thousands of Hong Kong refugees. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in PRC nationals arriving at the southern U.S. border seeking asylum – U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported encounters with about **24,000 Chinese migrants in the first half of FY2023**, surpassing prior years ([2024 Chinese Migrants To US Is Nothing New – But The Reasons For Recent Surge At Southern Border Are](https://umbc.edu/stories/chinese-migrants-to-us/#:~:text=remarkable%20in%20these%20figures%20is,year%20earlier%20in%20December%202022)). This reflects growing migration fueled by China’s domestic political climate and economic uncertainties. The U.S. immigration system has caps that limit Chinese migration in certain categories (for instance, the family-sponsored visa backlog for China is long, and the Diversity Visa lottery is not open to mainland Chinese). Nonetheless, Chinese immigrants continue to arrive through family reunification, employment visas (particularly the H-1B and EB-5 investor visa programs), and as refugees or parolees in special cases. The Chinese American community has contributed greatly in fields like academia, medicine, engineering, and business. Looking ahead, U.S. immigration policy is trying to balance attracting talent from China (e.g., researchers, tech experts) with national security screening – recent stricter vetting aims to prevent espionage or IP theft, which led to some visa denials for individuals with PLA-affiliated backgrounds. Overall, Chinese immigration remains a vital stream – albeit now scrutinized – and the U.S. is home to the largest diaspora of Chinese outside Asia. Both governments have an interest in facilitating lawful, **people-to-people exchange**, even as geopolitical tensions continue.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens to Visit:** U.S. citizens are **required to obtain a visa** prior to traveling to mainland China ([China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html#:~:text=Entry%20%26%20Exit%3A)). Tourist and business visas (category L for tourism, M for commerce) must be applied for at a Chinese embassy or consulate. Since a reciprocal agreement in 2014, China generally issues U.S. citizens **multi-entry visas valid for up to 10 years** ([China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html#:~:text=result%20in%20denial%20of%20entry,Working%20without%20the%20proper)), with each stay typically limited to 60 or 90 days. To obtain a visa, American travelers need a valid passport (with at least six months’ validity remaining) and an invitation letter or tour itinerary, depending on visa type. The visa application requires a form, photo, and fee – currently around $140 for U.S. citizens for a 10-year multiple-entry visa ([10-Year China Visa, Fees, Application for US, Canadian, UK Citizens](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/10-years.htm?srsltid=AfmBOooE4NKqpgZ0YobFGuJ-MPagPJxnozdjMVZw-l0jKU1d0I1HBjl0#:~:text=10,However%2C)). Processing usually takes 4-5 business days, though expedited service is available for an extra fee. China does not offer visa-on-arrival for U.S. tourists, so one must secure the visa in advance. In addition to tourist and business visas, there are student (X) visas for those enrolling in Chinese universities, work (Z) visas for those with employment in China (which require a government-issued work permit before applying), and family visit (Q/S) visas for visiting relatives. Hong Kong and Macau have separate entry regimes: U.S. citizens can visit Hong Kong visa-free for up to 90 days and Macau visa-free for up to 30 days. But to enter mainland China from Hong Kong/Macau, a China visa is still needed. It’s important to note China’s visa policies can be strict: those with certain criminal records may be denied, and engaging in activities inconsistent with the visa (like working on a tourist visa) can lead to detention or deportation ([China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html#:~:text=result%20in%20denial%20of%20entry,the%20listed%20duration%20of%20stay)). In 2020-2022, China temporarily suspended entry for most foreigners (including Americans) due to COVID-19 and invalidated many existing visas, but as of 2023 it has **resumed issuing tourist visas and honored valid 10-year visas again ([China Visa Application and Requirements | CIBTvisas](https://cibtvisas.com/china-reopening#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2015%2C%202023%2C,your))**. Travelers should also be aware of special travel permits required for Tibet and other sensitive regions, obtainable through authorized Chinese travel agencies. In summary, U.S. citizens must plan ahead to visit China by securing the appropriate visa, which thanks to the bilateral 2014 deal can be a convenient long-term visa allowing multiple trips without reapplying ([China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html#:~:text=result%20in%20denial%20of%20entry,Working%20without%20the%20proper)). Always check the latest Chinese Embassy guidelines, as visa rules can evolve with diplomatic conditions.
