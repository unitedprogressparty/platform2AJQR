## Promoting Stability and Equity in the International Economic Order

Persistent global economic imbalances—such as large trade deficits/surpluses, unsustainable sovereign debt burdens, volatile capital flows, and vast inequalities between nations—pose significant risks to international stability, sustainable development, and shared prosperity. These imbalances often stem from unfair trade practices, inadequate global financial regulation, historical exploitation, and a lack of coordinated international action.

Our platform advocates for a proactive U.S. foreign economic policy aimed at addressing these imbalances through multilateral cooperation, fair trade rules, responsible financial regulation, and support for equitable development. We must work towards a more balanced and stable global economic system that benefits all nations, not just a select few.

### Key Strategies for Addressing Global Economic Imbalances:

1.  **Promote Fair and Balanced Trade:**
    *   Work through international institutions (like the WTO, IMF, World Bank) and bilateral relationships to address persistent trade imbalances driven by unfair practices like currency manipulation, state subsidies that distort competition, and non-tariff barriers.
    *   Advocate for trade agreements that include mechanisms for addressing large, sustained trade deficits/surpluses and promote more balanced economic relationships. (See also section 4.2 Trade Agreements).

2.  **Reform International Financial Architecture:**
    *   Support reforms at the IMF and World Bank to ensure fairer representation for developing countries and to promote policies that support sustainable development and poverty reduction, rather than imposing austerity measures that exacerbate inequality.
    *   Advocate for stronger international coordination on financial regulation to manage volatile capital flows, prevent systemic risk, and combat illicit financial activities (tax evasion, money laundering).

3.  **Address Sovereign Debt Crises:**
    *   Support international mechanisms for orderly and equitable sovereign debt restructuring for countries facing unsustainable debt burdens, preventing prolonged economic crises and humanitarian suffering.
    *   Promote responsible lending and borrowing practices by both creditor and debtor nations.

4.  **Tackle Global Tax Avoidance and Competition:**
    *   Lead international efforts to establish a global minimum corporate tax and combat corporate tax avoidance through profit shifting and the use of tax havens. (See also section 4.9 Tax Competition).
    *   Promote tax transparency and automatic exchange of information between countries to curb illicit financial flows.

5.  **Support Sustainable Development and Reduce Global Inequality:**
    *   Increase and effectively target U.S. development assistance to address the root causes of global poverty and inequality, focusing on health, education, climate resilience, and good governance. (See also section 4.7 Development Assistance and 4.11 Poverty And Inequality).
    *   Ensure U.S. economic policies (trade, investment, finance) support, rather than undermine, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### Conclusion:

Addressing global economic imbalances requires sustained U.S. leadership and commitment to multilateral cooperation. By promoting fair trade, reforming international financial institutions, addressing debt crises, combating tax avoidance, and supporting sustainable development, we can contribute to a more stable, equitable, and prosperous global economy. This approach not only aligns with our values but also enhances our own long-term economic security and global standing.
