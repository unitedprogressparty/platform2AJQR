## Promoting Shared Prosperity and Human Dignity Worldwide

Extreme poverty and vast economic inequality persist across the globe, fueling instability, conflict, poor health outcomes, environmental degradation, and forced migration. These challenges are not only moral failings but also threats to global security and prosperity, including that of the United States. Addressing global poverty and inequality requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond traditional aid and tackles the systemic economic and political structures that perpetuate these disparities.

Our platform commits the U.S. to playing a leading role in the global fight against poverty and inequality. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen social safety nets, empower marginalized communities, ensure fair trade and financial systems, and support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### Key Strategies for Addressing Global Poverty and Inequality:

1.  **Increase and Reform Development Assistance:**
    *   Substantially increase U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget and target it effectively towards poverty reduction, health, education, food security, gender equality, and climate resilience in the poorest countries. (See also section 4.7 Development Assistance).
    *   Prioritize aid that empowers local communities and strengthens local institutions, moving away from top-down or donor-driven approaches.

2.  **Promote Fair Trade and Economic Justice:**
    *   Advocate for international trade rules that benefit developing countries, providing them with fair market access and supporting diversification away from reliance on primary commodity exports. (See also section 4.2 Trade Agreements).
    *   Support efforts to ensure multinational corporations pay fair wages, respect labor rights, and adhere to environmental standards in their global operations.

3.  **Address Illicit Financial Flows and Debt:**
    *   Lead international efforts to combat tax evasion, money laundering, and other illicit financial flows that drain resources from developing countries. Promote tax transparency and beneficial ownership registries. (See also section 4.9 Tax Competition).
    *   Support comprehensive and equitable sovereign debt relief and restructuring mechanisms for heavily indebted poor countries to free up resources for development. (See also section 4.3 Economic Imbalances).

4.  **Invest in Global Health and Education:**
    *   Increase U.S. investment in global health initiatives focused on combating infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria), strengthening health systems, improving maternal and child health, and ensuring access to vaccines and essential medicines.
    *   Support global education programs aimed at increasing access to quality primary and secondary education, particularly for girls and marginalized children.

5.  **Empower Women and Girls:**
    *   Prioritize development programs that promote gender equality, women's economic empowerment, access to education and healthcare (including reproductive health), and participation in political life, recognizing that empowering women is crucial for poverty reduction.

6.  **Support Climate Justice:**
    *   Provide significant climate finance to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to clean energy, acknowledging the disproportionate burden they face from a crisis largely caused by industrialized nations. (See also section 6.1 Climate Change).

7.  **Strengthen Social Protection Systems:**
    *   Support developing countries in building robust social protection systems, including cash transfers, food assistance, and unemployment benefits, to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable populations.

### Conclusion:

Addressing global poverty and inequality is a moral imperative and a strategic necessity. By adopting a foreign policy that integrates robust development assistance, fair trade practices, financial system reform, investments in health and education, gender equality, and climate justice, the United States can contribute significantly to building a more equitable, stable, and prosperous world for all. This commitment reflects our values and enhances our own long-term security and well-being.
