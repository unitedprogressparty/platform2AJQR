## Navigating the U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Competition, Cooperation, and Values

The economic relationship between the United States and China is one of the most consequential in the world, characterized by deep interdependence, growing strategic competition, and significant disagreements over trade practices, human rights, and international norms. Navigating this complex relationship requires a nuanced foreign policy that strategically competes where necessary to protect U.S. interests and values, cooperates on shared global challenges, and avoids unnecessary confrontation.

While recognizing the economic opportunities presented by the vast Chinese market and the potential for mutually beneficial investment, our platform advocates for a clear-eyed approach that addresses China's unfair trade practices, state-sponsored industrial policies, human rights abuses, and actions that undermine the rules-based international order. We must compete effectively while upholding our democratic values and seeking cooperation on transnational threats.

### Key Strategies for Engaging with China's Economy:

1.  **Compete Strategically in Key Technologies:**
    *   Invest heavily in domestic innovation, R&D, and manufacturing capabilities in strategic sectors (e.g., semiconductors, AI, clean energy, biotechnology) to maintain U.S. technological leadership and reduce critical dependencies on China. (See Domestic Agenda section 5.1).
    *   Work with allies to establish secure and resilient supply chains for critical technologies, diversifying away from over-reliance on China. (See section 4.6 Supply Chains).

2.  **Address Unfair Trade Practices:**
    *   Utilize multilateral forums (like the WTO) and coordinated action with allies to challenge and counter China's unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, state subsidies that distort markets, and non-tariff barriers.
    *   Employ targeted trade enforcement tools where necessary, while avoiding broad, indiscriminate tariffs that harm American consumers and businesses.

3.  **Screen Investments for National Security:**
    *   Strengthen and rigorously apply national security reviews (through CFIUS) for inbound Chinese investment in sensitive U.S. sectors.
    *   Develop mechanisms, in coordination with allies, to scrutinize outbound U.S. investment in certain critical technology sectors in China that could bolster its military or surveillance capabilities.

4.  **Promote Human Rights and Labor Standards:**
    *   Use diplomatic pressure, targeted sanctions, and import restrictions (like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act) to hold China accountable for human rights abuses, particularly in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and for the suppression of labor rights.
    *   Ensure U.S. companies operating in or sourcing from China adhere to high ethical standards regarding labor and human rights.

5.  **Seek Cooperation on Shared Global Challenges:**
    *   Maintain open channels of communication and seek cooperation with China on transnational issues where interests align, such as climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, nuclear non-proliferation, and global financial stability. Competition should not preclude cooperation on existential threats.

6.  **Invest in U.S. Competitiveness:**
    *   Recognize that the most effective way to compete with China is to strengthen the U.S. economy from within through investments in education, infrastructure, healthcare, and technological innovation, creating broad-based prosperity and opportunity.

### Conclusion:

The U.S.-China economic relationship requires a strategic, multifaceted approach. While direct economic confrontation carries risks, ignoring China's challenge to the rules-based order and its unfair practices is untenable. We must compete vigorously by investing in our own strengths and working with allies, push back against unfair practices and human rights abuses, and cooperate where possible on shared global challenges. This balanced strategy aims to protect U.S. interests and values while managing competition responsibly and avoiding unnecessary conflict. There is indeed economic opportunity in competing effectively and offering alternatives to China's model, particularly in partnership with allies and developing nations seeking sustainable and equitable growth.
