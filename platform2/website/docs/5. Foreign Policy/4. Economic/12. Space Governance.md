## Ensuring Peaceful, Sustainable, and Equitable Use of Outer Space

As human activity in space accelerates—from satellite deployment and resource exploration to potential tourism and settlement—the need for robust international governance frameworks becomes increasingly urgent. The existing Outer Space Treaty (1967) provides foundational principles but lacks detailed rules and enforcement mechanisms to address modern challenges like space debris, resource extraction rights, traffic management, and the potential weaponization of space.

Our platform advocates for U.S. leadership in developing and strengthening international norms, treaties, and institutions for space governance. We must ensure that outer space remains a domain for peaceful exploration and scientific discovery, managed sustainably and equitably for the benefit of all humanity, not just a few powerful nations or corporations.

### Key Priorities for International Space Governance:

1.  **Strengthen and Update the Outer Space Treaty Framework:**
    *   Initiate multilateral negotiations to update and supplement the Outer Space Treaty with more specific protocols addressing contemporary issues like space debris mitigation, satellite constellation management, and the prevention of an arms race in space.

2.  **Develop Rules for Space Resource Utilization:**
    *   Work through the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and other forums to establish an international framework for the exploration and utilization of space resources (e.g., lunar or asteroid mining). This framework should ensure activities are conducted sustainably, prevent unilateral claims of sovereignty, avoid harmful interference, and potentially include mechanisms for benefit-sharing with the international community, particularly developing nations.

3.  **Establish International Space Traffic Management (STM):**
    *   Promote the development of an international, civilian-led STM system to track objects in orbit, coordinate satellite maneuvers, prevent collisions, and manage the growing problem of space debris. Enhance data sharing and transparency among all space-faring nations and commercial operators.

4.  **Prevent the Weaponization of Space:**
    *   Pursue verifiable international treaties banning the placement of weapons of mass destruction in orbit and the development or deployment of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons that create dangerous debris fields.
    *   Promote transparency and confidence-building measures regarding military space activities to reduce mistrust and prevent conflict. (See also Domestic Agenda section 5.5 regarding evaluation of Space Force).

5.  **Ensure Environmental Protection:**
    *   Develop international guidelines and best practices for minimizing the environmental impact of space activities, including launch emissions, orbital debris generation, and potential contamination of celestial bodies.

6.  **Promote International Scientific Cooperation:**
    *   Continue and expand international collaboration on space science missions, data sharing, and exploration initiatives, fostering peaceful cooperation and maximizing scientific return for humanity. (See also Domestic Agenda section 5.5).

### Conclusion:

Outer space is a global commons, and its governance requires international cooperation and foresight. By leading efforts to update treaties, establish rules for resource use and traffic management, prevent weaponization, protect the space environment, and foster scientific collaboration, the United States can help ensure that space remains a domain of peace, sustainability, and opportunity for all nations for generations to come. Avoiding a "wild west" scenario in space through proactive governance is crucial.
