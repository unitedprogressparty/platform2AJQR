## Investing in Global Well-being as a Foundation for Peace and Prosperity

Effective and equitable international development assistance is not merely charity; it is a crucial investment in global stability, shared prosperity, human rights, and long-term U.S. national interests. Addressing global challenges like poverty, inequality, climate change, conflict, and pandemics requires robust international cooperation and targeted support for sustainable development in low- and middle-income countries.

Our platform calls for a significant reform and expansion of U.S. foreign development assistance, moving away from outdated models often tied to geopolitical interests or corporate priorities. We advocate for aid that is transparent, accountable, locally led, and focused on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and empowering communities to build resilient and equitable futures.

### Key Principles for Reforming Development Assistance:

1.  **Increase Overall Development Aid:**
    *   Commit to significantly increasing the U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget, moving towards the internationally recognized target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI). Adequate funding is essential for meaningful impact.

2.  **Prioritize Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**
    *   Align U.S. development assistance priorities with the SDGs, focusing investments on poverty reduction, food security, health (including global health security), education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and climate action.

3.  **Empower Local Ownership and Leadership:**
    *   Shift towards development models that prioritize local ownership and leadership. Ensure aid programs are designed and implemented in close partnership with recipient country governments, civil society organizations, and local communities, respecting their priorities and expertise.
    *   Increase the proportion of aid channeled directly through local organizations rather than primarily through large international contractors.

4.  **Focus on Addressing Root Causes:**
    *   Target development assistance to address the underlying drivers of instability, conflict, and forced migration, including poverty, inequality, lack of economic opportunity, poor governance, corruption, and climate vulnerability. (See also section 12. International Cooperation).

5.  **Promote Climate Resilience and Adaptation:**
    *   Significantly increase funding for climate adaptation and resilience projects in vulnerable developing countries, helping them cope with the impacts of a crisis they did little to cause. Support investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction.

6.  **Enhance Transparency and Accountability:**
    *   Implement rigorous transparency standards for all U.S. development assistance, making data on funding, projects, and results publicly accessible.
    *   Strengthen monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure aid effectiveness and accountability, learning from both successes and failures. Combat corruption within aid programs.

7.  **Untie Aid:**
    *   Reduce the practice of "tied aid," where assistance is conditional on purchasing goods or services from U.S. companies. Untying aid allows recipient countries to procure goods and services more cost-effectively and supports local markets.

8.  **Coordinate with Multilateral Institutions:**
    *   Strengthen U.S. engagement and financial support for effective multilateral development institutions (e.g., UN agencies, World Bank IDA, regional development banks) to leverage resources and coordinate global efforts.

### Conclusion:

Reforming U.S. development assistance is a critical component of a progressive foreign policy. By increasing funding, aligning aid with sustainable development goals, empowering local partners, enhancing transparency, and focusing on root causes, we can make U.S. aid more effective, equitable, and impactful. This approach not only reflects American values of compassion and global responsibility but also contributes directly to a more stable, prosperous, and secure world, which ultimately benefits the United States.
