title: "Uzbekistan: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis"
---

### **Preface**

Uzbekistan, a landlocked country in Central Asia, has been increasingly significant for the United States in recent years. The relationship has evolved post-2016 under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who introduced several reforms aimed at improving governance and enhancing economic ties with foreign partners, including the U.S. Recent events, such as Uzbekistan's role in facilitating the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, have highlighted its strategic importance. The U.S. seeks to bolster its partnership with Uzbekistan to address regional security threats, enhance trade relations, and promote democratic reforms.

### **Crises**:

Uzbekistan faces several crises, both domestically and regionally. Internally, the country grapples with issues related to political dissent and human rights abuses. Reports indicate that despite Mirziyoyev's reforms, challenges remain regarding freedom of expression and the treatment of political prisoners. Externally, the region is affected by the fallout from the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, raising concerns about increased instability and the potential for terrorism spilling over into Central Asia. This situation poses a direct threat to Uzbekistan's security and requires a coordinated approach from the U.S. to manage these risks.

Furthermore, Uzbekistan is experiencing economic challenges exacerbated by the global economic downturn, including inflation and unemployment. The government's efforts to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on natural resources are ongoing but face obstacles. The region also anticipates future crises related to water scarcity and climate change, which could lead to tensions with neighboring countries, particularly in the context of shared water resources in the Aral Sea basin.

The geopolitical landscape is complicated by the presence of Russia and China, both of which have significant influence in Central Asia. Uzbekistan's balancing act between these powers, along with its aspirations for greater engagement with the West, presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S. foreign policy. The potential rise of radical groups in the region, fueled by economic disenfranchisement and ideological extremism, is another looming crisis that could destabilize Uzbekistan and the surrounding areas.

**Frank Narrative** 

Uzbekistan has historically been a key player in Central Asian geopolitics, given its strategic location and resources. The United States has a vested interest in promoting stability in Uzbekistan, particularly as it navigates complex regional dynamics involving Russia and China. The U.S. aims to strengthen its partnership with Uzbekistan to counterbalance Russian influence and to support the country's reforms towards a more open and democratic society. This partnership is further underscored by Uzbekistan’s potential role in counterterrorism efforts, especially in light of the evolving security landscape following the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan.

The U.S. looks to Uzbekistan to continue its role in facilitating regional security and economic cooperation. By fostering greater collaboration in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and military exercises, Uzbekistan can help the U.S. achieve its broader goals of stability and security in Central Asia. The U.S. also desires Uzbekistan's cooperation in energy security, particularly as it seeks to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. The potential for Uzbekistan to emerge as a key player in energy transit routes can further align with U.S. strategic interests.

In return, Uzbekistan seeks support from the U.S. to bolster its economic reforms, enhance technological capabilities, and improve governance. The country requires assistance in addressing domestic challenges such as corruption, judicial independence, and economic diversification. By collaborating on these issues, the U.S. can play a pivotal role in supporting Uzbekistan’s development while also ensuring that U.S. interests are safeguarded in the region.

As Uzbekistan continues to navigate its path towards reform and modernization, the U.S. must remain engaged and proactive in its approach. This includes fostering deeper economic ties through trade agreements, facilitating investment opportunities, and promoting educational exchanges. By doing so, the U.S. can help Uzbekistan stabilize its economy while addressing the underlying issues that threaten regional security and cooperation.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Uzbekistan has been instrumental in U.S. strategic interests, particularly in counterterrorism and regional stability. The country's geographic location makes it a critical player in the fight against extremism, as it shares borders with Afghanistan and has a history of dealing with radical movements. In the future, the U.S. would like Uzbekistan to actively participate in multilateral security frameworks and enhance its intelligence-sharing capabilities to counter regional threats effectively.

Additionally, Uzbekistan can help the U.S. achieve its energy security goals by improving transit routes for energy supplies from Central Asia to international markets. This would not only benefit Uzbekistan economically but also reduce reliance on Russian energy sources, thereby aligning with U.S. interests in diversifying energy supplies.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Uzbekistan needs support from the U.S. and the international community to address several domestic challenges. Economic diversification is a top priority, as the country seeks to reduce its dependence on cotton and natural gas. U.S. investment in technology, infrastructure, and education can help Uzbekistan build a more resilient economy.

Moreover, Uzbekistan requires assistance in governance and human rights reforms. The U.S. can play a vital role in providing technical expertise and best practices in building democratic institutions, enhancing judicial independence, and promoting civil society engagement.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Uzbekistan is located in Central Asia and is the most populous country in the region, with a population of approximately 34 million. The capital is Tashkent, and the country is characterized by a diverse geography that includes desert regions and mountain ranges. Uzbekistan's political system is a presidential republic, with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in power since 2016. The economy is primarily based on natural resources, with significant contributions from cotton, gold, and natural gas. Uzbekistan's GDP growth has been steady in recent years, and the country has made strides in improving the quality of life for its citizens. However, challenges remain in areas such as corruption and political freedoms, with a freedom index score of 6.0 (out of 10) according to Freedom House.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Uzbekistan's strategic location makes it a crucial player in regional stability and security. It serves as a key transit route for energy supplies and trade between Europe and Asia. The country's vast natural resources, particularly in energy and minerals, are of significant interest to global markets. Additionally, Uzbekistan's role in counterterrorism efforts is vital for U.S. interests, particularly in light of the situation in Afghanistan and the ongoing threat of extremist groups in the region.

**Democracy Score:**

Uzbekistan's political landscape is characterized by a ruling party dominated by President Mirziyoyev, who has initiated several reforms aimed at improving governance. However, challenges remain regarding political freedoms, with limitations on freedom of speech and assembly. The government has faced criticism for its handling of dissent and human rights issues. The current administration has emphasized economic development and stability, but the gap between official structures and real-world political dynamics remains significant.

**Historical Context:**

  The relationship between the U.S. and Uzbekistan has evolved significantly since the independence of Uzbekistan in 1991.

However, relations cooled after 2005 due to human rights concerns following the Andijan uprising.

  Major agreements include the 2002 Partnership for Peace agreement and cooperation in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism. The bilateral relationship has occasionally faced strains due to human rights abuses and governance issues, but recent reforms have opened new avenues for cooperation.
