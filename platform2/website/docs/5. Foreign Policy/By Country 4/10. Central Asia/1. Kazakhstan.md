### 

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Kazakhstan has evolved significantly since Kazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The U.S. views Kazakhstan as a pivotal partner in Central Asia due to its strategic location, vast energy resources, and role in countering regional security threats. Recent events such as the civil unrest in January 2022, which was driven by rising fuel prices and broader socio-economic grievances, have highlighted the need for stability in the region. The U.S. has expressed support for Kazakhstan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity while encouraging reforms towards greater democratic governance. This relationship is marked by cooperation in areas such as energy security, counterterrorism, and trade, although challenges remain in governance and human rights.

### **Crises**:

Kazakhstan currently faces several crises that affect its internal stability and regional dynamics. The civil unrest in early 2022 was a significant event, sparked by economic grievances but rooted in broader discontent with the government’s authoritarian practices. The government's response, which included a crackdown on protests and political dissent, raised concerns about human rights and the rule of law. The aftermath has left the country grappling with social tensions and calls for reform, creating an unpredictable political landscape.

Regionally, Kazakhstan is also affected by the geopolitical tensions stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan has to navigate its relationship with Russia carefully, balancing economic ties with the need to assert its sovereignty. This situation raises fears of potential spillover effects, including increased Russian influence and the possibility of destabilizing movements within Kazakhstan itself.

Additionally, the rise of militant groups in Central Asia poses a security threat to Kazakhstan. The region has seen an increase in radicalization, and the potential for spillover violence from neighboring countries remains a concern. The U.S. remains focused on counterterrorism efforts in the region, and Kazakhstan plays a strategic role in those initiatives.

Looking forward, Kazakhstan faces the risk of further internal unrest if socio-economic conditions do not improve and if the government fails to implement meaningful reforms. The potential for increased authoritarianism under the guise of stability could exacerbate discontent among the populace, leading to further crises.

**Frank Narrative**

Kazakhstan’s strategic importance to the United States lies primarily in its vast energy resources and geographic location. It is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas, making it a crucial player in global energy markets. The U.S. seeks to diversify its energy sources and reduce dependency on less stable regions, and Kazakhstan’s resources are an essential asset in this regard. By supporting Kazakhstan in developing its energy sector, the U.S. can secure a more stable energy supply while also promoting economic growth within Kazakhstan.

In addition to energy security, Kazakhstan has been a critical ally in U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Central Asia. The country has cooperated with the U.S. in intelligence sharing and military training to combat the rise of extremist groups in the region. This partnership enhances regional stability and reflects Kazakhstan’s commitment to combat terrorism, which aligns with U.S. interests. The U.S. can further strengthen this cooperation by providing additional resources and training to Kazakhstan’s security forces, ensuring that they are well-equipped to handle emerging threats.

Looking ahead, the U.S. desires to see Kazakhstan embrace democratic reforms and improve its human rights record. This is essential not only for the well-being of the Kazakh people but also for fostering a more stable and predictable partnership. The U.S. can encourage these reforms through diplomatic engagement, conditional economic assistance, and support for civil society organizations within Kazakhstan. By promoting democratic values, the U.S. aims to create an environment that is conducive to long-term stability and economic growth.

Kazakhstan, in turn, needs continued U.S. support to address its domestic challenges, including economic diversification and governance reforms. The country recognizes that reliance on oil and gas makes it vulnerable to market fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. By assisting Kazakhstan in diversifying its economy and enhancing its technological capabilities, the U.S. can help create a more resilient and stable partner. Furthermore, Kazakhstan seeks to position itself as a leader in the region, and U.S. support in international forums can bolster these aspirations.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Kazakhstan is located in Central Asia, bordered by Russia to the north, China to the east, and several Central Asian nations to the south. It is the world's largest landlocked country and has a diverse population of approximately 19 million people. The political system is a republic, with a president serving as the head of state. Kazakhstan's GDP is approximately $180 billion, with a per capita income of around $9,000. The economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas, which account for a significant portion of its exports. While the country has made progress in improving the quality of life, challenges remain, including income inequality and regional disparities. According to the Freedom House Index, Kazakhstan scores low on political rights and civil liberties, reflecting ongoing authoritarian governance.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Kazakhstan's strategic location makes it a critical player in regional and global stability. It serves as a vital transit route for energy supplies from Central Asia to Europe and is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, which enhances its economic ties with Russia and other neighboring countries. The country's rich natural resources, particularly in energy, make it an essential partner for the U.S. in achieving energy security and reducing dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Furthermore, Kazakhstan's cooperation in counterterrorism initiatives helps address regional security concerns and aligns with U.S. strategic interests in combating extremism.

**Democracy Score:**

Kazakhstan's political landscape has been dominated by the ruling party, Nur Otan, which has maintained a tight grip on power since independence. While the country has held elections, they are often criticized for lacking competitiveness and transparency. Governance practices have shown limited progress toward democratic reforms, and civil liberties remain restricted. Protests against the government have been met with a heavy-handed response, further stifling political dissent. The current president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who succeeded Nursultan Nazarbayev, has promised reforms but faces skepticism regarding their genuine implementation.

### **3. Current Challenges and Opportunities**

**Political & Governance Issues:**

**Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**

Kazakhstan's governance practices face criticism for human rights abuses, lack of political freedoms, and suppression of dissent.

Improving these conditions is essential for fostering a more robust bilateral relationship and addressing U.S. concerns about authoritarianism.

**Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**

The political landscape in Kazakhstan is marked by uncertainty, with internal dynamics and public discontent posing risks to government stability. Protests against the government could re-emerge if economic conditions do not improve or if the government fails to implement meaningful reforms. The U.S. should monitor these developments closely and engage with Kazakhstan to encourage stability and democratic governance.

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

**Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**

Kazakhstan's reliance on oil and gas exports creates vulnerabilities in its economy, particularly in the face of fluctuating global prices. While the U.S. has not imposed sanctions on Kazakhstan, challenges related to market access and bureaucratic hurdles exist. The U.S. should work with Kazakhstan to address these issues and promote a more balanced trade relationship.

**Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**

Kazakhstan has experienced migration trends, particularly among ethnic Kazakhs returning from abroad. The public's attitude toward the U.S. remains generally positive, with opportunities for increased cultural exchange and collaboration in education and research.

**Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**

While both nations share an interest in stability and development, differences in governance and human rights practices may create tensions. Engaging in dialogue about shared values can help foster understanding and cooperation.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

**Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**

Kazakhstan faces environmental challenges such as desertification and water scarcity, which could exacerbate social and economic tensions. Climate change impacts are felt globally, necessitating collaborative efforts to address these issues.

**Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**

The U.S. can support Kazakhstan in transitioning to renewable energy sources and enhancing environmental sustainability through joint initiatives. This collaboration can strengthen bilateral ties and address shared climate challenges.
