# **Croatia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Croatia share a strong and growing strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, Croatia's successful post-conflict transition and integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, and close cooperation on regional security in Southeastern Europe. Since gaining independence in 1991 and enduring the subsequent war, Croatia has become a stable democracy, joining NATO in 2009 and the European Union in 2013 (later adopting the Euro and joining the Schengen Area in 2023). The U.S. strongly supported Croatia's independence and its path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. Current relations are **excellent and collaborative**, characterized by robust defense cooperation within NATO, alignment on supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression, partnership on energy security and diversification in the region, and cooperation on promoting stability and EU integration for the Western Balkans.

### **Crises**

Croatia faces several challenges, primarily related to regional dynamics and economic factors. The **legacy of the 1990s wars** in the former Yugoslavia continues to shape regional relations, particularly with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Ensuring long-term stability, reconciliation, and addressing unresolved issues (missing persons, war crimes accountability) remain important. The political situation in neighboring **Bosnia and Herzegovina**, including ethno-nationalist tensions and secessionist threats from Republika Srpska (supported by Serbia/Russia), poses a direct challenge to regional stability and Croatia's interests (given the large Croat population in BiH).

Economically, while Croatia has benefited significantly from EU membership, challenges remain in boosting **long-term growth potential**, improving the **business climate**, combating **corruption**, addressing **regional disparities**, and managing **demographic decline** due to emigration and low birth rates. Ensuring effective absorption and utilization of **EU recovery funds** for structural reforms and green/digital transitions is crucial.

Regionally, Croatia is impacted by the broader **European security crisis** caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, contributing to collective defense efforts and dealing with economic consequences. It also faces challenges related to **energy security** (though developing LNG import capacity via Krk terminal) and potential **malign influence** (Russian, Chinese) seeking to exploit regional vulnerabilities or divisions.

Anticipated future crises could include renewed **instability in Bosnia and Herzegovina**, potentially impacting Croatia. **Economic shocks** or failure to effectively utilize EU recovery funds could hinder growth. **Climate change impacts** (sea-level rise affecting its long coastline, droughts, heatwaves impacting tourism/agriculture) pose long-term risks. Maintaining political stability and continuing reforms amidst these pressures is key.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Croatia is a valuable ally contributing significantly to U.S. goals in Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and within NATO/EU frameworks. Its primary contribution is serving as a **stable, democratic, and pro-Western anchor in the Western Balkans**, promoting Euro-Atlantic integration for the entire region. As a **committed NATO ally**, Croatia contributes forces to Alliance missions (e.g., eFP battlegroups in Poland/Lithuania, KFOR in Kosovo, historically in Afghanistan), participates actively in exercises, and is modernizing its military (acquiring U.S. Black Hawk helicopters, Bradley fighting vehicles; French Rafale jets). Its strategic location on the Adriatic Sea enhances **NATO's southern flank security** and maritime awareness. Croatia has been a strong **supporter of Ukraine**, providing military and humanitarian aid and enforcing EU sanctions against Russia. As an **EU member state**, Croatia contributes to transatlantic alignment on key foreign policy issues and supports the **EU integration process for its neighbors** (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, etc.), a core U.S. objective for regional stability. Croatia plays an important role in **regional energy security**, hosting the Krk LNG import terminal, which helps diversify gas supplies for itself and neighbors (like Hungary, Slovenia), reducing reliance on Russian energy. It also cooperates with the U.S. on **counterterrorism** and combating transnational crime in the region.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Croatia's continued and enhanced contributions. Maintaining robust **NATO commitments**, including defense spending (moving towards 2% GDP target) and military modernization, is essential. Continued strong **support for Ukraine** and alignment on **sanctions against Russia** are vital. The U.S. encourages Croatia to play a leading role in promoting **stability and Euro-Atlantic integration in the Western Balkans**, particularly using its influence constructively in **Bosnia and Herzegovina** to support state functionality and reforms. Expanding the capacity of the **Krk LNG terminal** and supporting regional energy diversification efforts further enhances European energy security. Enhanced cooperation on **maritime security** in the Adriatic and potentially the wider Mediterranean is also sought. Concrete actions could include Croatia increasing its contributions to NATO missions, actively championing EU enlargement/reforms in BiH, investing further in energy infrastructure, and deepening regional security cooperation. Accountability is maintained through NATO processes, regular bilateral dialogues, and EU coordination mechanisms.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a NATO/EU member in a complex region, Croatia's needs from the U.S. and the world focus on security cooperation, economic partnership, and support for regional stability. A key need is **continued U.S. commitment to European security through NATO**, including stability in Southeastern Europe and the Adriatic/Mediterranean region. Close **defense cooperation** with the U.S., including access to advanced military technology and equipment (e.g., Bradleys, Black Hawks, potentially future systems) and joint training/exercises, is crucial for modernizing Croatian Armed Forces and ensuring interoperability.

Economically, Croatia needs continued **integration within the EU single market** and effective utilization of **EU funds** (Cohesion, Recovery and Resilience Facility) to boost growth, address regional disparities, and support green/digital transitions. It benefits from a **stable global economic environment** and open markets for its exports (tourism, machinery, food). Continued **U.S. investment** (particularly in energy, IT, tourism, defense industry) and strong transatlantic trade ties are important. Support for its role as a **regional energy hub** (Krk LNG expansion, pipeline interconnectors) requires international partnership and investment.

Diplomatically, Croatia needs strong international support, including from the U.S., for **stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina** based on the Dayton Accords framework while ensuring the rights of the Croat community there. It seeks partnership in promoting the **EU integration of the Western Balkans**. Support for **maritime security** in the Adriatic is also a need. Finally, Croatia benefits from continued close **people-to-people ties** and cultural/educational exchanges with the U.S. and the world.
