# **Gabon: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Gabon have maintained diplomatic relations since Gabon's independence in 1960. Historically, the relationship was characterized by stability, largely due to Gabon's political continuity under President Omar Bongo (1967-2009) and his son Ali Bongo Ondimba (2009-2023), and its role as a significant oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea. U.S. interests focused on energy security, regional stability, and significant cooperation on environmental conservation, particularly protecting Gabon's vast rainforests, often referred to as "Africa's Eden." However, the relationship entered a period of uncertainty following the **August 2023 military coup** that ousted Ali Bongo shortly after disputed elections. The U.S. officially declared the military takeover a coup in October 2023, triggering restrictions on certain types of foreign assistance under Section 7008 of the U.S. appropriations act. Current relations are therefore **strained and under review**, with the U.S. engaging cautiously with the transitional government led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, urging a swift and credible transition back to democratic rule while continuing vital support for conservation efforts. The U.S. seeks a return to constitutional governance and democratic norms, while navigating the complex internal political dynamics and regional implications of the coup.

### **Crises**

The most significant crisis facing Gabon is the **political crisis** stemming from the August 2023 coup. While the coup was met with popular celebration in Libreville, ending nearly 56 years of Bongo family rule perceived as corrupt and out of touch, it represents a rupture of constitutional order. The transitional government faces the challenge of organizing credible elections and returning the country to democratic rule within a promised timeframe (initially suggested as two years, but timelines remain uncertain). There is a risk of prolonged military rule or a flawed transition that fails to meet democratic standards, potentially leading to internal instability or international isolation. This political uncertainty also creates an **economic crisis** of confidence, potentially deterring foreign investment crucial for diversifying Gabon's oil-dependent economy.

Regionally, Gabon is situated in Central Africa, a neighborhood marked by varying degrees of instability (e.g., Central African Republic, parts of DRC, Cameroon). While Gabon itself has been an island of relative stability, the coup adds to a trend of military takeovers in West and Central Africa (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea), raising concerns about democratic backsliding across the continent. This regional context of **democratic recession and insecurity** could embolden anti-democratic forces or create spillover effects.

Gabon also faces a long-term **environmental crisis** related to climate change and biodiversity loss, despite its strong conservation record. Its extensive coastline is vulnerable to sea-level rise, and changes in rainfall patterns could affect its rainforest ecosystems and agriculture. While Gabon has been a leader in conservation (protecting over 20% of its land and significant marine areas), pressures from illegal logging, poaching, and potential future expansion of resource extraction (if economic diversification falters) pose ongoing threats to its unique biodiversity, which is considered a global public good.

Anticipated future crises include potential **social unrest** if the transitional government fails to deliver on economic improvements or democratic promises, or if elite power struggles emerge within the new regime. An **economic shock** due to volatile oil prices or failure to manage the transition away from oil dependency could also destabilize the country. Furthermore, while Gabon has avoided major internal conflict, underlying ethnic tensions or grievances, if exploited during a period of political uncertainty, could pose a future risk, although this is considered low compared to neighbors. The primary anticipated crisis remains the successful navigation of the political transition back to a stable, legitimate, and democratic government.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Historically, Gabon has contributed to U.S. regional goals primarily through its **environmental leadership and relative stability**. Under the Bongo administrations, Gabon became a global leader in conservation, setting aside vast tracts of rainforest (part of the Congo Basin, the world's second-largest tropical forest) and creating a network of national parks and marine protected areas, often with U.S. technical and financial support (e.g., through USFWS, USAID). This directly supported U.S. goals related to combating climate change (forests as carbon sinks) and preserving global biodiversity. Gabon hosted U.S. military exercises (e.g., related to maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea) and participated in regional security initiatives aimed at combating piracy and illicit trafficking, contributing to maritime security in a vital energy transit zone. Its political stability, though achieved under authoritarian rule, provided a predictable partner for the U.S. in a volatile region. Gabon also played a modest diplomatic role within the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the African Union.

Looking forward, a **democratically restored and stable Gabon** could significantly aid U.S. regional goals. Firstly, it could serve as a **positive example of democratic transition** in a region plagued by coups, reinforcing U.S. policy promoting democracy and constitutionalism in Africa. A successful transition, supported by U.S. diplomacy, would counter narratives of democratic decline. Secondly, Gabon can continue and potentially enhance its role as a **leader in environmental conservation and climate action**. The U.S. would like Gabon to maintain its commitment to forest protection, potentially participating in carbon market initiatives (like REDD+) and championing Congo Basin conservation efforts regionally. Concrete actions could include Gabon strengthening enforcement against illegal logging and wildlife trafficking, supported by U.S. capacity building, and promoting sustainable economic alternatives to resource depletion. Thirdly, Gabon can be a valuable partner in **maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea**. The U.S. seeks enhanced Gabonese participation in regional maritime security frameworks (like the Yaoundé Architecture), including intelligence sharing and joint patrols to counter piracy, illegal fishing, and trafficking. U.S. Naval Forces Africa (NAVAF) could increase training exercises with the Gabonese Navy, with benchmarks focused on interdictions and maritime domain awareness. Fourthly, a stable Gabon can contribute to **regional stability** through ECCAS and the AU, potentially playing a mediating role in nearby crises (e.g., CAR, DRC) if it regains its diplomatic footing post-transition. Accountability for future contributions would involve clear benchmarks set during the democratic transition process, linking resumption of full U.S. assistance and partnership to measurable progress on democratic reforms, conservation commitments, and security cooperation.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Following the 2023 coup, Gabon's primary need from the U.S. and the international community is **support for a credible and timely transition back to democratic rule**. This includes diplomatic engagement with the transitional authorities to encourage adherence to a clear roadmap for elections, technical assistance for electoral preparations (e.g., voter registration, constitutional review) potentially channeled through the UN or regional bodies like ECCAS/AU, and support for Gabonese civil society organizations working on democracy and governance monitoring. The U.S. should condition the full resumption of non-humanitarian assistance on tangible progress towards elections and restoration of constitutional order, using Section 7008 restrictions as leverage while maintaining channels for dialogue. Benchmarks should include the establishment of an independent electoral commission, adoption of an inclusive constitution, and holding of free and fair elections within the agreed timeframe.

Economically, Gabon urgently needs support for **diversification away from oil dependency**. With oil reserves declining, Gabon must develop non-oil sectors like sustainable forestry, agriculture, fisheries, and eco-tourism. The U.S. can provide technical assistance through USAID and USDA for developing sustainable agricultural value chains, support SMEs in the tourism sector, and potentially offer DFC financing for investments in renewable energy (solar) or sustainable infrastructure. International partners like the World Bank and African Development Bank, with U.S. backing, can fund programs aimed at improving the business climate, reducing corruption, and enhancing workforce skills through vocational training. Success would be measured by growth in non-oil GDP and improved rankings on ease of doing business indices.

Gabon requires continued international support for its **pioneering conservation efforts**. This includes sustained funding for national park management, anti-poaching patrols, scientific research, and development of sustainable livelihoods for communities living near protected areas. The U.S. (through USFWS, State Department programs, USAID) and international conservation NGOs are key partners. Gabon also needs support to access international **climate finance** mechanisms (e.g., Green Climate Fund, carbon markets) to monetize its forest conservation efforts (e.g., through selling carbon credits, as seen in its 2022 deal with the Central African Forest Initiative - CAFI). The U.S. can provide technical expertise in developing carbon accounting frameworks and advocating for Gabon's access to these funds. Benchmarks include maintained forest cover, reduced poaching rates, and successful participation in international carbon finance schemes.

Finally, Gabon needs assistance in **strengthening governance and transparency**, particularly in the management of natural resource revenues. Technical assistance from the IMF/World Bank on public financial management, support for Gabon joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) (which it has committed to in the past but implementation lagged), and capacity building for anti-corruption bodies are crucial. Supporting investigative journalism and civil society oversight can also contribute. Success metrics include improved scores on corruption indices and public availability of government contracts and revenues from the extractive sector.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Gabonese Republic is located on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, straddling the equator. It borders Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and the Republic of the Congo. Its geography is dominated by dense tropical rainforests (covering nearly 90% of the country), coastal plains, and savanna in the east and south. Population is small, around **2.4 million** (2023 estimate).
- Until the August 2023 coup, Gabon was nominally a **republic with a presidential system**, but was effectively dominated by the Bongo family and the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) for over five decades. It is currently under a **transitional military government**.
- Gabon is an **upper-middle-income country** due to its oil wealth, but this wealth is highly concentrated. GDP is around **$20-22 billion**, with a high GDP per capita for the region (approx. **$8,800**), but this masks significant inequality and poverty. Oil accounts for the majority of exports and government revenue, making the economy vulnerable to price fluctuations.
- Quality of life indicators are mixed: relatively high income per capita but poor social indicators compared to countries with similar income levels. Life expectancy is around **67 years**. Access to basic services is better than regional averages but still limited outside urban centers.
- Freedom House ranked Gabon as **“Not Free”** even before the coup (score around 20/100), citing flawed elections, corruption, and limits on freedoms. The coup further suspended constitutional freedoms.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Gabon's primary importance lies in its **significant oil production** in the Gulf of Guinea, contributing to global energy supplies (though production is declining).
- Its vast **rainforests** are critical for global climate regulation (Congo Basin carbon sink) and biodiversity, making its conservation efforts of international importance.
- Its location on the Gulf of Guinea gives it strategic importance for **maritime security** in a region prone to piracy and trafficking.
- Historically, its political stability made it a predictable, albeit undemocratic, partner for the U.S. in a volatile region. Its potential return to democracy could serve as a positive regional example.

**Democracy Score:**

- Prior to the coup, Gabon held regular elections, but they were widely seen as flawed and marred by irregularities, ensuring the Bongo family's continued rule. The PDG dominated the legislature. Freedoms of press and assembly were restricted.
- Currently, the country is ruled by the **Committee for the Transition and Restoration of Institutions (CTRI)**, a military junta led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, who serves as transitional president. Constitutional governance is suspended. The junta has promised a transition back to civilian rule, including a national dialogue, constitutional referendum, and elections, but the timeline and credibility remain uncertain. No political parties are formally in charge during the transition.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - **1960:** Gabon gains independence from France; U.S. establishes relations.
  - **1967-2009:** Era of Omar Bongo; stable relations focused on oil, security, and later conservation. Close ties with France remained dominant.
  - **2002:** President Omar Bongo designates 10% of Gabon's territory as national parks, initiating strong conservation partnership with U.S. (e.g., USFWS support).
  - **2009:** Ali Bongo succeeds his father after disputed election. Relations continue, focus on environment grows (e.g., significant marine protected areas established).
  - **2016 & 2019:** Disputed elections and alleged coup attempt raise concerns about stability and democracy.
  - **August 30, 2023:** Military coup ousts Ali Bongo following another contested election.
  - **October 2023:** U.S. formally determines a coup occurred, triggering aid restrictions under Section 7008. Cautious engagement with transitional government begins.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - No direct conflicts. Partnership focused on energy, environment, and regional stability.
  - Key agreements include bilateral investment treaty (BIT), cooperation MOUs on conservation (e.g., Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment - CARPE, supported by USAID), maritime security cooperation, and participation in AGOA.
  - Bilateral relations are currently **strained** due to the coup and suspension of certain aid. The U.S. is balancing its legal requirement to restrict aid following a coup with the desire to support the Gabonese people, maintain conservation programs, and encourage a swift return to democracy.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Gabon trade is modest, around **$300-500 million** annually. U.S. imports are dominated by crude oil and manganese. U.S. exports include machinery, poultry, vehicles, and equipment for the oil sector.
  - Gabon's main trading partners are China (major buyer of oil and timber), France, and other EU countries.
  - U.S. FDI is primarily in the oil and gas sector (e.g., Vaalco Energy). French companies have historically dominated the non-oil private sector. Chinese investment has grown, particularly in infrastructure and resource extraction.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - **Oil** remains Gabon's key strategic resource, though production is mature and declining. **Manganese** is another major export (Gabon is one of the world's top producers). **Timber** from its vast forests is also significant, raising sustainability concerns.
  - Gabon has sought partnerships for economic diversification, including developing downstream processing for resources and promoting tourism. Its participation in initiatives like the **Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI)**, receiving funds for conservation performance, is a key international partnership. The U.S. supports these efforts indirectly through multilateral banks and conservation funding.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - Primary shared concern is **maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea**, including piracy, illegal fishing, and narcotics trafficking, which affects international shipping and energy transport.
  - Regional instability (CAR, DRC) poses indirect threats. Transnational poaching and illegal logging undermine conservation efforts and rule of law. There is no significant internal insurgency or terrorism threat within Gabon itself.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - U.S.-Gabon military cooperation focused on maritime security capacity building (training, exercises like Obangame Express) and professionalization of Gabonese forces. Some Gabonese officers receive training in the U.S. (IMET program, now likely suspended due to coup).
  - Gabon participates in ECCAS security mechanisms. It has contributed troops to regional peacekeeping missions in the past (e.g., in CAR).
  - Following the coup, direct U.S. military assistance is restricted. Future cooperation hinges on the return to democratic rule, but could potentially resume focusing on maritime security and peacekeeping capabilities.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Gabon's influence stems from its historical stability, oil wealth (providing resources for diplomacy), and environmental leadership. It plays an active role in **ECCAS** and the **African Union**. It has served on the UN Security Council non-permanently.
  - Its conservation efforts give it a prominent voice in international environmental forums (UNFCCC, CITES).
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Gabon has potential to contribute to regional conflict resolution efforts within ECCAS, particularly concerning CAR or maritime security coordination. Its leadership on conservation provides a platform for multilateral cooperation on climate and biodiversity, which the U.S. can leverage. Post-transition, a democratic Gabon could be a stronger partner in promoting regional stability and good governance.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - The coup suspended the constitution and dissolved democratic institutions. While the junta promised reforms, respect for human rights (freedom of speech, assembly) under military rule is uncertain. Pre-coup concerns included flawed elections, corruption, and inequality. Rule of law remains weak.
  - The U.S. response is constrained by the coup determination, limiting engagement but maintaining diplomatic channels to press for democratic transition and human rights respect.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - The transitional government appears stable for now, having consolidated control. However, the long-term stability depends on managing the transition effectively, addressing economic grievances, and navigating potential power struggles within the elite. Policy continuity is uncertain, particularly regarding economic reforms and democratic commitments.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - African Union (AU) (Gabon's membership currently suspended due to coup)
  - ECCAS (Economic Community of Central African States)
  - CEEAC (Communauté Économique des États de l'Afrique Centrale - French acronym for ECCAS)
  - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (Gabon rejoined in 2016)
  - African Development Bank (AfDB)
  - International Criminal Court (ICC)
  - Various environmental treaties (CITES, UNFCCC/Paris Agreement, etc.)
  - Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with U.S.
  - AGOA eligibility (potentially impacted by coup/human rights reviews)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Main concern is **over-dependence on oil** and lack of economic diversification. Corruption and bureaucratic hurdles impede investment and trade. U.S. aid restrictions following the coup impact non-humanitarian assistance, potentially affecting some economic support programs. Loss of AGOA eligibility would harm non-oil exports.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Post-transition, opportunities lie in supporting **economic diversification**. This includes promoting investment in sustainable forestry, fisheries, agriculture, and eco-tourism. Supporting Gabon's capacity to negotiate fair contracts for resource extraction and manage revenues transparently (e.g., via EITI) is crucial. A stable, democratic Gabon could potentially explore deeper trade arrangements with the U.S. or regional partners.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Instability in neighboring countries (CAR, DRC) is a background concern. Gabon's relationship with France (former colonial power, still influential) and China (major economic partner) shapes its geopolitical positioning. The coup strained relations with regional bodies (AU, ECCAS suspended Gabon initially).
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Low risk of terrorism or major military escalation involving Gabon directly. Main risks are **maritime insecurity** in the Gulf of Guinea and potential internal instability if the democratic transition falters. Cybersecurity capacity is low.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Gabon hosts migrants from neighboring African countries but is not a major source of migration to the U.S. Small Gabonese diaspora in U.S./Europe. Cultural exchange is limited. Public opinion initially welcomed the coup as liberation from Bongo rule, but expectations for democratic change and economic improvement are high.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Mix of Christian and traditional beliefs. Strong ties to French language and culture among elites. Divergence with U.S. on democratic values historically under Bongo rule; potential for greater alignment if democratic transition succeeds. Shared global value placed on environmental conservation.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Gabon vulnerable to sea-level rise (coastal infrastructure) and changes in rainfall affecting forests/agriculture. U.S. interest lies in preserving Gabon's role as a carbon sink and biodiversity hotspot, and regional stability.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Major opportunities exist to support Gabon's conservation leadership through funding (bilateral, multilateral, carbon markets), technical assistance for park management/anti-poaching, and promoting sustainable alternatives (eco-tourism, renewable energy - solar potential).
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Unsustainable logging or resource extraction could undermine conservation gains and potentially fuel local grievances. Regional cooperation on managing shared ecosystems (Congo Basin) is vital.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term likely would have shown **less interest in Gabon's conservation efforts** and democracy promotion, potentially reducing funding for environmental programs and overlooking governance issues in favor of transactional interests (e.g., oil access, counter-piracy cooperation). Rhetoric might have focused narrowly on economic deals or security contributions.
- Support for multilateral environmental initiatives like CAFI or climate finance might have waned. Aid restrictions following the coup might have been applied inconsistently or lifted based on narrow U.S. interests rather than democratic progress.
- The impact could have been a weakening of U.S. influence on conservation and governance, potentially emboldening authoritarian elements or creating space for other actors (like China or Russia) to increase influence without conditions related to democracy or environment. Gabon might have perceived the U.S. as an unreliable partner on its key priority of conservation finance.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, the U.S. should **re-center the partnership around shared environmental leadership**, strongly reaffirming support for Gabon's conservation efforts with multi-year funding commitments. Immediately re-engage diplomatically to support the democratic transition process based on clear benchmarks.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Gabon Green Economy Partnership"** focused on sustainable development:
    - **Conservation Finance:** Provide technical assistance to help Gabon access international carbon markets and climate funds (e.g., REDD+, Green Climate Fund). Support Gabon's efforts within CAFI. Fund anti-poaching and sustainable forest management programs via USFWS/USAID.
    - **Sustainable Agriculture/Fisheries:** Support development of sustainable cocoa, coffee, or non-timber forest product value chains. Provide technical assistance for sustainable fisheries management to reduce reliance on imports and protect marine biodiversity. Fund relevant research and capacity building at Gabonese institutions.
    - **Eco-Tourism Development:** Offer expertise (e.g., via National Park Service exchanges) and potentially DFC financing for developing Gabon's eco-tourism infrastructure sustainably, creating jobs while supporting conservation.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Gabon Environmental and Economic Dialogue** to coordinate these efforts, monitor progress (e.g., forest cover maintained, carbon credits sold, jobs created in green sectors), and ensure accountability.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. commitment to Gabon's environment and democratic future. Expand exchanges focused on conservation, environmental science, and democratic governance (e.g., YALI, university partnerships).

## 4. Policy Goals

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

- **Past and present contributions:** Global leader in rainforest/marine conservation; relative political stability historically; cooperation on Gulf of Guinea maritime security; participation in regional bodies (ECCAS).
- **What we would like in the future:** Successful transition back to democracy (serving as positive regional example); continued environmental leadership (Congo Basin protection, climate action); enhanced maritime security cooperation; constructive role in ECCAS promoting regional stability.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

- **Needs:** Support for credible democratic transition (diplomatic, technical, financial); assistance for economic diversification (away from oil); sustained funding/support for conservation efforts; access to climate finance/carbon markets; technical assistance for governance/transparency (especially resource management).

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

- Implement a **"Conditional Re-engagement Strategy"** tied to democratic transition progress:
    1.  **Support Democratic Transition:** Maintain diplomatic engagement with transitional authorities; provide technical support for electoral process (via UN/AU/ECCAS); condition full resumption of aid/cooperation on credible elections and return to constitutional rule.
    2.  **Sustain Environmental Partnership:** Continue vital conservation funding (parks, anti-poaching) through NGOs and international mechanisms, insulating it from political restrictions where possible. Help Gabon access climate/carbon finance.
    3.  **Promote Economic Diversification:** Offer technical assistance for non-oil sector development (agriculture, tourism, fisheries); support governance reforms (EITI, anti-corruption) to improve investment climate post-transition.
    4.  **Maintain Security Dialogue:** Keep channels open on maritime security, potentially resuming limited cooperation if transition progresses positively.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

- **Facilitate a swift and credible return to democratic, constitutional rule** in Gabon.
- **Preserve and support Gabon's global leadership role in environmental conservation**.
- **Maintain Gabon as a partner for maritime security** in the Gulf of Guinea post-transition.
- **Encourage Gabon to play a constructive role** within ECCAS and the AU once its membership is restored.

**Economic Strategies:**

- **Use phased resumption of economic assistance** as leverage for democratic progress.
- **Support Gabon's efforts to diversify its economy** sustainably, focusing on green sectors.
- **Promote transparency in natural resource management** (oil, manganese, timber).
- **Encourage responsible foreign investment** post-transition by supporting improvements in governance and the business climate.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**

- **Assessment:** Gabon has a relatively better-funded health system than some neighbors due to oil wealth, but access and quality vary. Faces challenges with infectious diseases (malaria, HIV) and growing NCDs. Pandemic preparedness capacity is limited.
- **Opportunities:** Provide technical assistance via CDC/USAID for disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and health information systems. Support primary healthcare strengthening. Partner on research (e.g., zoonotic diseases linked to forests).
- **U.S. Wants:** Improved disease surveillance; cooperation on regional health security.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Frame cooperation around shared health security; offer technical expertise; leverage existing regional health networks.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**

- **Evaluation:** Gabon hosts some migrants/refugees from the region but is not a major host country. Border management focuses on resource control (timber, smuggling) and migration.
- **Impact:** Limited direct impact on U.S. interests related to migration from Gabon.
- **Response:** Focus cooperation on **transnational crime** aspects of border management (anti-trafficking, anti-smuggling) rather than migration control per se. Support ECCAS efforts on regional free movement protocols if aligned with security needs.
- **U.S. Wants:** Cooperation against illicit trafficking across borders.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Offer targeted training/equipment for customs and border police focused on counter-trafficking/smuggling, conditional on democratic transition progress.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**

- **Assessment:** Corruption perceived as high, particularly linked to Bongo family and resource wealth. Weak institutions, lack of transparency. Coup leaders pledged to fight graft.
- **Measures:** Strongly encourage the transitional government to implement promised anti-corruption measures and asset declarations. Support Gabon's potential accession to EITI. Provide technical assistance for public financial management reform and capacity building for audit institutions, conditional on transition progress.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**

- **Analysis:** Gabon values its role in ECCAS, AU, OPEC, and environmental forums. Membership suspension post-coup impacts its influence.
- **Leverage:** Encourage transitional government to meet AU/ECCAS requirements for restoration of membership. Support Gabon's constructive role in these bodies post-transition, particularly on regional security and environmental issues.

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**

- **Issues:** Pre-coup: limits on political freedoms, inequality. Post-coup: uncertainty regarding respect for rights during transition. Potential for discrimination against minorities or migrant workers.
- **Influence:** Press transitional government to respect fundamental freedoms (speech, assembly) during transition. Support Gabonese civil society monitoring human rights. Ensure U.S. programs promote inclusivity and benefit marginalized groups.

**Technology & Cyber Cooperation:**

- **Needs:** Develop basic cybersecurity capacity and digital infrastructure.
- **Opportunities:** Post-transition, offer basic cybersecurity awareness training. Support digital literacy. U.S. tech firms could potentially invest in Gabon's small but growing ICT sector if governance improves.
- **U.S. Wants:** Prevent Gabon from becoming a source of cyber instability; basic cooperation on cybercrime.

**Energy Transition & Green Finance:**

- **Roadmap:** Gabon needs to manage declining oil output while investing oil revenues in sustainable diversification. Potential for solar energy is high. Accessing green finance for conservation and renewables is key.
- **Opportunities:** Provide technical assistance for renewable energy policy/regulation. Help Gabon structure deals to attract private investment in solar. Facilitate access to Green Climate Fund and carbon markets (support for REDD+).
- **Metrics:** Growth in non-oil revenue, investment in renewable energy capacity, successful carbon credit transactions.

**Education & Workforce Development:**

- **Status:** Education system needs quality improvements. Skills mismatch with potential diversification sectors (tourism, agriculture, tech).
- **Initiatives:** Post-transition, offer scholarships (Fulbright, YALI) focused on environmental management, governance, and diversification sectors. Support vocational training programs aligned with green economy needs. Fund university partnerships in conservation science or sustainable resource management.
- **Outcomes:** Increased pool of skilled Gabonese professionals for conservation and diversified economy.

**Health Beyond Pandemics (Noncommunicable Diseases):**

- **Burden:** Increasing NCD burden alongside infectious diseases.
- **Collaboration:** Support integration of NCD prevention/care into health system strengthening efforts. Partner on health education campaigns.

**Rule of Law & Judiciary Reform:**

- **Status:** Weak judiciary, historically influenced by executive. Needs strengthening post-transition.
- **Assistance:** Offer technical assistance for constitutional/legal reforms during transition. Support training for judges/lawyers focused on commercial law, environmental law, human rights.
- **Benchmarks:** Adoption of constitutional/legal reforms strengthening judicial independence, establishment of transparent judicial appointment processes.

**Supply‑Chain Resilience:**

- **Industries:** Gabon is important for manganese supply. Timber supply chains need sustainability focus. Not a major node for complex U.S. supply chains otherwise.
- **Incentives:** Focus on ensuring sustainable and transparent extraction/export of existing resources (manganese, timber). Support diversification into areas that could eventually contribute to resilient supply chains (e.g., sustainable agriculture).

**Diaspora & Remittance Flows:**

- **Diaspora:** Small Gabonese diaspora in U.S./Europe. Remittances not a major economic factor.
- **Engagement:** Engage diaspora professionals for expertise in transition/development efforts. Facilitate cultural ties.

**Cultural Heritage & Soft Power:**

- **Assets:** Unique biodiversity, national parks, traditional cultures.
- **Programs:** Continue support for national parks and biodiversity research. Fund cultural exchanges (artists, musicians). Use public diplomacy to highlight U.S. support for Gabon's environment and democratic aspirations.

**Tariff Report:**

- Gabon is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the **African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)**. However, its eligibility is subject to review based on statutory criteria, including progress towards democracy and human rights. The 2023 coup puts its AGOA eligibility at risk if democratic transition falters. Outside of AGOA, standard U.S. tariffs apply. Gabon is not part of any free trade agreement with the U.S.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- Immigration from Gabon to the U.S. is very low. Small numbers arrive as students, through employment visas (often related to international organizations or oil sector), or via the Diversity Visa lottery. There is no significant Gabonese refugee or asylum-seeker population in the U.S.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens **require a visa** to enter Gabon. Visas must generally be obtained in advance from a Gabonese embassy or consulate. Gabon introduced an e-visa system, but its reliability and current status post-coup should be verified. Requirements typically include a valid passport, photo, proof of accommodation/invitation, yellow fever vaccination certificate, and fee. Visa policies may be subject to change during the political transition.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Human rights protections were limited under the Bongo regime, and the current situation under military transition is uncertain. Constitutional guarantees are suspended.
- **Affected Groups:** Political opposition figures, journalists, and civil society activists faced restrictions pre-coup and remain vulnerable. Concerns exist about potential for arbitrary detention during the transition. Economic inequality affects large parts of the population.
- **Suppressed Rights:** Freedom of speech, press, and assembly were restricted pre-coup and remain precarious. Lack of judicial independence and corruption undermine rule of law. Electoral rights were systematically violated in past elections.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Publicly and privately urge the transitional government to respect fundamental human rights during the transition period. Call for release of any political detainees. Condition the lifting of aid restrictions and full re-engagement on measurable progress towards restoring constitutional rights and holding credible elections. Support Gabonese civil society efforts to monitor the transition and advocate for rights. Ensure any future U.S. assistance incorporates human rights conditionality and monitoring.
