# **Ghana: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Ghana share a strong and enduring partnership based on shared democratic values, significant economic ties, and cooperation on regional security. Ghana is widely regarded as one of West Africa's most stable democracies and a key U.S. partner in promoting peace, security, and good governance in a region facing significant challenges from democratic backsliding and violent extremism. The relationship is characterized by robust development assistance through USAID, health cooperation via PEPFAR and PMI (President's Malaria Initiative), strong trade links facilitated by AGOA, and growing security cooperation focused on maritime security and counterterrorism preparedness. Current relations are **excellent and collaborative**, marked by frequent high-level visits (including Vice President Kamala Harris in 2023), joint military exercises, support for Ghana's role in ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), and alignment on many international issues. The U.S. views Ghana as a democratic anchor and a vital partner in advancing shared goals for a stable, prosperous, and democratic West Africa.

### **Crises**

Ghana is currently facing a severe **economic crisis**, its worst in decades. The country defaulted on most of its external debt in late 2022 and is undergoing a major debt restructuring process under a $3 billion IMF Extended Credit Facility program agreed upon in 2023. The crisis was triggered by unsustainable borrowing, large fiscal deficits exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine (which drove up food and fuel import costs), and a sharp depreciation of the currency (the cedi). This has led to very high inflation (peaking over 50% in 2022), increased cost of living, and social hardship, prompting protests against government austerity measures implemented under the IMF program. Restoring macroeconomic stability, managing the complex debt restructuring (involving negotiations with bilateral creditors like China and private bondholders), and mitigating the social impact of the crisis are Ghana's most pressing challenges.

Regionally, Ghana is situated in a neighborhood facing significant **security and political crises**. The spread of violent extremism (linked to affiliates of ISIS and al-Qaeda) southward from the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) poses a direct threat to coastal West African states, including Ghana. While Ghana itself has not experienced major terrorist attacks, concerns about potential spillover, recruitment, and infiltration are high. Ghana actively participates in regional counterterrorism efforts like the Accra Initiative. Furthermore, the region has witnessed a spate of **military coups** (Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger), leading to democratic backsliding and straining regional bodies like ECOWAS, where Ghana plays a leading diplomatic role advocating for constitutional rule. Managing the security threat from the north and navigating the complex regional political landscape are major challenges.

While Ghana itself is politically stable, the upcoming **general elections in December 2024** present a potential flashpoint, as Ghanaian elections are often closely contested and can involve heightened tensions, although transfers of power have historically been peaceful. Ensuring a peaceful and credible election amidst the economic crisis will be crucial for maintaining stability. Additionally, **maritime insecurity** in the Gulf of Guinea, including piracy and illegal fishing, remains a persistent regional challenge affecting Ghana's coastal areas and trade routes.

Anticipated future crises include the potential for **social unrest** if the economic crisis deepens or austerity measures become unbearable. Worsening **climate change impacts** (sea-level rise along the coast, changing rainfall patterns affecting cocoa production) pose long-term risks. The **regional security situation** in the Sahel could deteriorate further, increasing pressure on Ghana's northern borders. Failure to successfully complete the debt restructuring could lead to prolonged economic stagnation and potential political instability.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Ghana has consistently been a vital partner for the U.S. in promoting stability, democracy, and security in West Africa. Its most significant contribution lies in its role as a **democratic anchor and model** in a region often troubled by instability and authoritarianism. Ghana's history of peaceful transfers of power through credible elections (since 1992) serves as a powerful example and reinforces U.S. goals of supporting democratic governance. Ghana actively champions democracy regionally through **ECOWAS**, often taking principled stances against coups and unconstitutional changes of government, aligning closely with U.S. policy. For instance, Ghana played a key role in ECOWAS responses to coups in Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso, advocating for transitions back to civilian rule. In **regional security**, Ghana is a crucial partner. It contributes troops consistently to **UN peacekeeping missions** globally (historically one of the top contributors worldwide) and regionally (e.g., in Liberia, Sierra Leone previously, and potentially future ECOWAS missions). Ghana hosts U.S. security cooperation activities and joint exercises (like Flintlock), enhancing regional capacity to address threats. It is a key member of the **Accra Initiative**, a regional security framework established in 2017 by coastal West African states (Ghana, Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Togo) to combat the spillover of terrorism from the Sahel, sharing intelligence and coordinating border security operations – directly supporting U.S. counterterrorism objectives. Ghana also cooperates on **maritime security** in the Gulf of Guinea, working with the U.S. and regional partners to combat piracy and illegal fishing. Economically, Ghana's relative stability and open market policies have made it a hub for regional trade and a key destination for U.S. investment in West Africa, supporting U.S. goals of promoting economic growth and integration.

Looking ahead, the U.S. seeks Ghana's continued and enhanced leadership. Firstly, maintaining its own **democratic resilience**, particularly through peaceful and credible elections in 2024, is paramount as a regional example. The U.S. wants Ghana to continue its strong **diplomatic leadership within ECOWAS** to address regional challenges, including pushing for democratic transitions in coup-affected countries and coordinating responses to the Sahel security crisis. Concrete actions could involve Ghana hosting dialogues between Sahelian juntas and ECOWAS or championing reforms within ECOWAS to make it more effective. Secondly, Ghana's role in the **Accra Initiative** and regional counterterrorism efforts needs strengthening. The U.S. would like to see enhanced intelligence sharing, joint border patrols with neighbors (especially Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Burkina Faso), and proactive measures to counter extremist recruitment in northern Ghana. U.S. security assistance can support this, with benchmarks focused on operational tempo and intelligence fusion. Thirdly, Ghana can be a leader in promoting **maritime security**. Enhanced participation in the Yaoundé Architecture, investment in its navy/coast guard capabilities (potentially with U.S. support), and leading regional efforts against illegal fishing would significantly aid U.S. goals. Fourthly, successful implementation of its **IMF program and economic reforms** would not only stabilize Ghana but also serve as a positive example for other indebted countries in the region. The U.S. wants Ghana to demonstrate that democratic governance can deliver economic stability and reform. Accountability could involve regular U.S.-Ghana strategic dialogues reviewing progress on regional security cooperation, democratic consolidation, and economic reforms, potentially linking levels of assistance to performance on shared objectives.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Ghana requires significant international support, including from the U.S., to navigate its current economic crisis and sustain its role as a democratic and security anchor. The most immediate need is support for its **economic stabilization and debt restructuring efforts**. This includes continued U.S. backing for Ghana's **IMF program**, diplomatic support in negotiations with bilateral creditors (including China, a major creditor) and private bondholders to achieve a sustainable debt resolution, and potentially bridging finance or guarantees from multilateral development banks (World Bank, AfDB) where the U.S. holds significant influence. Technical assistance from the U.S. Treasury and USAID in areas like public financial management, domestic revenue mobilization, and debt management capacity is crucial for long-term fiscal health. Benchmarks for success include meeting IMF program targets, successfully completing debt restructuring agreements, and restoring market access.

Ghana needs support to **mitigate the social impact of the economic crisis and austerity measures**. U.S. development assistance through USAID should prioritize programs that protect vulnerable populations, such as strengthening social safety nets, supporting food security initiatives (e.g., through Feed the Future), and maintaining funding for essential health and education services. Continued robust funding for **health programs**, particularly PEPFAR (HIV/AIDS), PMI (malaria), and maternal/child health initiatives, is vital to preserve hard-won gains. Institutional partners include Ghanaian ministries (Finance, Health, Gender & Social Protection) and civil society organizations delivering services. Success would be measured by maintained or improved social indicators despite the crisis.

To address regional security threats, Ghana needs enhanced **security and counterterrorism assistance**. This includes U.S. support (funding, equipment, training) for the Ghana Armed Forces and police units focused on northern border security, intelligence gathering/analysis (ISR capabilities), and participation in regional initiatives like the Accra Initiative. Support for **maritime security** capabilities (patrol boats, radar systems, training) to combat piracy and illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea is also needed. Assistance should continue to be vetted for human rights compliance (Leahy Law) and include components on civilian protection and security sector governance. Benchmarks could include improved border interdiction rates and enhanced maritime domain awareness.

Ghana requires support for **strengthening its democratic institutions and processes**, particularly ahead of the 2024 elections. U.S. assistance (via USAID and NGOs like NDI/IRI) can support the Electoral Commission of Ghana, promote election security, fund domestic election observation groups, support media capacity building for responsible election reporting, and facilitate dialogue among political parties to prevent conflict. Continued support for Ghanaian civil society organizations working on anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability is also essential for democratic health. Success metrics include peaceful and credible elections and improvements in governance indicators. Finally, Ghana needs support for **climate change adaptation**, particularly for coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and northern regions affected by drought and desertification. U.S. assistance can fund climate-resilient agriculture projects, coastal adaptation measures, renewable energy development (Ghana has solar potential), and capacity building for climate policy planning. Collaboration through international climate funds and bilateral programs is needed, measuring success through implemented adaptation projects and progress on Ghana's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S. is a major trading partner. Bilateral trade totals around **$1.5 - $2 billion** annually. Ghana exports cocoa, oil, gold, apparel (under AGOA), and cashews to the U.S. U.S. exports vehicles, machinery, poultry, plastics, and wheat.
  - Ghana's other major trade partners include China, India, Switzerland (gold exports), and the EU.
  - U.S. is a significant source of FDI, particularly in the energy, mining, and ICT sectors. Ghana hosts numerous U.S. companies. Chinese investment is also substantial, mainly in infrastructure.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Ghana is a major global producer of **cocoa** and **gold**. It also produces **oil** (offshore fields discovered 2007), contributing to government revenue but also exposing it to price volatility. It has potential for bauxite and other minerals.
  - Ghana plays a key role in **ECOWAS**, promoting regional economic integration. It hosts the secretariat of the **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)** in Accra, positioning itself as a hub for intra-African trade, which aligns with U.S. goals of supporting AfCFTA. Its ports (Tema, Takoradi) are important regional trade gateways.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - **Spillover of violent extremism** from the Sahel (Burkina Faso) into northern Ghana is the primary shared security threat.
  - **Maritime insecurity** in the Gulf of Guinea (piracy, illegal fishing, smuggling).
  - Transnational organized crime (narcotics trafficking, cybercrime).
  - Regional instability caused by coups and conflicts in neighboring countries. Internal risks include potential election-related tensions and localized chieftaincy or land disputes.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - Strong U.S.-Ghana military cooperation: U.S. provides training (IMET, peacekeeping operations training at Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre - KAIPTC in Accra), equipment, and advisory support to Ghana Armed Forces (GAF). Regular joint exercises (Flintlock, Obangame Express). Strong intelligence sharing on counterterrorism.
  - Ghana is a key partner in the **Accra Initiative**. It is a major troop contributor to UN peacekeeping. It participates actively in ECOWAS security mechanisms.
  - Future cooperation focuses on enhancing GAF capacity for counterterrorism operations in the north, improving maritime domain awareness, cybersecurity defense, and supporting KAIPTC as a regional center of excellence for peacekeeping and security studies.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Ghana is a respected diplomatic voice in West Africa and globally, known for its commitment to democracy, peace, and multilateralism. It plays a leading role in **ECOWAS**, often chairing the body or mediating crises. It actively participates in the **African Union** and the **Commonwealth**.
  - It frequently serves as a non-permanent member of the **UN Security Council**, advocating for African perspectives. It hosts the AfCFTA Secretariat.
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - High potential. U.S. often coordinates with Ghana on ECOWAS strategies regarding regional crises (coups, security). Ghana's credibility makes it an effective partner in promoting democratic norms and mediating conflicts. Supporting Ghana's diplomatic capacity and initiatives within ECOWAS and the AU is a key U.S. strategy.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Ghana has strong democratic institutions but faces challenges. Corruption remains a significant public concern. Occasional concerns about police conduct, prison conditions, and delays in the justice system. LGBTQ+ rights are restricted (same-sex relations criminalized, recent passage of restrictive anti-LGBTQ+ bill facing legal challenges and international criticism).
  - U.S. engages on these issues through diplomatic channels and support for Ghanaian institutions (judiciary, anti-corruption bodies) and civil society. The anti-LGBTQ+ bill has drawn significant U.S. concern and could impact aid/investment if fully implemented.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Political system is stable with established democratic norms for transitions. The upcoming 2024 election is expected to be competitive. Policy continuity on foreign policy and security is high, but economic policy is constrained by the IMF program and debt crisis.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - African Union (AU)
  - ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)
  - Commonwealth of Nations
  - African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (Ghana hosts secretariat)
  - AGOA eligibility
  - PEPFAR Partnership Framework
  - Power Africa / MCC Compacts (past)
  - Defense Cooperation Agreements (including SOFA)
  - Open Skies Agreement
  - Various international conventions (climate, biodiversity, chemical weapons, etc.)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - The overriding concern is Ghana's **debt crisis** and the need for successful restructuring and IMF program implementation. No major U.S. sanctions. Ghana seeks continued preferential access under AGOA and potentially enhanced market access through future agreements. Corruption can be a barrier for investors.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Opportunities exist to support Ghana's economic recovery and diversification. This includes U.S. support for successful debt restructuring, promoting U.S. investment (DFC, Prosper Africa) in sectors like agribusiness, ICT, renewable energy, and manufacturing. Supporting Ghana's role as the AfCFTA host can facilitate broader U.S. commercial engagement with the continent. While a full FTA is not currently pursued, sectoral cooperation or a STIP-like framework could be explored post-crisis.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Instability and extremism in the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) directly impact Ghana's security and shape U.S.-Ghana cooperation. Political crises (coups) in neighboring countries test Ghana's diplomatic role within ECOWAS. Ghana maintains balanced relations with major powers (U.S., China, Europe).
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - **Terrorism spillover** from Sahel is the primary risk. Cybersecurity capacity needs enhancement. Low risk of direct military escalation involving Ghana, but regional instability poses indirect risks. Potential for election-related tensions requires monitoring.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Significant Ghanaian diaspora in U.S./Europe contributes remittances. Strong educational ties (many Ghanaians study in U.S., active Fulbright/YALI programs). U.S. culture is popular. Public opinion towards U.S. is generally very positive.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Strong shared commitment to democratic values, rule of law, free press. Generally aligned on importance of education, entrepreneurship. Divergence on social issues like LGBTQ+ rights reflects conservative social norms in Ghana. Strong Christian presence, significant Muslim minority in the north.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Ghana vulnerable to sea-level rise (coastal erosion), changing rainfall affecting agriculture (especially cocoa), and potential water stress in the north. Illegal mining ("galamsey") causes significant environmental degradation (water pollution, deforestation). U.S. interest in regional stability, food security, and supporting Ghana's climate commitments.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Support Ghana's transition to renewable energy (solar potential is high). Collaborate on climate-smart agriculture (cocoa sector). Provide technical assistance for coastal adaptation and sustainable land management. Support efforts to combat illegal mining and deforestation.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Climate change can exacerbate farmer-herder conflicts in the north. Coastal erosion threatens communities and infrastructure. Water pollution from illegal mining affects health and livelihoods.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have continued security cooperation given shared CT interests but could have reduced development aid, health funding, and democracy support, viewing Ghana more transactionally. Skepticism towards multilateralism might have weakened support for ECOWAS or AfCFTA.
- Trade relations could have become unpredictable, potentially questioning AGOA benefits or imposing tariffs. Climate change cooperation would likely have ceased.
- Impact could have been reduced U.S. soft power, potentially straining relations if aid was cut significantly, and undermining long-term development goals. Ghana might have sought stronger ties elsewhere. However, the core security partnership might have endured due to mutual interest in regional stability.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, the U.S. should **reaffirm the partnership based on shared democratic values**, restore funding for development/health/democracy programs, and re-engage strongly on climate change. Fully support Ghana's role in ECOWAS and AfCFTA.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Ghana Agricultural Modernization and Resilience Program"**:
    - **Climate-Smart Agriculture:** Provide technical assistance (USAID, USDA) and finance (DFC) for adoption of drought-resistant cocoa varieties, improved irrigation, and sustainable land management practices. Support research at Ghanaian agricultural institutions (e.g., Cocoa Research Institute).
    - **Value Chain Development:** Support farmer cooperatives, improve post-harvest storage/processing, and facilitate access to finance and markets (including U.S. buyers) for cocoa, cashews, shea, and other key crops. Promote fair trade certifications.
    - **Youth in Agriculture:** Fund programs encouraging youth participation in modern agribusiness through training, mentorship, and access to start-up capital.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Ghana Agricultural Dialogue** to coordinate these efforts, monitor progress (e.g., cocoa yields, farmer incomes, adoption of climate-smart practices), and ensure alignment with Ghana's national agricultural strategy.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. support for Ghana's farmers and economic recovery. Expand agricultural exchanges and YALI programs focused on agribusiness leadership.

- **Programs:** Support preservation of historical sites. Fund cultural exchanges (musicians, artists, writers). Support Ghanaian creative industries. Use public diplomacy (embassy programs, VOA) to highlight shared democratic values and partnership.

**Tariff Report:**

- Ghana benefits significantly from duty-free access to the U.S. market for thousands of products under the **African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)**. Key exports under AGOA include apparel, cocoa products, and cashews. Standard U.S. tariffs apply to non-AGOA eligible goods. There are no specific punitive U.S. tariffs on Ghana.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- There is a large and well-established Ghanaian diaspora in the U.S., estimated at **over 200,000** (including U.S.-born). Immigration occurs through family reunification, employment visas, the Diversity Visa lottery (Ghana is a major participating country), and student visas. Ghana is not a significant source of asylum seekers.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens **require a visa** to enter Ghana. Visas must generally be obtained in advance from a Ghanaian embassy or consulate. Options include single or multiple-entry visas for tourism or business. Requirements typically include a valid passport, application form, photo, proof of travel itinerary/invitation, yellow fever vaccination certificate, and fee (around $60-$100 depending on type/duration). Processing times vary. Ghana does not typically offer visa-on-arrival for U.S. citizens.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Ghana has strong constitutional protections and a relatively good human rights record for the region, with active civil society and independent media. However, challenges remain.
- **Affected Groups:** Concerns include occasional police brutality, poor prison conditions, societal discrimination and legal restrictions against LGBTQ+ individuals, and inadequate protection for persons accused of witchcraft in some communities. Rights of journalists and protestors are generally respected but sometimes face pressure.
- **Suppressed Rights:** The primary legal suppression concerns LGBTQ+ rights (same-sex conduct criminalized, recent passage of a highly restrictive anti-LGBTQ+ bill currently facing legal challenge). Freedom of assembly is sometimes restricted during sensitive protests. Access to justice can be slow.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Engage Ghanaian government consistently on human rights concerns, particularly the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, emphasizing its negative impact on human dignity, public health (HIV access), and the investment climate. Support Ghanaian institutions (CHRAJ, judiciary) and civil society working on human rights, accountability, and rule of law. Continue human rights vetting for security assistance. Support independent media. Use public diplomacy to champion universal values while respecting Ghanaian sovereignty.
