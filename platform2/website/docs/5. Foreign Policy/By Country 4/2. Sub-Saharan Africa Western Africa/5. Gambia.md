# **The Gambia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and The Republic of The Gambia share a relationship revitalized since The Gambia's remarkable democratic transition in 2017, which ended over two decades of authoritarian rule under Yahya Jammeh. The U.S. strongly supported this transition and has since become a key partner in helping The Gambia consolidate its democracy, strengthen governance, address legacies of past human rights abuses, and promote sustainable economic development. Current relations are **positive and focused on supporting democratic consolidation and development**, characterized by U.S. assistance programs aimed at strengthening institutions, promoting justice and reconciliation, improving health and education, and fostering economic growth. The U.S. views The Gambia as an important example of democratic progress in West Africa and supports its efforts to play a constructive role in regional affairs through ECOWAS.

### **Crises**

The Gambia faces several significant challenges, though perhaps not acute, immediate crises in the same way as some neighbors. The primary ongoing challenge is **consolidating its democratic transition and addressing the legacy of the Jammeh era**. This includes implementing recommendations from the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), ensuring accountability for past human rights abuses, reforming the security sector (which was deeply politicized under Jammeh), and strengthening democratic institutions (judiciary, electoral commission, parliament) to prevent democratic backsliding. Failure to effectively manage this transitional justice and institutional reform process could undermine public trust and long-term stability.

Economically, The Gambia faces **significant development challenges**. It remains a Least Developed Country (LDC) with high rates of poverty, youth unemployment, and vulnerability to external shocks. The economy is heavily reliant on tourism (impacted by COVID-19), agriculture (vulnerable to climate change), and remittances. Diversifying the economy, creating jobs, and improving public services are critical needs. While not in an acute debt crisis like Ghana, managing public finances prudently and attracting investment remain key challenges.

Regionally, The Gambia is geographically unique, almost entirely surrounded by Senegal, with a small Atlantic coastline. Its stability is closely linked to that of **Senegal** and the broader West African region. While not directly bordering the Sahelian conflict zones, regional instability, including democratic backsliding in nearby countries (Guinea, Mali) and potential spillover effects from transnational organized crime (trafficking), pose indirect risks. Ensuring continued stability and democratic progress in The Gambia contributes positively to the regional landscape.

Anticipated future crises could include **political tensions** if transitional justice processes stall or are perceived as unfair, or if future elections become highly contentious. **Economic shocks** (e.g., poor tourist seasons, climate impacts on agriculture) could exacerbate poverty and social pressures. **Climate change impacts**, particularly sea-level rise affecting the coastal capital Banjul and changing rainfall patterns impacting agriculture, pose significant long-term risks to this low-lying nation. Youth unemployment, if unaddressed, could also become a source of future instability or drive irregular migration.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

The Gambia, despite its small size, can significantly contribute to U.S. regional goals in West Africa, primarily by serving as a **positive model of democratic transition and consolidation**. Its successful shift from authoritarianism in 2017 provides a powerful counter-narrative to democratic backsliding elsewhere in the region. By strengthening its own democratic institutions, upholding human rights, and implementing transitional justice mechanisms effectively (including accountability for Jammeh-era crimes), The Gambia reinforces U.S. objectives of promoting democracy and good governance across West Africa. Historically, since the transition, The Gambia has actively re-engaged with regional and international partners, including the U.S. It has participated constructively in **ECOWAS**, supporting regional efforts towards peace and democracy. Gambian forces have also resumed contributions to **UN peacekeeping operations** (e.g., in Darfur historically, potentially others in future), supporting global peace and security efforts aligned with U.S. interests. The Gambia has also cooperated with the U.S. and international partners on **countering transnational crime**, including efforts against drug trafficking transiting the region.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks The Gambia's continued commitment to **democratic consolidation**. Successfully implementing the TRRC recommendations, including potential prosecutions for past abuses, and completing security sector reform would solidify its democratic gains and serve as a powerful regional example. The U.S. wants The Gambia to remain an **active and constructive voice within ECOWAS**, advocating for democratic norms, constitutional rule, and peaceful conflict resolution in the region. Concrete actions could include The Gambia sharing its transitional justice experiences with other nations or taking principled stances within ECOWAS against unconstitutional changes of government. Continued cooperation on **transnational threats** is also important. The U.S. seeks enhanced Gambian efforts, supported by U.S. capacity building, to combat drug trafficking, human smuggling, and illegal fishing within its waters and territory. Benchmarks could include successful prosecutions related to TRRC findings, completion of key security sector reforms, active participation in ECOWAS initiatives, and measurable improvements in interdicting illicit flows. Accountability can be maintained through regular U.S.-Gambia bilateral dialogues (like the existing Partnership Dialogue) and monitoring progress on U.S. assistance program goals related to democracy, governance, and security.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a small LDC undergoing a complex democratic transition, The Gambia requires substantial and sustained support from the U.S. and the international community. A primary need is **assistance for democratic consolidation and governance reform**. This includes technical and financial support for implementing **transitional justice** processes (TRRC recommendations, potential special court mechanisms), **security sector reform** (professionalizing police and military, establishing civilian oversight), strengthening the **judiciary** and **electoral institutions**, and supporting **parliamentary capacity**. U.S. assistance via USAID, State Department (INL, DRL bureaus), and potentially MCC (if eligibility criteria are met) is crucial. Institutional partners include the Gambian Ministry of Justice, security agencies, judiciary, National Assembly, and civil society organizations. Benchmarks include progress on TRRC implementation, adoption of key reform legislation, and successful conduct of future electoral cycles.

The Gambia urgently needs support for **sustainable economic development and poverty reduction**. Assistance should focus on diversifying the economy beyond tourism and rain-fed agriculture. This includes supporting **agricultural productivity** and climate resilience (e.g., through Feed the Future), developing **fisheries** sustainably, promoting **SME growth** and access to finance, investing in **vocational training** to address youth unemployment, and improving basic infrastructure (energy, water, sanitation). U.S. support via USAID, DFC (for private sector investment), and advocacy within the World Bank/AfDB for concessional financing is vital. Continued access to preferential trade programs like **AGOA** is important for nascent export sectors. Success metrics include poverty reduction rates, youth employment figures, and growth in non-traditional exports.

Strengthening **human capital** through investments in health and education is another critical need. Continued U.S. support for **health systems** (maternal/child health, malaria prevention via PMI, potentially future PEPFAR engagement if needed) and **basic education** (improving quality, access, especially for girls) is essential. Partnerships with Gambian ministries, local NGOs, and international organizations (UNICEF, WHO) are key. Benchmarks include improvements in health indicators (infant mortality, malaria prevalence) and educational outcomes (literacy rates, school completion).

The Gambia also requires assistance in **climate change adaptation**. As a low-lying coastal nation, it needs support for coastal protection measures, climate-resilient agriculture and fisheries, and developing renewable energy sources (solar potential). Access to international climate finance (Green Climate Fund) and technical expertise (e.g., from NOAA, USGS) is needed. Finally, The Gambia needs continued **diplomatic support** for its democratic path and constructive regional role. U.S. advocacy within international forums and consistent high-level engagement reinforces The Gambia's reform efforts and international standing.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Republic of The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, located in West Africa. It is a narrow strip of land surrounding the Gambia River, almost entirely enveloped by Senegal, except for a short Atlantic coastline. Population is around **2.7 million** (2023 estimate).
- The Gambia is a **republic with a presidential system**. It underwent a significant democratic transition in 2017 after 22 years of authoritarian rule.
- Economically, The Gambia is classified as a **Least Developed Country (LDC)**. GDP is approximately **$2.2 billion**. GDP per capita is very low, around **$800**. The economy relies heavily on tourism, agriculture (especially groundnuts), and remittances from Gambians abroad. Poverty is widespread.
- Quality of life indicators are low. Life expectancy is around **67 years**. Access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation is limited, particularly in rural areas.
- Freedom House ranks The Gambia as **“Partly Free”** (score typically around 60-65/100), reflecting significant improvements since 2017 but ongoing challenges in consolidating democratic institutions, rule of law, and addressing past abuses.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- The Gambia's primary importance to U.S. interests lies in its status as a **successful democratic transition** in a region facing democratic backsliding. Supporting its success serves as a positive model.
- Its location makes its stability relevant to **Senegal's security** (a key U.S. partner).
- Cooperation on **transnational crime** (counter-narcotics) and potentially **maritime security** (illegal fishing) is valuable.
- It contributes troops to **UN peacekeeping**.
- It is a recipient of U.S. **development and democracy assistance**.

**Democracy Score:**

- The Gambia transitioned to democracy in 2017 after President Adama Barrow defeated longtime dictator Yahya Jammeh in elections, with ECOWAS intervention ensuring Jammeh's departure. Since then, democratic space has opened significantly, with increased media freedom, civil society activity, and more competitive elections (Barrow re-elected 2021).
- However, challenges remain in strengthening institutions, implementing transitional justice (TRRC report submitted 2021, government white paper accepted most recommendations 2022, implementation ongoing), security sector reform, and addressing corruption.
- The current President is **Adama Barrow**, originally elected as head of an opposition coalition, now leading his own National People's Party (NPP) in coalition with other parties.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - **1965:** The Gambia gains independence from the UK; U.S. establishes relations. Generally positive relations under first President Dawda Jawara.
  - **1994:** Military coup brings Yahya Jammeh to power. Relations deteriorate significantly over the next 22 years due to Jammeh's authoritarian rule, human rights abuses, and erratic policies. U.S. suspends some aid and imposes visa restrictions.
  - **Dec 2016 - Jan 2017:** Jammeh refuses to concede defeat after election loss to Adama Barrow. ECOWAS intervenes militarily (ECOMIG, led by Senegal) with strong U.S./international diplomatic backing, forcing Jammeh into exile.
  - **Post-2017:** Democratic transition under President Barrow. U.S. strongly supports transition, restores aid (including eligibility for MCC threshold program), and significantly deepens engagement across democracy, governance, justice, security sector reform, and development.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - No direct conflicts. Relationship defined by sharp contrast between Jammeh era (strained ties, limited cooperation) and post-Jammeh era (strong partnership focused on supporting democracy).
  - Key agreements/partnerships post-2017 include USAID development assistance programs, State Department support for transitional justice/SSR, MCC threshold program focused on energy/governance, Peace Corps program resumed, cooperation on counter-narcotics. The Gambia benefits from AGOA.
  - Bilateral relations are currently **very positive and cooperative**, centered on U.S. support for The Gambia's democratic journey and development aspirations.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Gambia trade is minimal, less than **$50 million** annually. U.S. exports include vehicles, machinery, poultry, rice. U.S. imports are negligible, mainly some agricultural products or handicrafts.
  - The Gambia's main trading partners are Senegal, EU countries, China, and India. Tourism (mainly from Europe) is a key source of foreign exchange. Remittances are also vital.
  - U.S. investment is very limited. Opportunities exist but are constrained by small market size, infrastructure gaps, and business climate challenges.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - The Gambia has limited natural resources, primarily agricultural land along the river and potential in fisheries. Its main strategic asset is its **location** along the Gambia River (navigable deep inland) and its **democratic trajectory**.
  - Economic partnerships focus on development aid (World Bank, AfDB, EU, U.S.), regional integration within ECOWAS, and attracting investment in tourism, agriculture, and potentially light manufacturing. Its relationship with Senegal is crucial economically and logistically.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - **Transnational organized crime**, particularly cocaine trafficking using West Africa as a transit zone.
  - Potential spillover effects from **regional instability** (Sahel, Guinea).
  - **Maritime security** challenges including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in its coastal waters.
  - Internal risks relate to consolidating security sector reform and managing potential tensions arising from transitional justice processes. Low direct terrorism threat.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - U.S.-Gambia security cooperation resumed post-2017, focusing on **security sector reform** (professionalization, human rights training, civilian oversight), maritime security capacity building (small boat maintenance, training), counter-narcotics cooperation, and support for Gambia's renewed participation in peacekeeping. U.S. provides training (IMET) and limited equipment assistance.
  - The Gambia Armed Forces (GAF) are small. ECOWAS forces (ECOMIG) remain present in The Gambia (at Gambian government request) to ensure stability during the transition period.
  - Future cooperation focuses on completing SSR, building maritime security capacity, enhancing counter-trafficking capabilities, and supporting Gambia's peacekeeping contributions.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - The Gambia's influence is primarily within **ECOWAS**, where it participates actively since its return to democracy. Its successful democratic transition gives it moral authority.
  - It is active in the **African Union** and the **Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)** (hosting the OIC Summit in 2024). It gained international attention by bringing a case against Myanmar regarding the Rohingya genocide to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - The Gambia can serve as a positive example and advocate for democracy within ECOWAS and AU. Its ICJ case demonstrates potential for leadership on international justice issues. U.S. can support its constructive role in regional diplomacy and multilateral forums.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Significant progress since 2017, but challenges remain. Key issue is implementing **TRRC recommendations** for accountability and reparations. Strengthening judicial independence and capacity, combating corruption, and ensuring security forces respect human rights are ongoing tasks. Media freedom has improved vastly but needs consolidation.
  - U.S. strongly supports these reform efforts through technical assistance and diplomatic engagement.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Democratic system appears relatively stable under President Barrow, who won re-election in 2021. Coalition politics can be fluid. Policy continuity focuses on consolidating democracy, economic recovery, and implementing the National Development Plan. Successful completion of transitional justice and SSR are key for long-term stability.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN and its agencies
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - African Union (AU)
  - ECOWAS
  - Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)
  - African Development Bank (AfDB)
  - International Criminal Court (ICC) (rejoined after Jammeh withdrawal)
  - AGOA eligibility
  - MCC Threshold Program agreement
  - USAID development assistance agreements
  - Peace Corps agreement
  - Various international conventions (climate, biodiversity, human rights, etc.)
  - Interpol

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Main concerns are **structural development challenges**: poverty, unemployment, reliance on volatile sectors (tourism, agriculture), infrastructure gaps (especially energy). No major U.S. sanctions. Access to international markets (e.g., via AGOA) is important but capacity to export is limited.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Opportunities lie in supporting **economic diversification**. Promoting investment (DFC potentially) in agribusiness (cashews, horticulture, fisheries), light manufacturing, and renewable energy (solar). Supporting implementation of AfCFTA to boost regional trade. Enhancing tourism sector sustainably. Improving business climate through MCC threshold program and other assistance.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Stability heavily linked to Senegal. Regional instability (Sahel, coups) poses indirect risks. The Gambia maintains generally neutral foreign policy, active in ECOWAS. Presence of ECOMIG forces reflects ongoing need for security support during transition.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Low direct terrorism risk. **Transnational crime (drug trafficking)** is main security concern. Cybersecurity capacity very low. Low risk of military escalation. Main risks are internal political tensions or economic instability.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Significant Gambian diaspora in Europe/US provides remittances. Irregular migration (especially youth seeking opportunities in Europe) is an issue. U.S. cultural influence present. Peace Corps program active. Public opinion generally positive towards U.S., especially appreciating support for democratic transition.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Predominantly Muslim society, generally tolerant. Shared democratic aspirations post-Jammeh. Importance of family/community. Divergences may exist on some social issues compared to U.S.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - The Gambia highly vulnerable to sea-level rise (coastal erosion, threats to Banjul), changing rainfall (impacting agriculture), saltwater intrusion in Gambia River. U.S. interest in regional stability affected by climate vulnerability, supporting adaptation efforts.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Support **climate adaptation** projects (coastal defenses, climate-resilient agriculture, water management). Promote **renewable energy** (solar has high potential). Access to climate finance (GCF, Adaptation Fund) is crucial.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Coastal erosion threatens capital city. Agricultural disruption can worsen poverty/food insecurity. Competition over resources (water, land) could increase if not managed.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have shown **less interest in supporting The Gambia's democratic consolidation** and transitional justice process, potentially reducing funding for democracy/governance programs. Focus might have shifted narrowly to transactional cooperation (e.g., counter-narcotics) or migration control.
- Skepticism towards development aid could have impacted USAID programs. Support for multilateral efforts (ECOWAS, UN peacekeeping) might have weakened.
- Impact could have been reduced U.S. leverage to support democratic reforms, potentially undermining progress made since 2017. The Gambia might have perceived the U.S. as a less reliable partner in its development and democratic journey.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, the U.S. should **immediately reaffirm strong support for The Gambia's democracy**, transitional justice, and development. Restore funding for democracy/governance programs and development aid. Re-engage robustly in supporting ECOWAS and multilateralism.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Gambia Partnership for Agricultural Resilience and Rural Prosperity"**:
    - **Climate-Smart Agriculture:** Provide technical assistance (USAID/Feed the Future, USDA) and inputs for climate-resilient crops (millet, sorghum, rice varieties), improved water management (small-scale irrigation), and soil conservation techniques. Support agricultural research capacity.
    - **Value Chain Development:** Support farmer cooperatives, improve post-harvest storage/processing for key crops (groundnuts, cashews, horticulture, fisheries), and facilitate access to finance and markets (including potential niche exports to U.S.). Promote quality standards.
    - **Rural Livelihood Diversification:** Support initiatives promoting off-farm income generation in rural areas (e.g., poultry, beekeeping, small-scale processing, eco-tourism linked to river/nature). Fund vocational training for rural youth.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Gambia Agricultural Working Group** to coordinate these efforts, monitor progress (e.g., crop yields, farmer incomes, adoption rates of new techniques), and ensure alignment with The Gambia's National Development Plan.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. support for Gambian farmers and rural communities. Expand exchanges focused on agriculture, environment, and rural development (Peace Corps, university links).

- **Programs:** Support preservation of cultural/historical sites. Fund cultural exchanges. Use public diplomacy to highlight Gambia's democratic progress and U.S. partnership.

**Tariff Report:**

- The Gambia is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the U.S. **Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)** program (when active) and the **African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)**. These programs allow duty-free access to the U.S. market for thousands of products, although Gambia's capacity to utilize these preferences is limited. Standard U.S. tariffs apply otherwise.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- Immigration from The Gambia to the U.S. is relatively small but growing, occurring through family reunification, the Diversity Visa lottery, and student visas. There is also some irregular migration and asylum seeking, particularly among youth.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens **require a visa** to enter The Gambia. Visas can generally be obtained on arrival at Banjul International Airport for tourism or business stays (typically up to 30 days, fee applies). However, it is advisable to check current requirements or obtain a visa in advance from a Gambian embassy or consulate, as policies can change. Proof of yellow fever vaccination is often required.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Significant improvements since 2017, with a new constitution drafted (though not yet adopted) and institutions like the National Human Rights Commission established. However, implementation of reforms and addressing past abuses remain major challenges.
- **Affected Groups:** Victims of Jammeh-era abuses seeking justice/reparations. Journalists still face occasional harassment despite increased freedom. Women and girls face challenges (FGM, GBV). Security forces require further reform to ensure full respect for rights.
- **Suppressed Rights:** While overt suppression has ended, weak institutions, lack of resources, and political hurdles can impede full enjoyment of rights (e.g., access to justice, accountability). Laws restricting media or assembly from the previous era may need further reform.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Provide strong, sustained support for the **transitional justice process** (TRRC implementation, accountability mechanisms). Fund programs strengthening **judicial independence, security sector reform (with human rights focus), electoral processes, media freedom, and civil society capacity**. Use diplomatic engagement to encourage continued progress on reforms and accountability. Ensure U.S. assistance reinforces democratic norms and human rights standards.
