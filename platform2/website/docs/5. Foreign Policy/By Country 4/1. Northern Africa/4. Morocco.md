**Morocco: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

Morocco has long been a key ally of the United States in North Africa, characterized by a partnership grounded in shared interests ranging from security cooperation to economic ties. Recently, the U.S. has reaffirmed its support for Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, a contested territory with significant political implications. The normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel, facilitated by the Abraham Accords, has also provided new avenues for security and economic collaboration in the region. As the U.S. navigates complex political landscapes in the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco remains a cornerstone for promoting stability, counterterrorism efforts, and economic development.

### **Crises**:

Morocco, while relatively stable compared to its neighbors, faces several crises that could impact its relationship with the United States. The ongoing stalemate over Western Sahara represents a significant geopolitical challenge, with tensions between Morocco and the Polisario Front continuing to simmer. The humanitarian situation in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria remains a concern, as Morocco is expected to engage diplomatically to resolve this long-standing conflict. Furthermore, the country is experiencing social unrest due to rising unemployment and economic disparities, particularly among the youth. These domestic pressures could destabilize the political landscape and create challenges for U.S. interests in the region.

Additionally, the broader North African region is grappling with security threats from extremist groups, particularly in the Sahel region. The potential for spillover violence from conflicts in neighboring countries, such as Libya and Mali, poses risks to Morocco's internal security and stability. The U.S. has a vested interest in supporting Morocco's counterterrorism initiatives to mitigate these threats and foster a secure environment conducive to economic growth. Moreover, Morocco's role as a transit country for migrants seeking to reach Europe highlights the need for coordinated efforts to address migration and human rights issues.

Looking ahead, Morocco faces climate change challenges, particularly water scarcity and its impact on agricultural productivity. These environmental stresses could exacerbate existing social tensions and contribute to unrest if not addressed. The U.S. can play a pivotal role in helping Morocco develop sustainable practices and invest in renewable energy to combat these challenges. Overall, while Morocco presents a stable partner, its internal and regional crises require careful navigation to maintain a fruitful bilateral relationship.

**Frank Narrative**

Morocco offers significant opportunities for the United States to advance its strategic interests in North Africa and the broader Mediterranean region. Historically, Morocco has contributed to U.S. counterterrorism efforts through intelligence sharing and military cooperation. The Moroccan military's participation in joint exercises with U.S. forces, particularly in the areas of training and capacity building, has strengthened the security partnership. As the region faces increasing threats from extremist groups, continued U.S. support for Morocco's military capabilities will be crucial in maintaining stability.

In terms of economic collaboration, Morocco's strategic location along key trade routes and its burgeoning renewable energy sector present ample opportunities for investment. The U.S. has an interest in promoting economic diversification in Morocco, moving beyond traditional sectors such as agriculture and textiles. By fostering partnerships in renewable energy and technology transfer, the U.S. can help Morocco achieve its economic goals while simultaneously addressing climate change challenges. Enhanced trade agreements and investment frameworks can also serve to solidify this cooperative relationship.

Moreover, Morocco's role as a mediator in regional diplomacy, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and relations with other Arab states, enhances its importance to U.S. foreign policy objectives. The U.S. can leverage Morocco's diplomatic ties to promote peace initiatives in the region and foster collaboration among Arab nations. Future cooperation could focus on enhancing Morocco's role as a regional leader in conflict resolution and promoting stability in neighboring countries.

In summary, Morocco's contributions to U.S. strategic interests are multifaceted, encompassing security, economic, and diplomatic dimensions. The U.S. seeks to strengthen this partnership by supporting Morocco's military capabilities, promoting economic diversification, and leveraging its diplomatic influence to advance regional stability. By working collaboratively, both countries can address mutual challenges and secure a prosperous future for the region.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Morocco faces several domestic challenges that require international support for effective resolution. The country is in need of economic diversification to reduce its reliance on traditional sectors and mitigate rising unemployment rates, particularly among the youth demographic. U.S. support in the form of technology transfer, investment in renewable energy projects, and vocational training programs can contribute significantly to addressing these economic challenges.

Additionally, Morocco requires assistance in enhancing its public health infrastructure, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengthening healthcare systems, improving access to medical services, and facilitating vaccine distribution are critical areas where U.S. support can have a meaningful impact. Furthermore, Morocco would benefit from collaborative efforts in addressing climate change, particularly in water management and sustainable agricultural practices.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Morocco is a North African country located on the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, bordered by Algeria to the east and southeast and Western Sahara to the south. Its political system is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The population is approximately 36 million, with a GDP of around $124 billion. Morocco has made significant strides in improving quality of life, with a Human Development Index ranking of 121 (out of 189 countries) and a Freedom Index score of 3.5 (on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being the most free).

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Morocco's strategic location makes it a vital partner for the U.S. concerning regional stability, counterterrorism, and trade routes. The country serves as a gateway between Europe and Africa, and its stability is crucial for managing migration flows and addressing security threats in the region. Moreover, Morocco's moderate political stance and commitment to security cooperation align with U.S. interests in promoting peace and stability in North Africa.

**Democracy Score:**

Morocco's political landscape is characterized by a constitutional monarchy led by King Mohammed VI, who holds significant power over the government. While there are democratic structures in place, governance practices often fall short of international standards for human rights and democratic freedoms. The ruling party is the Justice and Development Party (PJD), which has been in power since 2011. However, political dynamics reveal a complex interplay between the monarchy and elected officials, often leading to a lack of true democratic governance.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**

The U.S. and Morocco have enjoyed a long-standing relationship since the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1786, making it the first country to recognize the United States. Significant moments in recent history include Morocco's participation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020. These events underscore Morocco's strategic importance to U.S. foreign policy in the region.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

Morocco has engaged in various partnerships with the U.S., including military cooperation through the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program and the 2011 Free Trade Agreement, which has facilitated trade and investment. Nevertheless, tensions persist surrounding the Western Sahara conflict and human rights issues that have strained bilateral relations at times.
