**Western Sahara: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### Preface

Western Sahara, a territory located in North Africa, remains a region of geopolitical contention, primarily involving Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) led by the Polisario Front. The United States has historically been involved in diplomatic efforts regarding this dispute, as it impacts regional stability and relations with key allies. Recent events, including the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in late 2020, have further complicated the situation. This move, while aimed at strengthening ties with Morocco, has drawn international criticism and raised concerns about the rights of the Sahrawi people.

### Crises:

Western Sahara continues to face significant crises, both politically and socially. The long-standing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front has resulted in a stalemate, with sporadic outbreaks of violence and ongoing tensions. The region is characterized by a lack of political resolution, leading to a humanitarian crisis for the Sahrawi people, many of whom live in refugee camps in Algeria. The ceasefire established in 1991 has been tenuous, with military skirmishes resuming in recent years, particularly after the breakdown of peace talks.

The humanitarian situation is exacerbated by limited access to resources and basic services for the displaced Sahrawi population. A significant portion of the population relies on international aid, which has been hampered by the political stalemate. The economic challenges further compound the issues, as the unrecognized nature of the SADR limits opportunities for development and investment in the region.

In addition, the geopolitical ramifications of the Western Sahara conflict extend beyond local borders. The involvement of regional powers and the interests of external actors, including the U.S. and European nations, complicate the dynamics. Increased military presence and support for Morocco from the U.S. are viewed by some as undermining the pursuit of a just resolution for the Sahrawi people. Moreover, the potential for increased violence and instability poses risks to the broader Sahel region, which is already grappling with issues related to terrorism and organized crime.

Looking ahead, the potential for renewed conflicts remains high. The rise of extremist groups in the region and the ongoing challenges of governance and political representation could lead to further unrest. The United States must be vigilant in its approach to ensure that its policies contribute to stability rather than exacerbate existing tensions.

**Frank Narrative** 

Western Sahara presents a unique challenge for U.S. foreign policy, as the region is not only pivotal in North African geopolitics, but it also embodies complex dynamics involving human rights, self-determination, and international law. The U.S. has historically supported Morocco, viewing it as a key ally in combating terrorism and promoting stability in the region. However, this support has raised questions regarding the rights of the Sahrawi people and the legitimacy of their claims to self-governance. The U.S. must navigate this terrain delicately, balancing its strategic interests with the moral imperatives of human rights and justice.

In the context of regional security, the U.S. has a vested interest in ensuring that Western Sahara does not become a breeding ground for extremism. The tensions between Morocco and the Polisario Front, if left unresolved, could lead to an escalation of violence and instability that would have far-reaching implications. The U.S. could leverage its influence to encourage dialogue and negotiations, fostering an environment conducive to a peaceful resolution. This approach would not only align with American values of democracy and human rights but also serve the strategic objective of regional stability.

As the U.S. contemplates its future role in Western Sahara, it must also consider the humanitarian implications of the ongoing conflict. The plight of the Sahrawi people living in refugee camps remains a pressing issue, and American support for humanitarian assistance and development initiatives could play a significant role in alleviating their suffering. By investing in the welfare of the Sahrawi population, the U.S. can strengthen its moral standing and create goodwill that may facilitate future negotiations.

Ultimately, the situation in Western Sahara requires a nuanced and multi-faceted approach. The U.S. must be prepared to engage with all stakeholders, promoting a dialogue that respects the rights of the Sahrawi people while ensuring that Morocco's security concerns are addressed. By fostering cooperation and understanding, the U.S. can help pave the way for a just and lasting resolution to one of the longest-standing territorial disputes in modern history.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

The United States has historically viewed Morocco as a key partner in North Africa, particularly concerning counterterrorism and regional stability. Morocco's strategic location serves as a gateway between Europe and Africa, making it crucial for U.S. interests in trade and security. Continued cooperation from Morocco in intelligence sharing and counterterrorism operations is vital for maintaining regional security. In the future, the U.S. could seek to enhance military cooperation with Morocco, including joint training exercises and arms sales, to bolster its capacity to counter extremist threats.

Additionally, fostering a peaceful resolution to the Western Sahara conflict would significantly enhance U.S. regional influence. A stable and peaceful Western Sahara could lead to improved relations between Morocco and its neighbors, thus contributing to greater regional stability. The U.S. would benefit from playing a mediating role in negotiations, leveraging its relationship with Morocco to encourage dialogue with the Polisario Front. This would not only support U.S. strategic interests but also align with the broader goals of democracy and human rights.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Morocco seeks continued support from the United States to bolster its economic development and security. U.S. assistance in diversifying Morocco's economy, particularly beyond agriculture and tourism, can help address domestic challenges and enhance its resilience to external shocks. Technological assistance in renewable energy and infrastructure development would further align with Morocco's economic goals.

Moreover, Morocco would benefit from U.S. support in addressing the humanitarian situation in Western Sahara. Increased humanitarian aid and development assistance for the Sahrawi people can contribute to alleviating their suffering and fostering a more stable environment, ultimately supporting Morocco's long-term interests in the region.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Western Sahara is a disputed territory located in North Africa, bordered by Morocco to the north, Algeria to the east, and Mauritania to the south. The region covers an area of approximately 266,000 square kilometers and has a population of around 500,000 people, primarily composed of the Sahrawi ethnic group. The territory's political system is characterized by a lack of recognized governance, as Morocco claims sovereignty over the region, while the Polisario Front seeks independence for the Sahrawi people. The economy relies heavily on fishing, phosphate mining, and agriculture, with a GDP estimated at around $1 billion. The quality of life is significantly impacted by the ongoing conflict, leading to limited access to basic services and resources for the Sahrawi population.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Western Sahara's location is strategically significant as it lies along key shipping routes and borders the Atlantic Ocean. The region's natural resources, particularly phosphates and fisheries, are also of interest to global markets. The U.S. has an interest in maintaining stability in Western Sahara to prevent the spillover of conflict into neighboring countries, particularly in the context of rising extremism and terrorism in the Sahel region. The situation in Western Sahara also has implications for U.S. relations with Morocco, an important ally in North Africa, which is crucial for counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Western Sahara is complex, given the territorial dispute and lack of sovereignty for the Sahrawi people. The ruling party, the Polisario Front, seeks independence and self-determination for the Sahrawi population but operates in a context of limited international recognition. Governance practices in the region are marked by challenges to democratic freedoms, as the Sahrawi people have limited access to political representation. Comparatively, Morocco's government has faced criticism for human rights abuses and suppression of dissent, impacting overall democratic governance in the region.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
The U.S. established diplomatic relations with Morocco in 1786, making it one of the first countries to recognize U.S. independence. The Western Sahara conflict began in the mid-20th century, with Spain relinquishing its colonial rule in 1975, leading to a territorial dispute with Morocco. A ceasefire was established in 1991, but efforts for a political resolution have largely stalled.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
The U.S. has historically supported Morocco's claims over Western Sahara, particularly following the recognition of Moroccan sovereignty by the Trump administration in December 2020. Bilateral relations have been characterized by security cooperation and economic partnerships, but the unresolved status of Western Sahara remains a point of contention, impacting diplomatic ties.
