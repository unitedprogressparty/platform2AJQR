# **Hungary: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Hungary share a complex and often strained relationship despite both being NATO allies. While historical ties exist and cooperation occurs in some areas (defense industry, specific economic sectors), the relationship has been increasingly challenged by significant concerns regarding **democratic backsliding, erosion of rule of law, and close ties with Russia and China** under the government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party. The U.S. views Hungary's deviation from democratic norms, restrictions on media freedom and civil society, challenges to judicial independence, and foreign policy alignment (e.g., obstructing EU consensus on Russia sanctions or Ukraine aid, deepening ties with Moscow/Beijing) as undermining shared transatlantic values and strategic interests. Current relations are **tense and marked by significant disagreements**, particularly over democratic governance and foreign policy orientation. U.S. engagement focuses on maintaining alliance commitments within NATO, supporting Hungarian civil society and independent media, expressing concerns about democratic backsliding, and encouraging alignment with EU/NATO partners on key geopolitical issues like Russia and China.

### **Crises**

Hungary faces several challenges, primarily political and related to its international standing. The most significant is the ongoing **crisis of democratic governance and rule of law**, as perceived by the EU, U.S., and international watchdogs. Under Orbán's Fidesz government (in power since 2010), concerns have grown about media capture, erosion of judicial independence, restrictions on academic freedom and civil society, corruption/cronyism, and electoral system changes favoring the ruling party. This has led to **friction with the European Union**, resulting in frozen EU funds due to rule of law conditionality mechanisms, impacting Hungary's economy and international reputation.

Regionally, Hungary's **close relationship with Russia**, including continued energy dependence (gas, nuclear fuel/Paks II expansion project with Rosatom) and often dissenting voice within the EU/NATO regarding policies towards Moscow (e.g., slow-walking sanctions, opposing Ukraine aid packages), creates tensions with allies and poses challenges to transatlantic unity, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Its growing **economic ties with China** (e.g., major investments like battery plants, Belt and Road participation) also raise concerns among Western partners about strategic dependencies and influence.

Economically, while Hungary has experienced growth, it faces challenges related to **inflation**, labor shortages, reliance on foreign investment (particularly German automotive sector), and the need for structural reforms to boost long-term competitiveness. The freezing of EU funds due to rule of law concerns has impacted public investment and economic sentiment.

Anticipated future crises could include further **deterioration of democratic standards** leading to deeper conflict with the EU and potentially impacting NATO cohesion. **Economic vulnerability** could increase if EU funds remain blocked long-term or if global economic conditions worsen. **Political instability** could arise if opposition forces manage to coalesce more effectively or if social discontent grows over economic issues or governance. Continued **divergence from EU/NATO consensus on Russia/China** could lead to further isolation within these alliances. Managing these political and economic pressures while navigating complex regional/global dynamics is Hungary's key challenge.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Hungary's potential to contribute positively to U.S. regional goals is currently significantly hampered by its government's policies and foreign policy orientation. Historically, following its transition from communism, Hungary was a strong supporter of Euro-Atlantic integration, joining NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004 with U.S. backing. It contributed troops to **NATO missions** (e.g., Balkans, Afghanistan) and hosted NATO facilities (e.g., Pápa Air Base used for Strategic Airlift Capability). It cooperated on **counterterrorism** and law enforcement matters. Its location gives it strategic importance in Central Europe.

However, under the current government, Hungary often acts in ways that **counter U.S. regional goals**. Its obstructionist stance within the EU/NATO on issues related to Russia and Ukraine undermines transatlantic unity and efforts to support Kyiv. Its democratic backsliding contradicts U.S. goals of promoting democracy and rule of law in Europe. Its deepening ties with Russia and China provide openings for malign influence in Central Europe.

Looking forward, a **Hungary fully recommitted to democratic values and transatlantic alignment** *could* significantly help U.S. goals. This would involve:
1.  **Aligning fully with EU/NATO policy on Russia**, including robustly supporting Ukraine, enforcing sanctions, and reducing energy/political dependence on Moscow.
2.  **Restoring democratic checks and balances**, ensuring judicial independence, media freedom, and a level playing field for civil society and opposition, thereby strengthening European democratic resilience.
3.  Playing a **constructive role in regional stability**, particularly supporting the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkans based on democratic conditionality, rather than pursuing narrow interests or aligning with problematic actors.
4.  Contributing reliably to **NATO collective defense**, meeting spending commitments and participating fully in Alliance missions/exercises without obstruction.
5.  Adopting a more **cautious approach to relations with China**, aligning with EU de-risking strategies and ensuring transparency/sustainability in investments.

Achieving this requires a fundamental shift in the current Hungarian government's approach or a future change in government. U.S. policy aims to encourage such shifts through diplomatic pressure, support for democratic forces within Hungary, and leveraging EU/NATO frameworks, while maintaining necessary alliance cooperation where possible. Accountability would involve monitoring Hungary's voting records in EU/NATO, progress on rule of law reforms (per EU mechanisms), and alignment on key foreign policy issues.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

From the perspective of U.S. interests and values, Hungary *needs* to **reverse its democratic backsliding** and recommit to the core principles of the EU and NATO alliances it belongs to. It needs to restore **judicial independence**, ensure **media freedom and pluralism**, protect **academic freedom** and **civil society space**, combat **corruption** effectively, and ensure **fair electoral conditions**. It needs to **realign its foreign policy** with its Euro-Atlantic partners, particularly regarding Russia and China, upholding sanctions and supporting collective security efforts unequivocally. Economically, Hungary needs **structural reforms** to boost long-term growth, reduce vulnerabilities, and ensure **EU funds** (currently frozen due to rule of law concerns) can be accessed and used effectively for sustainable development and green/digital transitions. It needs to enhance **energy security** through diversification away from Russian sources, leveraging regional interconnectors and investing in renewables.

The current Hungarian government, however, likely perceives its needs differently. It seeks **international acceptance of its "illiberal democracy" model**, **release of frozen EU funds** without fully meeting rule of law conditions, **maintenance of economic ties with Russia and China** alongside Western partnerships ("eastern opening" policy), **non-interference** in its domestic political/social policies (e.g., on LGBTQ+ rights, migration), and **recognition of its perceived role** as a defender of national sovereignty and traditional values within the EU/West. It also seeks security guarantees through NATO membership while often challenging Alliance unity or decisions.

U.S. policy cannot accommodate the needs perceived by a government undermining democratic values and alliance cohesion. Instead, the U.S. should, in coordination with EU partners, maintain **principled pressure** on the Hungarian government to adhere to democratic norms and rule of law standards, using tools like **conditionality on EU funds** and targeted U.S. actions (e.g., visa restrictions, sanctions on corrupt actors) where appropriate. Engagement should focus on maintaining **alliance commitments within NATO** where possible, while clearly communicating concerns and supporting **Hungarian civil society, independent media, and democratic forces** working to uphold shared values. The U.S. can offer technical assistance for reforms if genuine political will emerges. The long-term need is for Hungary to return to a path fully aligned with the democratic principles of the Euro-Atlantic community it belongs to.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Republic of Hungary is a landlocked country in Central Europe, situated in the Carpathian Basin. It borders Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria. Population is around **9.6 million** (2023 estimate), experiencing demographic decline.
- Hungary is a **parliamentary republic**. It transitioned from communism in 1989-90, joining NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004. However, since 2010, under PM Orbán, it has experienced significant democratic backsliding, often described as an "illiberal democracy" or "competitive authoritarian" regime.
- Economically, Hungary is a high-income country with a GDP of around **$200 billion**. GDP per capita is roughly **$21,000**. It has an export-oriented economy heavily integrated into European supply chains, particularly the German automotive industry. Other sectors include electronics, pharmaceuticals, services, agriculture. Relies significantly on EU funds and FDI.
- Quality of life is generally good but faces challenges of inequality, emigration, and strains on public services. Life expectancy is around **77 years**.
- Freedom House ranks Hungary as **“Partly Free”** (score typically around 65-70/100), uniquely among EU member states, reflecting concerns about political rights, civil liberties, media freedom, judicial independence, and corruption under the Fidesz government.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Hungary is a **NATO ally** and **EU member state** located strategically in Central Europe.
- Its political trajectory impacts **EU unity** and democratic norms within the bloc.
- Its relationship with **Russia and China** affects transatlantic strategy towards these powers.
- It plays a role in **regional stability** (Western Balkans, Visegrád Group).
- Hosts some **NATO facilities** and participates in Alliance missions (though sometimes obstructively).
- Significant hub for **foreign investment**, particularly German automotive industry.

**Democracy Score:**

- While formally a multi-party parliamentary democracy, the political system is heavily dominated by PM Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party, which holds a constitutional supermajority. Elections are held regularly but OSCE and other observers note significant advantages for the ruling party due to biased media coverage, gerrymandering, and blurring of state/party resources, undermining fairness.
- Democratic institutions face significant challenges: **judicial independence** eroded through reforms, **media pluralism** severely limited (most outlets controlled by pro-government figures), **civil society/academia** face pressure and restrictions ("foreign agent" style laws historically), **corruption/cronyism** concerns widespread. Rule of law disputes with EU are ongoing.
- The dominant political figure is Prime Minister **Viktor Orbán** (Fidesz party), in power since 2010.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - U.S. establishes relations post-WWI (Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolution). Allied against Axis in WWII (after Hungary joined Axis).
  - **Cold War:** Hungary falls under Soviet domination. **1956 Hungarian Revolution** crushed by Soviet tanks; U.S. provides refuge for Hungarians fleeing but does not intervene militarily. Relations remain cool.
  - **1989:** Peaceful transition from communism. U.S. strongly supports democratic transition, provides assistance.
  - **1999:** Hungary joins NATO with strong U.S. backing.
  - **2004:** Hungary joins the EU. Relations generally positive, Hungary contributes troops to U.S.-led coalitions (Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq).
  - **Post-2010:** Orbán/Fidesz government consolidates power, pursues "illiberal" path. Relations with U.S. (especially under Democratic administrations) become increasingly strained over concerns about democratic backsliding, rule of law, media freedom, close ties with Russia/China, and obstructionist behavior within EU/NATO.
  - **Post-2022:** Hungary condemns Russian invasion but refuses to provide military aid to Ukraine, maintains close energy/political ties with Moscow, often obstructs EU sanctions/aid packages, further increasing tensions with U.S./allies.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - Allied within NATO since 1999. No direct conflicts. History of strong partnership post-Cold War, significantly deteriorating post-2010 due to governance/foreign policy divergence.
  - Key agreements include NATO treaty, EU-U.S. framework agreements, bilateral defense cooperation agreements (SOFA), participation in Visa Waiver Program (partially suspended for Hungarian passport holders born outside Hungary due to security concerns), Double Taxation Treaty (U.S. terminated recently due to Hungary blocking OECD global tax deal), MLAT, Extradition Treaty.
  - Bilateral relations are currently **tense and difficult**, characterized by fundamental disagreements on democratic values and foreign policy alignment, despite shared NATO membership. U.S. policy balances maintaining alliance commitments with expressing concerns and supporting democratic forces.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Hungary trade totals around **$7-8 billion** annually. U.S. exports include machinery, electrical equipment, vehicles, medical equipment. U.S. imports include vehicles/parts, machinery, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals.
  - Hungary's main trading partners are within the EU (especially Germany). China and Russia also significant partners.
  - U.S. is a major foreign investor in Hungary (manufacturing, services, IT). German investment (especially automotive) is crucial for Hungarian economy. Hungary actively courts Chinese investment (e.g., battery plants, infrastructure).
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Hungary has limited domestic energy resources, heavily reliant on imports (especially Russian gas/oil historically, nuclear fuel from Russia for Paks plant). Strategic asset is its **location** (Central European transport hub) and role within **European manufacturing supply chains** (especially automotive). Developing as hub for **electric vehicle battery production** (mainly Chinese/Korean investment).
  - Partnerships within EU single market fundamental. Active participant in Visegrád Group (V4 - with Poland, Czechia, Slovakia) though group cohesion weakened. Pursues "Eastern Opening" policy seeking closer ties with Russia, China, Turkey, Central Asia. U.S. economic interests involve ensuring level playing field for U.S. companies, encouraging energy diversification away from Russia, monitoring strategic dependencies created by Chinese investment, supporting alignment with EU economic governance.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - Theoretically shares NATO concerns about regional stability, terrorism, WMD proliferation. However, government often downplays Russian threat and emphasizes different concerns (migration, "gender ideology"). Cooperates on counterterrorism intelligence sharing to some extent.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - **NATO ally**, but often seen as reluctant or obstructionist partner. Meets 2% defense spending target recently. Modernizing military (acquiring German tanks, potentially other Western/non-Western equipment). Hosts NATO facilities (Pápa Air Base - Strategic Airlift Capability hub, NATO Centre of Excellence for Military Medicine). Contributes troops to some NATO missions (KFOR, historically Afghanistan).
  - Bilateral defense cooperation with U.S. exists (training, exercises, State Partnership Program with Ohio National Guard) but sometimes complicated by political tensions. Hungary maintains military ties with Russia (though limited post-2022) and seeks defense industrial cooperation with Turkey, others.
  - Future U.S. cooperation focuses on ensuring Hungary meets core NATO obligations, maintaining interoperability, utilizing hosted facilities (Pápa), encouraging greater alignment on threat perceptions (Russia).

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Active member of **EU** and **NATO**, but often plays **spoiler role**, blocking or delaying consensus on key foreign policy issues (Russia sanctions, Ukraine aid, Sweden's NATO accession). Uses veto power to extract concessions or advance own agenda.
  - Leader within **Visegrád Group** (though influence varies). Cultivates ties with **Western Balkan** countries (especially Serbia, Bosnian Serbs). Positions itself as advocate for "national sovereignty" and "illiberal" model, challenging mainstream EU/Western norms. Maintains active diplomacy with **Russia, China, Turkey**.
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Limited potential currently due to government's obstructionist tendencies and divergent foreign policy. Often undermines rather than facilitates multilateral cooperation on issues prioritized by U.S./EU. U.S. strategy involves working around Hungarian obstruction where possible, maintaining pressure for alignment, and engaging pragmatically where necessary within multilateral frameworks.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Major concerns regarding **democratic backsliding**: erosion of judicial independence, media capture by pro-government interests, restrictions on academic freedom/civil society, gerrymandered electoral system favoring Fidesz, widespread corruption/cronyism linked to ruling party. LGBTQ+ rights restricted through legislation.
  - These issues are central point of friction with U.S./EU. EU has frozen significant funds due to rule of law deficiencies (using conditionality mechanism). U.S. imposes visa restrictions on individuals undermining democracy, funds programs supporting independent media/civil society.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Fidesz party under Orbán holds strong parliamentary supermajority, ensuring high degree of government stability and policy continuity focused on consolidating power, pursuing "illiberal" model, maintaining ties with East/West ("balancing act"), prioritizing national sovereignty narrative. Opposition remains fragmented/weak.
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - NATO
  - UN and its agencies
  - European Union (EU) (U.S. engages Hungary within EU-U.S. framework)
  - Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
  - Council of Europe
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - OECD
  - U.S.-Hungary bilateral agreements (SOFA, defense cooperation MOUs, MLAT, Extradition Treaty, etc.)
  - U.S. Visa Waiver Program (partially suspended for Hungarians born outside Hungary)
  - Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)
  - Various international conventions (climate, biodiversity, chemical weapons, NPT, etc.)
  - Interpol / Europol cooperation
  - (U.S. terminated Double Taxation Treaty with Hungary in 2023)

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Concerns focus on **rule of law/corruption** impacting business climate/fair competition for U.S./Western firms. Hungary's blocking of EU consensus (e.g., on OECD global minimum tax) creates friction. Hungary implements EU sanctions on Russia but often seeks exemptions or criticizes them. U.S. has concerns about strategic dependencies created by **Chinese investment** (e.g., Huawei presence, battery plants).
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Limited opportunities for new initiatives given political context. Focus is on ensuring fair treatment for existing U.S. investors, encouraging alignment with EU economic governance/standards, promoting energy diversification away from Russia, and scrutinizing strategic investments from adversarial nations. Potential exists within U.S.-EU TTC framework if Hungary engages constructively.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - Hungary's stance on **Russia/Ukraine war** (refusal of military aid to Kyiv, criticism of sanctions, maintaining high-level ties with Moscow) is major source of tension within NATO/EU and with U.S. Close ties with **Serbia** and support for Bosnian Serb leader Dodik create friction regarding Western Balkan stability. Tensions with **Ukraine** over Hungarian minority rights in Transcarpathia. Complex relationship within Visegrád Group (alignment with Slovakia, divergence with Poland/Czechia on Russia).
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Low direct terrorism risk. Exposure to **Russian/Chinese hybrid warfare** (disinformation, cyber threats, espionage - potentially facilitated by government's orientation). Risk relates more to Hungary undermining collective NATO/EU response to regional security threats rather than direct military escalation involving Hungary itself.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Government pursues strong anti-immigration stance, built border fence. Hosts Ukrainian refugees but rhetoric less welcoming than neighbors. Significant Hungarian diaspora (US, neighboring countries). Government actively promotes conservative cultural narratives. U.S. cultural influence present but often criticized by government/pro-government media. Public opinion polarized, Fidesz maintains strong support base, opposition fragmented. Views on U.S./EU/Russia influenced by domestic politics/media environment. U.S. exchange programs (Fulbright) continue but face scrutiny.
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Significant divergence promoted by government on issues like LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, migration, multiculturalism, aligning with conservative/nationalist ideology. Claims to defend "Christian Europe." Strong divergence from mainstream U.S./EU values on democracy/liberalism. Shared history within Western civilization exists but often downplayed by current government narratives emphasizing unique Hungarian path.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Hungary vulnerable to droughts, heatwaves impacting agriculture (Pannonian basin), floods. Environmental concerns also related to industrial pollution, water management (Danube/Tisza rivers). Government commitment to climate action seen as lagging by EU standards, though participates in EU goals. U.S. interest in global climate action, European energy transition.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Potential exists for cooperation on renewables (solar, geothermal), energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, water management, but often hindered by political context/government priorities. U.S. investment in green tech possible if business climate allows. Collaboration within EU frameworks possible.
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Drought/water management issues require regional cooperation. Energy transition challenges impact economy/relations with EU. Reliance on Russian nuclear fuel/technology for Paks II expansion creates long-term dependency/risk.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have seen a **warming of relations** at the leadership level, given Orbán's ideological alignment and cultivation of ties with U.S. conservatives. Trump might overlook democratic backsliding concerns in favor of perceived alignment on issues like migration or criticism of multilateralism/EU.
- However, Trump's potential questioning of NATO or transactional approach could still create uncertainty. Focus might be narrow, potentially ignoring broader strategic context or alienating other European allies.
- Impact could be improved superficial relations but potentially at cost of U.S. credibility on democracy/values, further divisions within NATO/EU, and potentially emboldening Orbán's illiberal policies domestically and regionally.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- Restoring bilateral relations to a full strategic partnership requires **fundamental changes in Hungarian government policy**, particularly regarding democratic norms, rule of law, and foreign policy alignment (especially on Russia/China). U.S. policy should maintain pressure for these changes while keeping dialogue channels open and supporting democratic forces. Post-Trump (hypothetical), U.S. should re-emphasize commitment to democracy/rule of law as core of relationship, coordinate closely with EU, and condition full partnership restoration on verifiable reforms.
- Launching a revitalized agricultural partnership would be **contingent on broader political realignment**. If conditions improve, a **"U.S.-Hungary Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development"** could focus on:
    - **Modernization & EU Standards:** Provide technical assistance (USAID, USDA) supporting modernization of Hungarian agriculture, alignment with EU Green Deal sustainability standards, improving food safety, developing value chains (e.g., high-quality processed foods, wine).
    - **Climate Resilience & Water Management:** Collaborate on climate-smart agriculture practices adapting to Pannonian basin conditions (drought), sustainable water management (irrigation efficiency, protecting Danube/Tisza).
    - **Market Access & Trade:** Work within U.S.-EU framework to ensure smooth agricultural trade. Support Hungarian niche exports to U.S. market. Facilitate U.S. agribusiness investment in Hungary (conditional on fair competition/rule of law).
- Utilize existing bilateral dialogues and U.S.-EU platforms (post-realignment) to coordinate cooperation.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting benefits of democratic alignment for agricultural prosperity/sustainability. Expand exchanges for farmers, researchers, students (Fulbright, university links).

- **Needs (perceived by current regime):** Acceptance of "illiberal" model; release of EU funds; non-interference; continued benefits of EU/NATO membership without full adherence to norms/commitments; balanced ties East/West. (U.S. cannot meet these).

**Concrete Policy Proposal:**

- Implement a **"Principled Engagement Strategy focused on Alliance Integrity and Democratic Values"**:
    1.  **Uphold NATO Commitments:** Maintain necessary military cooperation within NATO framework (e.g., regarding hosted facilities like Pápa), insist Hungary meet all Alliance obligations without obstruction.
    2.  **Coordinate with EU on Rule of Law:** Strongly support EU mechanisms linking funding to rule of law adherence; coordinate diplomatic messaging and potential targeted sanctions (visa restrictions, Magnitsky sanctions for corruption/rights abuses) with EU partners.
    3.  **Counter Malign Influence:** Actively counter Russian/Chinese disinformation in Hungary; scrutinize strategic investments from adversarial nations; support energy diversification efforts reducing Russian leverage.
    4.  **Support Democratic Forces:** Provide robust support (funding, political backing) for Hungarian independent media, civil society organizations, academic freedom, human rights defenders, and democratic opposition forces.
    5.  **Maintain Dialogue & Clear Messaging:** Keep diplomatic channels open to communicate U.S. concerns directly, express clear expectations for alignment with democratic/alliance values, and outline consequences for continued divergence.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

- **Encourage Hungary's return to full alignment with democratic norms** and rule of law standards of EU/NATO community.
- **Press Hungary to align its foreign policy** with EU/NATO consensus, particularly regarding Russia and China.

- **Opportunities:** Cooperate on health security issues within EU framework where feasible. Share best practices. Potential for U.S. investment in pharma/health tech sector.
- **U.S. Wants:** Reliable partner in European/global health security surveillance. Alignment with EU/WHO standards.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Engage primarily through EU health mechanisms; maintain awareness of potential risks related to non-Western vaccine reliance historically.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**

- **Evaluation:** Government pursues strong anti-immigration stance, built border fences. Transit country on Balkan route. Cooperates selectively within EU framework (focus on border control over solidarity/integration). Hosted Ukrainian refugees initially but rhetoric less welcoming than some neighbors.
- **Impact:** Anti-immigration policies create friction within EU. Border practices draw criticism from rights groups.
- **Response:** Engage through U.S.-EU dialogues on migration. Express concerns regarding human rights standards at border/treatment of asylum seekers. Support regional cooperation aligned with EU/international norms.
- **U.S. Wants:** Humane border management adhering to international law; constructive participation in EU migration policies.
- **Cooperation Strategy:** Primarily engage via EU channels; support civil society monitoring border practices; diplomatic messaging on rights/obligations.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**

- **Assessment:** Corruption perception high, concerns about systemic corruption linked to ruling party/elites, misuse of EU funds. Weak institutional checks/balances. Lack of transparency.
- **Measures:** Strong diplomatic pressure linking anti-corruption to EU funds/international standing. Support EU rule of law mechanisms/audits. Use targeted sanctions (Global Magnitsky) against corrupt actors. Support investigative journalism/civil society oversight.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**

- **Analysis:** Member of EU, NATO, UN, OSCE, CoE, OECD, V4. Often uses membership to block consensus or pursue narrow interests diverging from mainstream positions (especially on Russia/Ukraine).
- **Leverage:** Work with EU/NATO partners to manage/counter Hungarian obstructionism. Maintain pressure for alignment within these institutions. Support mechanisms enforcing shared values/commitments (EU rule of law conditionality).

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**

- **Issues:** Erosion of judicial independence/media freedom. Restrictions on academic freedom/civil society ("foreign agent" laws). Discrimination against **LGBTQ+ individuals** (laws restricting "promotion" of homosexuality). Concerns about **minority rights** (Roma). Government rhetoric often targets migrants, NGOs, LGBTQ+ community.
- **Influence:** Consistent public/private condemnation of democratic backsliding/rights abuses. Support for targeted civil society groups/independent media. Coordination with EU/CoE monitoring/infringement procedures. Targeted visa restrictions/sanctions.

**Technology & Cyber Cooperation:**

- **Needs:** Enhance national cybersecurity posture. Concerns about reliance on technology from adversarial states (e.g., Huawei, Russian nuclear tech). Growing tech sector needs alignment with EU standards.
- **Opportunities:** Limited due to political context. Potential for cybersecurity cooperation within NATO/EU frameworks if Hungary engages constructively. Encourage alignment with EU/U.S. approaches on trusted vendors/tech security.
- **U.S. Wants:** Prevent Hungary becoming vulnerability in NATO/EU cyber defense; limit reliance on adversarial tech; alignment on tech governance norms.

**Energy Transition & Green Finance:**

- **Roadmap:** Heavily reliant on Russian gas/nuclear fuel. Plans Paks II nuclear expansion with Rosatom (major concern). Slower progress on renewables than some EU peers. Needs investment in grid/efficiency/renewables.
- **Opportunities:** Encourage diversification away from Russian energy (LNG via region, renewables). Promote U.S./Western investment in renewables/efficiency as alternative to Russian/Chinese projects. Support alignment with EU Green Deal goals. Access to EU green finance conditional on rule of law.
- **Metrics:** Reduced reliance on Russian energy, growth in renewable capacity, progress on energy efficiency.

**Education & Workforce Development:**

- **Status:** Good basic education levels but concerns about academic freedom (e.g., Central European University forced out). Emigration of skilled workers ("brain drain"). Need for skills aligned with modern economy.
- **Initiatives:** Maintain academic exchanges (Fulbright) while monitoring academic freedom. Support independent educational initiatives. Express concerns over restrictions on universities/research.
- **Outcomes:** Preserve space for independent scholarship/thought; maintain people-to-people ties.

**Health Beyond Pandemics (Noncommunicable Diseases):**

- **Burden:** Similar NCD burden to other European nations. Lifestyle factors (smoking, diet) contribute.
- **Collaboration:** Limited focus currently given political context. Potential within EU health programs if Hungary participates constructively.

**Rule of Law & Judiciary Reform:**

- **Status:** Major area of concern/conflict with EU. Reforms under PiS-like government seen as undermining judicial independence/checks and balances. EU funds frozen due to deficiencies. New government needs to undertake substantial reforms to restore trust/access funds.
- **Assistance:** Strong diplomatic pressure coordinated with EU, linking reforms to tangible benefits (EU funds, improved international standing). Technical assistance available if genuine political will for reform emerges. Support Council of Europe/Venice Commission recommendations.
- **Benchmarks:** Positive assessments from EU Commission/European Court of Justice, implementation of agreed reforms, release of EU funds.

**Supply‑Chain Resilience:**

- **Industries:** Key hub for German automotive industry. Developing major EV battery production capacity (mainly Chinese/Korean investment), raising concerns about strategic dependencies/standards.
- **Incentives:** Cooperate within U.S.-EU TTC framework on supply chain resilience. Encourage diversification of investment in strategic sectors (batteries) towards trusted partners. Scrutinize investments linked to security risks or unfair competition.

**Diaspora & Remittance Flows:**

- **Diaspora:** Significant Hungarian diaspora (US, Canada, Western Europe, neighboring countries). Government actively engages diaspora for political support. Remittances less critical than for developing countries.
- **Engagement:** Engage Hungarian-American community promoting democratic values/transatlantic ties. Counter nationalist narratives from Budapest targeting diaspora.

**Cultural Heritage & Soft Power:**

- **Assets:** Rich history/culture (music - Liszt/Bartók, literature, architecture - Budapest), thermal baths, cuisine. Government promotes conservative cultural identity.
- **Programs:** Fund cultural/educational exchanges promoting diverse perspectives. Support independent cultural institutions. Use public diplomacy to highlight shared democratic values and counter government narratives.

**Tariff Report:**

- As an EU member, trade between the U.S. and Hungary falls under the **U.S.-EU trade relationship**. Tariffs are governed by WTO commitments and specific U.S.-EU agreements or disputes. Most trade faces low tariffs, but specific sectors can be affected by broader U.S.-EU trade tensions.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- Immigration from Hungary to the U.S. occurs primarily through family reunification, employment visas, and the Diversity Visa lottery. Hungary participates in the **U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP)**, but with restrictions imposed by U.S. in 2023 on Hungarians born outside present-day Hungary due to security concerns regarding vetting procedures for passports issued to ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens can travel to Hungary **visa-free** for short stays (up to 90 days within any 180-day period) for tourism or business, as Hungary is part of the **Schengen Area**. A valid U.S. passport is required.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** While constitutional/legal frameworks exist, human rights protections have significantly eroded under the Fidesz government due to democratic backsliding and weakening of rule of law. EU/CoE mechanisms actively scrutinizing situation.
- **Affected Groups:** **Independent media** (lack of pluralism, state control/influence), **judiciary** (independence concerns), **academia** (academic freedom restrictions), **civil society** (NGOs face pressure, "foreign agent" style laws historically), **LGBTQ+ individuals** (discriminatory legislation restricting rights/information), **asylum seekers/migrants** (harsh border policies, pushbacks), **political opposition** (unequal playing field, limited media access).
- **Suppressed Rights:** **Media freedom**, **academic freedom**, **freedom of association**, **LGBTQ+ rights**, **asylum rights**, **judicial independence**, **fair electoral competition** are all under pressure or actively suppressed to varying degrees.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Maintain strong, consistent public/private criticism of democratic backsliding and human rights violations. Provide robust **support for independent media, civil society, human rights defenders, and LGBTQ+ organizations**. Coordinate closely with EU institutions, leveraging rule of law conditionality/infringement procedures. Use **targeted sanctions** (visa restrictions, potentially Global Magnitsky) against individuals responsible for undermining democracy or significant corruption. Ensure U.S. engagement does not legitimize illiberal practices. Support OSCE/CoE monitoring.
