# **Kosovo: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Kosovo share a deep and exceptionally strong partnership, forged during Kosovo's struggle for independence and solidified since its declaration in 2008. The U.S. played a leading role in the 1999 NATO intervention that ended Serbian repression, championed Kosovo's independence, and remains its most important international supporter, politically, economically, and militarily. The relationship is based on shared democratic values, a commitment to Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity within a multiethnic framework, and cooperation on regional stability in the Western Balkans. Current relations are **excellent and foundational** for Kosovo's statehood, characterized by robust U.S. support for Kosovo's security (including through the NATO-led KFOR mission where U.S. troops participate), significant development and governance assistance (USAID), and strong diplomatic backing for Kosovo's integration into Euro-Atlantic and international institutions. The U.S. actively supports the EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia aimed at normalizing relations, viewing it as crucial for regional stability and Kosovo's long-term prospects.

### **Crises**

Kosovo faces several interconnected crises and challenges. The most significant is the **unresolved relationship with Serbia** and the ongoing **political dispute over Kosovo's statehood**. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence, and tensions periodically flare up, particularly in northern Kosovo where a Serb majority resides. Incidents like the September 2023 Banjska attack (armed Serb militants clashing with Kosovo police) highlight the fragility of the security situation and the risk of renewed conflict. The EU-facilitated dialogue aimed at normalization has stalled, representing a major political crisis for regional stability.

Internally, Kosovo grapples with **economic development challenges**. It remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, facing high unemployment (especially among youth), reliance on remittances and donor aid, corruption, and the need for structural reforms to boost private sector growth and competitiveness. Weak **rule of law** and challenges in fully implementing judicial reforms also hinder economic progress and democratic consolidation.

**Social cohesion** between the Albanian majority and Serb minority (and other smaller minorities) remains fragile, particularly in the north. Ensuring minority rights protection, promoting inter-ethnic reconciliation, and fully integrating Serb-majority municipalities into Kosovo's institutions are ongoing challenges crucial for long-term stability.

Regionally, Kosovo is situated in the complex **Western Balkans**, an area facing challenges of incomplete democratic transitions, ethnic tensions, external malign influence (especially from Russia seeking to exploit divisions), and slow progress towards EU integration. Kosovo's unresolved status impacts the entire region's stability and Euro-Atlantic prospects.

Anticipated future crises include potential **escalation of tensions with Serbia**, particularly in northern Kosovo, possibly triggered by political disputes or security incidents. Failure of the **EU-facilitated dialogue** could lead to prolonged political stalemate and instability. **Economic stagnation** or failure to address high youth unemployment could lead to social unrest or increased emigration. External **malign influence** seeking to undermine Kosovo's sovereignty or exploit ethnic divisions remains a persistent risk. Ensuring continued international support (KFOR presence, diplomatic engagement) is crucial for mitigating these potential crises.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Kosovo, as a young democracy strongly aligned with the U.S., contributes to U.S. regional goals primarily by serving as a **pro-Western, democratic partner in the strategic Western Balkans**. Its very existence as a sovereign, multiethnic state committed to Euro-Atlantic integration represents a success for U.S. policy aimed at stabilizing the region after the conflicts of the 1990s. Kosovo actively seeks **integration into NATO and the EU**, aligning with the U.S. goal of completing Europe "whole, free, and at peace." It hosts the **NATO-led KFOR mission**, providing essential support and cooperation for this long-running stability operation where U.S. troops play a significant role (Camp Bondsteel is a major U.S. base). Kosovo has demonstrated commitment to democratic norms through regular elections and peaceful transfers of power. It cooperates closely with the U.S. on **counterterrorism** efforts, including repatriation and reintegration of foreign terrorist fighters and their families from Syria, a complex issue where Kosovo has shown leadership. Kosovo generally aligns with U.S. foreign policy positions in international forums where it can participate and has strongly condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine, imposing sanctions in line with the U.S. and EU.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Kosovo's continued commitment to **democratic consolidation, rule of law, and multiethnic governance**. Strengthening its democratic institutions, combating corruption, and ensuring the rights and integration of the Serb minority are crucial for its own stability and serve as a positive regional example. The most significant way Kosovo can help achieve U.S. regional goals is by engaging constructively in the **EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia** and implementing agreed-upon normalization measures (like establishing the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities, within Kosovo's constitutional framework). Progress towards normalization is key to unlocking Kosovo's full Euro-Atlantic potential and stabilizing the Western Balkans. Continued close cooperation on **counterterrorism** and countering **transnational crime** is expected. As Kosovo develops its **Kosovo Security Force (KSF)** towards NATO interoperability (a long-term process supported by U.S.), it can increasingly contribute to regional security cooperation and potentially future peacekeeping missions. Concrete actions include fulfilling Dialogue commitments, implementing judicial/anti-corruption reforms, protecting minority rights, and continuing security cooperation. Accountability is maintained through intensive U.S.-Kosovo bilateral engagement, EU accession progress monitoring, and conditions tied to U.S. assistance programs.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Kosovo's fundamental need is continued strong **international political and security support for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Euro-Atlantic integration path**. Unwavering **U.S. diplomatic support** is essential for countering efforts to undermine its statehood and for advancing its recognition internationally (Kosovo is recognized by about 100 UN members, but not by Serbia, Russia, China, or five EU states). Continued presence of the **NATO-led KFOR mission**, with significant U.S. participation, is vital for maintaining a safe and secure environment and deterring external threats until Kosovo's own security institutions are fully capable and regional relations normalized.

Kosovo requires sustained **international support for the EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia** aimed at achieving a comprehensive normalization agreement. This includes active U.S. diplomatic engagement alongside the EU to encourage progress and ensure implementation of commitments by both parties. Kosovo needs international pressure on Serbia to cease efforts aimed at destabilizing Kosovo or blocking its international integration.

Economically, Kosovo needs significant **development assistance and support for private sector growth** to address poverty and high unemployment. U.S. assistance via USAID focuses on governance, rule of law, economic growth (energy, private sector competitiveness), and human development. Support from the EU (Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance - IPA funds) and IFIs (World Bank, IMF) is crucial. Kosovo needs investment in key sectors like **energy** (addressing unreliable supply, potentially developing renewables), **infrastructure**, **agriculture**, and **ICT**. Improving the **rule of law** and combating **corruption** are critical for attracting sustainable foreign investment (including potential DFC engagement). Benchmarks include progress on EU reforms, improved governance indicators, job growth, and increased FDI.

Kosovo needs continued support for **strengthening its democratic institutions**, including the judiciary, parliament, electoral bodies, and civil society. Assistance for **inter-ethnic reconciliation** programs and ensuring effective protection and integration of minority communities (especially Serbs) is vital for internal stability and meeting Euro-Atlantic standards. Capacity building for Kosovo's institutions to meet EU accession requirements is another key need.

## 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

- The Republic of Kosovo is a landlocked territory in the Western Balkans, bordering Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. Its geography is largely mountainous. Population is around **1.8 million** (2023 estimate), predominantly ethnic Albanian (over 90%), with a significant Serb minority (mainly in the north and enclaves) and smaller minority groups.
- Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in **February 2008**. It is recognized by a majority of UN member states, including the U.S. and most EU countries, but not by Serbia, Russia, China, and five EU states. It operates as a **parliamentary republic**.
- Economically, Kosovo is one of the **poorest countries in Europe**. GDP is approximately **$9-10 billion**. GDP per capita is low, around **$5,000**. The economy relies heavily on remittances from the large diaspora (mainly in Germany, Switzerland), international aid, and services. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is extremely high. Agriculture and some mining (lignite coal) are other sectors.
- Quality of life indicators are low compared to European averages. Life expectancy is around **77 years**. Significant challenges remain in healthcare, education, and infrastructure (especially energy supply).
- Freedom House ranks Kosovo as **“Partly Free”** (score typically around 55-60/100), reflecting functioning democratic institutions and civil liberties alongside challenges related to rule of law, corruption, political tensions with Serbia, minority rights implementation, and media pressures.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

- Kosovo's importance lies in its **strategic location in the Western Balkans**, a region critical for overall European stability.
- U.S. has deep historical investment in Kosovo's **sovereignty, stability, and democratic development** following the 1999 intervention. Its success is seen as crucial for regional peace and credibility of U.S./NATO engagement.
- Hosts **NATO's KFOR mission** and significant U.S. military presence (Camp Bondsteel).
- Key focus of **EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia**, aimed at resolving one of Europe's lingering disputes.
- Partner in **counterterrorism** efforts in the Balkans.
- Aspires to **Euro-Atlantic integration (EU, NATO)**, aligning with U.S. goals for the region.

**Democracy Score:**

- Kosovo has held regular, competitive multi-party elections since independence, deemed generally free and fair by international observers. Peaceful transfers of power occur. Basic democratic institutions (parliament, presidency, judiciary) function, though often need strengthening. Active civil society and pluralistic media exist but face political/economic pressures.
- Major challenges include weak rule of law implementation, pervasive corruption, political influence over judiciary/media, ensuring effective governance and minority rights protection (especially for Serbs), and normalization of relations with Serbia.
- The current Prime Minister is **Albin Kurti** (Vetëvendosje! movement), leading a government since 2021 focused on anti-corruption and asserting sovereignty, though facing challenges in the dialogue with Serbia. The President (largely ceremonial role) is Vjosa Osmani.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
  - Historically part of Yugoslavia/Serbia. Kosovo Albanians face repression under Milošević regime in 1990s.
  - **1998-1999:** Kosovo War. NATO intervenes with air campaign (led by U.S.) to halt Serbian ethnic cleansing campaign against Kosovo Albanians. Serbian forces withdraw. UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and NATO KFOR established.
  - **1999-2008:** Kosovo under UN administration. U.S. provides major reconstruction/development aid, supports institution-building. Status negotiations with Serbia fail.
  - **February 2008:** Kosovo declares independence. U.S. is among first countries to recognize, provides strong diplomatic support.
  - **Post-2008:** U.S. remains Kosovo's strongest international backer, supporting state-building, economic development, security sector development (KSF), and Euro-Atlantic integration path. U.S. actively supports EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia (launched 2011).
  - **Ongoing:** Deep partnership focused on sovereignty, security (KFOR), democracy, rule of law, economic development, and normalization with Serbia.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
  - U.S. led NATO intervention against Serbia over Kosovo in 1999. No direct conflict involving independent Kosovo.
  - Key agreements focus on U.S. assistance (USAID frameworks), security cooperation (support for KSF development, KFOR status agreements), rule of law support (DOJ/INL programs), potential future MCC engagement. Kosovo benefits from U.S. diplomatic recognition and advocacy.
  - Bilateral relations are **exceptionally close and foundational**, often described as a special relationship due to U.S. role in Kosovo's liberation and independence. Kosovo foreign policy is strongly aligned with the U.S.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**
  - U.S.-Kosovo trade is very small, likely under **$100 million** annually. U.S. exports include vehicles, machinery, food products. U.S. imports minimal (some minerals, agricultural products, handicrafts).
  - Kosovo's main trading partners are within the region (Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia despite political issues) and the EU (Germany, Italy).
  - U.S. investment is limited but growing, particularly in energy, ICT, construction, often facilitated by diaspora connections or development finance (DFC potential). Kosovo seeks greater U.S. investment.
- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**
  - Kosovo possesses significant **lignite coal** reserves (major source of energy but polluting), lead, zinc, nickel, and some other minerals. Agriculture and services are main economic sectors. Large, young population provides labor potential but faces high unemployment.
  - Economic partnerships heavily reliant on **international aid** (U.S., EU, World Bank, IMF) and **diaspora remittances**. Integration into regional (CEFTA) and European markets is key goal. U.S. economic interests focus on supporting Kosovo's development, stability, energy security (diversifying from coal), and integration into European economy.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**
  - **Tensions with Serbia** and potential for instability, especially in northern Kosovo.
  - **Transnational organized crime** (trafficking, smuggling) using Balkan routes.
  - **Counterterrorism:** Preventing radicalization and managing returning foreign fighters/families (Kosovo has been proactive).
  - **External malign influence** (Russia, potentially others) seeking to exploit divisions/undermine sovereignty.
  - **Cybersecurity threats**. Internal stability linked to rule of law/economic opportunity.
- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
  - Kosovo's security guaranteed primarily by **NATO's KFOR mission**, which includes significant U.S. contingent based at Camp Bondsteel. U.S. provides major support (training, equipment, advisory) for development of the **Kosovo Security Force (KSF)**, which is transitioning towards a professional, multiethnic defense force interoperable with NATO (long-term goal).
  - Kosovo aspires to join NATO (PfP program first step). Strong bilateral defense cooperation with U.S. (State Partnership Program with Iowa National Guard). Cooperates with regional partners on security issues.
  - Future cooperation focuses on continued KFOR presence, KSF development towards NATO standards, counterterrorism cooperation, cybersecurity capacity building.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
  - Kosovo's diplomatic influence limited by incomplete international recognition. Focuses on gaining further recognitions and membership in international organizations (UN, EU, NATO, Council of Europe - applied). Active participant where admitted (IMF, WB, regional bodies).
  - Strong alignment with U.S./EU foreign policy positions. Key relationship is with U.S. and major European allies (UK, Germany, France, Italy - Quint format).
- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
  - Primary focus is **EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia**. Constructive engagement here is key potential contribution. Can participate in regional cooperation initiatives (Western Balkans 6, Berlin Process). U.S. supports Kosovo's integration into multilateral structures.

## 3. Current Challenges and Opportunities

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**
  - Functioning democracy with competitive elections, active civil society/media. Major challenges remain in **rule of law implementation**, combating **corruption**, ensuring **judicial independence/efficiency**, protecting **minority rights** (especially Serbs), and addressing **war crimes/transitional justice** issues (Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague handling cases).
  - U.S. provides significant assistance (USAID, DOJ/INL) supporting reforms in these areas, linking progress to Euro-Atlantic integration prospects.
- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**
  - Generally stable governments post-elections, though coalitions can be fragile. Current Kurti government has strong parliamentary majority, providing potential for reforms but also facing criticism for approach to Serbia dialogue. Broad consensus exists across mainstream parties on strategic goals (independence, Euro-Atlantic integration, U.S. partnership).
- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**
  - UN (Kosovo not member, but UNMIK/KFOR operate under UNSC mandate; Kosovo member of some UN specialized agencies like IMF/WB)
  - IMF and World Bank
  - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
  - Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB)
  - Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) for Southeast Europe
  - Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)
  - U.S.-Kosovo bilateral agreements (Investment Incentive Agreement, cooperation MOUs on rule of law, security, energy, etc.)
  - Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) (Kosovo participates)
  - Interpol (membership application pending/contested)
  - (Kosovo aspires to join NATO PfP, Council of Europe, EU)

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**
  - Main concerns are **structural economic weaknesses**: high unemployment, large informal economy, reliance on remittances/aid, trade deficit, energy shortages/reliance on coal. Corruption hinders investment. Political dispute with Serbia creates trade barriers at times. No major U.S. sanctions on Kosovo.
- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**
  - Opportunities lie in supporting **private sector development**, attracting **FDI** (especially diaspora, U.S. investors) through improved governance/rule of law. Developing **energy sector** (renewables, improving efficiency, potentially gas transition). Supporting **ICT sector** growth. Enhancing **agricultural productivity**. Utilizing trade preferences (potential GSP access). Supporting Kosovo's path towards EU market integration (Stabilisation and Association Agreement active).

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**
  - **Unresolved status/tensions with Serbia** is overriding issue. Stability depends heavily on KFOR presence and EU/U.S. diplomacy. Relations with Albania strong. Engages within Western Balkan regional cooperation frameworks. Faces Russian/Serbian efforts to block international recognition/membership.
- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**
  - Risk of **inter-ethnic incidents/violence**, especially in north. Risk of **escalation with Serbia** (e.g., Banjska 2023). **Counterterrorism** cooperation important (managing foreign fighter returnees). **Cybersecurity** capacity needs significant development against potential state/non-state threats.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**
  - Large Kosovo diaspora (Germany, Switzerland, U.S.) crucial for remittances/investment. High youth emigration due to lack of opportunity. Strong cultural ties within Albanian-speaking world. U.S. highly popular, seen as liberator and key ally (streets/statues named after U.S. figures). Extensive U.S. exchange programs (Fulbright, IVLP, youth programs).
- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**
  - Strong pro-Western, pro-American orientation. Shared democratic aspirations. Predominantly Muslim but largely secular society. Importance of family/clan ties. Challenges relate to inter-ethnic reconciliation and strengthening civic identity.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**
  - Kosovo vulnerable to floods, droughts impacting agriculture, water stress. Heavy reliance on lignite coal causes severe air pollution and health problems, major environmental challenge. U.S. interest in regional stability, health, supporting energy transition/climate goals.
- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**
  - Major opportunity/need to support Kosovo's **energy transition** away from coal towards renewables (solar, wind, hydro potential) and energy efficiency. Requires significant investment/technical assistance (USAID, World Bank, EU). Partnering on air quality improvement, land rehabilitation (post-mining).
- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**
  - Air pollution is major public health crisis. Energy shortages impact economy/stability. Water resource management needs improvement. Lack of progress on energy transition hinders EU integration path.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term might have pursued a more **transactional approach to Kosovo-Serbia dialogue**, potentially seeking a quick deal (like the Washington Agreements of 2020 focused on economic normalization, bypassing EU) that might not address core political issues or could pressure Kosovo into unfavorable compromises.
- Commitment to KFOR/NATO presence might be questioned or linked to burden-sharing demands. Focus on democracy/governance support might decrease.
- Impact could be increased uncertainty, potential undermining of EU-led dialogue, pressure on Kosovo, though fundamental U.S. recognition/support likely endure due to historical investment/geostrategic factors.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, U.S. should **reaffirm unwavering support for Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity**. Re-commit strongly to **close coordination with EU** on Kosovo-Serbia dialogue based on mutual recognition goal. Restore emphasis on democracy, rule of law, multiethnicity. Ensure robust KFOR commitment.
- Launch a **"U.S.-Kosovo Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development"**:
    - **Productivity & Diversification:** Provide technical assistance (USAID, USDA) and finance (potential DFC) for improving yields in key crops (fruits, vegetables, grains), developing livestock sector, promoting high-value products (e.g., berries, medicinal herbs), and enhancing food processing capabilities.
    - **Climate Resilience & Water Management:** Support adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, improve irrigation efficiency, promote sustainable land management to combat erosion.
    - **Market Access & Linkages:** Support farmer cooperatives, improve storage/logistics, link farmers to domestic/regional markets (CEFTA) and potentially EU/U.S. markets (GSP utilization). Support food safety/quality standards improvement.
- Establish a **Joint U.S.-Kosovo Agricultural Working Group** to coordinate efforts, monitor progress (food security, agricultural exports, farmer incomes), and align with Kosovo's national development strategy and EU approximation process.
- Implement **public diplomacy** highlighting U.S. support for Kosovo's farmers and rural economy. Expand exchanges focused on agriculture, environment, rural entrepreneurship (university links, farmer exchanges).

**Diaspora & Remittance Flows:**

- **Diaspora:** Very large diaspora relative to population size (mainly Germany, Switzerland, Nordics, US). Remittances are crucial economic lifeline. Diaspora investment potential significant.
- **Engagement:** Engage diaspora organizations for investment, skills transfer, supporting development. Facilitate remittance channels.

**Cultural Heritage & Soft Power:**

- **Assets:** Rich history, medieval monasteries (UNESCO sites - contested status), Ottoman architecture, diverse traditions. Strong pro-U.S. sentiment is key soft power asset for U.S.
- **Programs:** Support preservation of cultural heritage (including Serb Orthodox sites). Fund cultural exchanges. Use public diplomacy to highlight shared values, U.S. support for Kosovo's future.

**Tariff Report:**

- Kosovo is not a member of WTO. It has a **Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)** with the EU, providing preferential trade access. U.S. trade relations fall under standard tariffs, though Kosovo may be eligible for **GSP** benefits (when active) for certain products. Trade volume is very low.

**Immigration to USA Report:**

- Immigration from Kosovo to the U.S. occurs primarily through family reunification (large diaspora), the Diversity Visa lottery, and some student/employment visas. Significant number sought asylum/refuge during/after 1999 conflict.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**

- U.S. citizens can travel to Kosovo **visa-free** for tourist or business stays of up to 90 days. A valid U.S. passport is required.

**Human Rights Details:**

- **Protection:** Kosovo's constitution provides strong human rights guarantees on paper, adhering to international standards. Independent institutions (Ombudsperson, courts) exist but need strengthening. Implementation is key challenge.
- **Affected Groups:** **Minority communities** (especially Serbs, but also Roma, Ashkali, Egyptians) face challenges in security, return of displaced persons, property rights, language use, political participation, and integration. **Women** face challenges related to domestic violence, property rights, economic opportunity. **LGBTQ+** individuals face societal discrimination (though legal framework improving). **Journalists** face political/economic pressures. Access to justice and accountability for **war crimes** and past abuses remain major issues.
- **Suppressed Rights:** While not systematic state suppression in manner of authoritarian regimes, practical enjoyment of rights often hindered by weak institutions, corruption, political tensions, societal attitudes, and lack of resources. Freedom of movement can be restricted during ethnic tensions. Access to fair trial impacted by judicial inefficiency.
- **U.S. Strategy:** Provide strong, consistent support for **strengthening rule of law institutions** (judiciary, prosecution, police accountability). Fund programs promoting **minority rights protection, inter-ethnic reconciliation, and integration**. Support implementation of **transitional justice** mechanisms (Specialist Chambers, domestic war crimes capacity). Advocate for **media freedom** and **civil society space**. Support efforts combating **GBV** and promoting **gender equality**. Encourage legal/social progress on **LGBTQ+ rights**. Ensure U.S. assistance programs are inclusive and promote human rights. Use diplomatic engagement to consistently raise human rights concerns with Kosovo authorities.
