# **Romania: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Romania share a robust and deepening Strategic Partnership, grounded in shared democratic values following Romania's 1989 revolution, a strong commitment to transatlantic security through NATO, and cooperation on regional stability, particularly in the Black Sea region. As a key NATO ally on the eastern flank bordering Ukraine and the Black Sea, Romania plays a critical role in Alliance deterrence and defense posture. The relationship encompasses close defense and security cooperation, including hosting U.S. rotational forces and key NATO assets (like the Aegis Ashore missile defense site), growing economic ties within the EU framework, and collaboration on energy security and countering malign influence. Current relations are **excellent and strategically vital**, significantly enhanced by the response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Romania serves as a crucial hub for supporting Ukraine, participates actively in NATO's enhanced deterrence measures, and works closely with the U.S. on Black Sea security, energy diversification, and promoting stability in Moldova and the wider region.

### **Crises**

The most significant crisis impacting Romania is the **regional security crisis** driven by Russia's war against neighboring Ukraine and its aggressive posture in the Black Sea region. This proximity places Romania on the front lines of the conflict's consequences, including dealing with refugee flows (though fewer than Poland), managing security risks in the Black Sea (drifting mines, Russian challenges to shipping), and necessitating increased defense spending and vigilance. Maintaining security and stability in the Black Sea region, a vital artery for trade and energy, is a critical challenge directly impacting Romania.

Domestically, Romania faces ongoing challenges related to **governance, rule of law, and corruption**. While progress has been made since its EU accession (2007), concerns persist about judicial independence, political influence over institutions, and effectively combating corruption, which can hinder economic development and public trust. Ensuring continued progress on reforms and strengthening democratic institutions remains crucial.

Economically, Romania, while experiencing significant growth since joining the EU, still faces challenges related to **regional disparities**, infrastructure development (especially transport), labor shortages due to emigration, and ensuring sustainable, inclusive growth. Like other European countries, it has faced **inflationary pressures** and **energy price volatility** exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, though it possesses domestic energy resources (gas, hydro, nuclear) that provide some resilience.

Regionally, instability in neighboring **Moldova**, facing Russian pressure and hybrid threats, is a direct concern for Romania due to close historical and linguistic ties. Supporting Moldova's stability and European integration path is a key Romanian foreign policy priority, aligning with U.S. goals. The broader **Black Sea security environment**, including Russian militarization and challenges to freedom of navigation, represents a persistent regional crisis.

Anticipated future crises include potential **escalation of the conflict in Ukraine** or direct **Russian provocations** in the Black Sea region impacting Romanian security or maritime trade. Continued **Russian hybrid warfare** (disinformation, cyberattacks) targeting Romania or Moldova is likely. Domestically, failure to sustain **anti-corruption efforts** or potential **political instability** could hinder progress. **Economic shocks** or challenges in absorbing EU recovery funds effectively could impact growth. **Climate change impacts** (droughts affecting agriculture, Danube river levels) also pose long-term risks.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Romania is a crucial ally for achieving U.S. strategic objectives in Southeastern Europe, the Black Sea region, and within NATO. Its primary contribution is serving as a **key NATO ally on the eastern flank**, particularly vital for **Black Sea security**. Romania hosts significant U.S. rotational military forces (e.g., at Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base - MK Base, a major hub) and critical NATO infrastructure, including the **Aegis Ashore missile defense site** at Deveselu, a core component of NATO's ballistic missile defense system. Romania actively participates in **NATO missions**, including leading the NATO multinational brigade headquarters in Craiova, contributing to air policing, and participating in maritime security efforts in the Black Sea. It is significantly increasing its defense spending towards and beyond the 2% NATO target and modernizing its military (often acquiring U.S./NATO standard equipment like F-16s, HIMARS, Patriot systems). Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Romania has played a vital role as a **hub for supporting Ukraine**, facilitating grain exports via its Black Sea port of Constanța (critical after Russia blocked Ukrainian ports), providing humanitarian aid, hosting Ukrainian refugees, and enabling transit of assistance. This directly supports core U.S. policy objectives. Romania is a strong advocate for **regional security cooperation** (e.g., Bucharest Nine - B9 format) and enhancing NATO's posture in the Black Sea region. As an **EU member state**, it contributes to transatlantic alignment on sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine and Moldova. It also plays an important role in promoting **energy security** in the region, developing its own Black Sea gas resources and supporting regional interconnectors.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Romania's continued and enhanced leadership. Maintaining strong commitment to **defense spending and military modernization** is essential for NATO deterrence. Continued reliable **hosting of U.S. and allied forces** (potentially expanding MK Base capabilities) and the Aegis Ashore site is critical. Sustained **support for Ukraine**, including facilitating grain exports and aid transit, remains a top priority. The U.S. encourages Romania to take a leading role in **Black Sea security initiatives** within NATO and potentially EU frameworks, enhancing maritime domain awareness and freedom of navigation. Continued development of its **domestic energy resources** (Black Sea gas, potentially SMR nuclear technology in partnership with U.S.) and regional **energy infrastructure** will bolster European energy security. Romania's strong support for **Moldova's stability and EU integration path** is highly valued and should continue. Strengthening **democratic institutions and rule of law** domestically enhances Romania's resilience and credibility as a partner. Concrete actions could include Romania leading specific Black Sea maritime patrols, investing further in host nation support for allied forces, championing Moldova's EU accession, and advancing key energy projects. Accountability is maintained through NATO processes, bilateral strategic dialogues, and EU coordination.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a frontline NATO state facing direct proximity to the war in Ukraine and Russian assertiveness in the Black Sea, Romania's primary need is **ironclad U.S. and NATO commitment to collective defense under Article 5**. The enhanced presence of **U.S. rotational forces** and NATO assets on its territory provides crucial deterrence and reassurance. Romania needs continued access to advanced **U.S. military technology and equipment** (F-16s, HIMARS, Patriot, potentially F-35s later) to modernize its armed forces and ensure interoperability within NATO. Efficient FMS processes and potential financial support mechanisms (FMF, loan guarantees) can facilitate this. Robust **intelligence sharing** and cooperation on **countering hybrid threats** (disinformation, cyberattacks, especially targeting Black Sea region/Moldova) from the U.S. and NATO allies are vital.

Economically, Romania needs continued integration within the **EU single market** and effective utilization of **EU funds** (Cohesion, Recovery and Resilience Facility) for infrastructure development (transport, energy), economic modernization, and green/digital transitions. Support for its efforts to become a **regional energy producer and transit hub** (Black Sea gas development, LNG import potential via neighbors, nuclear power - including SMR project with U.S. involvement) requires international investment, technology partnerships (including U.S. firms), and stable regulatory frameworks. Continued **U.S. and international investment** in Romania's growing economy (IT, manufacturing, agriculture) is needed to boost growth and create jobs.

Diplomatically, Romania needs strong **political support from the U.S. and allies** for its sovereignty and security, particularly concerning the Black Sea region. It needs international solidarity in **supporting Ukraine** and maintaining pressure on Russia. Support for its efforts to bolster the **stability and European path of Moldova** is crucial. Continued international support (from EU, U.S.) for its domestic efforts to strengthen **rule of law and combat corruption** reinforces its democratic resilience and Euro-Atlantic anchoring. Finally, Romania benefits from continued close **people-to-people ties** and educational/cultural exchanges with the U.S. and Europe.
