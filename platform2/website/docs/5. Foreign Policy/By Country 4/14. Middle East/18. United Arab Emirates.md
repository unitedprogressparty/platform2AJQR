**United Arab Emirates: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The relationship between the United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has evolved significantly since the UAE’s formation in 1971. The UAE has become a strategic partner for the U.S. in the Gulf region, particularly in terms of counterterrorism, energy security, and trade. Recent events, such as the Abraham Accords and the UAE's active role in regional conflicts, have further solidified this partnership. The UAE has been a key player in the U.S. strategy to counter Iranian influence in the region, and its economic growth and stability make it an essential ally for future regional cooperation.

### **Crises**:

The UAE faces a multitude of crises, both internally and in the broader region. One of the most pressing issues is the ongoing conflict in Yemen, where the UAE has been involved in a coalition against the Houthi rebels, leading to significant humanitarian consequences. The conflict has created a complex web of alliances and enmities that threaten regional stability. Additionally, the UAE is navigating tensions with Iran, which continues to exert influence in Iraq and Yemen, raising concerns about potential spillover violence.

Furthermore, the UAE grapples with domestic challenges, including the need for political reforms and the management of a diverse expatriate population. The recent rise of dissent and calls for greater political representation reflect underlying tensions that could lead to instability if not addressed. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated these challenges, necessitating reforms to diversify the economy away from oil dependency.

Anticipating future crises, the UAE faces the risk of increased unrest due to economic disparities and a lack of political freedoms. The potential for terrorist activities and regional insurgencies, particularly from groups like ISIS, remains a concern. The ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China adds another layer of complexity, as the UAE navigates its relationships with both superpowers while managing its own national interests.

As the UAE continues to develop its international profile, it is poised to face challenges related to climate change, particularly as it is already experiencing water scarcity and extreme heat. These environmental pressures could exacerbate existing tensions and lead to social unrest, necessitating a proactive approach to governance and international cooperation.

**Frank Narrative**

The United Arab Emirates has consistently played a vital role in supporting U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East. The UAE is a key partner in counterterrorism efforts, contributing troops and resources to combat ISIS and other extremist groups. Additionally, the UAE has been instrumental in maintaining maritime security in the Gulf, ensuring the free flow of oil and trade routes that are critical to global economic stability. The U.S. has benefitted from the UAE's intelligence-sharing capabilities, which have helped thwart potential attacks and enhance regional security.

Looking toward the future, the U.S. expects the UAE to continue its leadership role in regional security and stability. This includes supporting diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving conflicts in Yemen and Libya, as well as mitigating the risks posed by Iranian aggression. The UAE's participation in the Abraham Accords reflects its willingness to foster peace in the region, and the U.S. should encourage further normalization of relations between the UAE and other Arab states with Israel. In return, the UAE seeks continued U.S. military support and access to advanced military technologies to bolster its defense capabilities.

Both nations have mutual interests in economic diversification and technological advancement. The UAE's Vision 2021 and subsequent initiatives aim to reduce reliance on oil and promote innovation. The U.S. can provide assistance in developing sectors such as renewable energy, technology, and education. In exchange, the UAE can serve as a hub for American businesses looking to enter the Gulf market, fostering economic growth and collaboration that benefits both countries.

In terms of governance, the UAE has made strides in addressing domestic challenges, yet it faces criticism for its human rights record and lack of political freedoms. The U.S. can encourage the UAE to adopt reforms that promote greater transparency and inclusivity, enhancing its governance framework. This partnership can lead to a more stable and prosperous UAE, contributing positively to regional security and U.S. interests.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates located on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula. It has a diverse population of approximately 9.3 million, with a significant expatriate community. The UAE's GDP is around $421 billion, with a high GDP per capita of approximately $43,000. The country exhibits a high quality of life, ranking well in indices measuring education, healthcare, and economic competitiveness. However, its freedom index scores indicate limitations in political freedoms and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

The UAE's strategic location along vital trade routes in the Persian Gulf makes it a crucial player in global energy supply chains. The country possesses the seventh-largest proven oil reserves and is a leading exporter of liquefied natural gas. The UAE's role in combating terrorism and promoting regional stability aligns closely with U.S. national security interests. Its economic prowess and modern infrastructure provide opportunities for American businesses and investments.

**Democracy Score:**

The UAE is ruled by a council of monarchs, with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan serving as President. The political landscape is characterized by limited political freedoms and a lack of democratic processes. Despite some efforts to introduce reforms, the ruling party maintains tight control over governance, limiting dissent and political opposition. While the UAE has made progress in areas such as women’s rights and economic development, the lack of political pluralism remains a significant challenge.

**Historical Context:**

Key milestones in U.S.-UAE relations include the signing of a defense cooperation agreement in 1994 and the establishment of the UAE's strategic partnership with the U.S. following the events of 9/11. The UAE's participation in the coalition against ISIS in 2014 marked a significant escalation in cooperation. Recently, the Abraham Accords in 2020 represented a historic breakthrough in Arab-Israeli relations, with the UAE becoming the first Gulf state to normalize ties with Israel. While relations have generally been strong, tensions occasionally arise over human rights concerns and the UAE's foreign military engagements.
