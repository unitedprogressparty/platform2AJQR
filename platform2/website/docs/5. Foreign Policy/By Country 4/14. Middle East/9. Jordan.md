**Jordan: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Jordan has long been a crucial ally of the United States in the Middle East, serving as a stable partner in a volatile region. Recent events, particularly the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis and the normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states, have further underscored Jordan's strategic significance. The country has faced significant economic challenges, exacerbated by the influx of refugees and the impact of regional conflicts. The U.S. has provided substantial aid to Jordan, which plays a vital role in its stability and security. In return, Jordan has assisted the U.S. in various regional initiatives, including counterterrorism operations and peacekeeping efforts.

### **Crises**:

Jordan currently faces several crises that could impact its stability and, by extension, U.S. interests in the region. The ongoing Syrian civil war has resulted in over 1.4 million refugees seeking asylum in Jordan, straining the country's resources and public services. This situation has created economic challenges, leading to rising unemployment and social unrest. Additionally, Jordan is grappling with the repercussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues to threaten regional stability and poses risks of renewed violence.

In recent months, Jordan has successfully navigated internal protests and demands for political reform, demonstrating its resilience in the face of adversity. However, the government's ability to maintain stability while addressing public grievances remains a delicate balance. The potential for extremist groups to exploit the unrest and the refugee situation poses a significant threat to both Jordan and U.S. interests in the region. Moreover, the geopolitical dynamics surrounding Iran's influence and the ongoing tensions in Iraq and Syria further complicate Jordan's security landscape.

Looking ahead, Jordan anticipates potential future crises, including possible escalations in violence related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or renewed tensions with neighboring countries. The rise of extremist groups in the region and the ongoing internal challenges could further destabilize the country. Thus, Jordan's security and political stability are crucial for U.S. interests, as any significant unrest could have ripple effects throughout the region.

**Frank Narrative**

Jordan's strategic importance to the United States cannot be overstated, particularly in the context of regional stability and counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. relies on Jordan as a key partner in the fight against terrorism, providing intelligence support and military training to Jordanian forces. In return, Jordan has been an active participant in U.S.-led coalitions and initiatives aimed at combating extremist groups such as ISIS. This partnership has not only enhanced Jordan's security capabilities but has also contributed significantly to regional efforts to stabilize the Middle East.

In the economic realm, Jordan's leadership has expressed a desire for increased U.S. investment and trade opportunities. The country has been working to diversify its economy away from traditional sectors and develop its technological and renewable energy industries. The U.S. can play a crucial role in supporting these efforts through targeted investments and technological assistance. By fostering economic growth and stability in Jordan, the U.S. can help mitigate the economic pressures that contribute to social unrest and extremist recruitment.

Moreover, Jordan has demonstrated a commitment to human rights and social justice, albeit with varying degrees of success. The U.S. has an opportunity to influence Jordan's governance practices positively by promoting democratic reforms and supporting civil society initiatives. As Jordan navigates its internal challenges, the U.S. can offer guidance and resources to bolster democratic institutions and enhance rule of law. This approach not only strengthens U.S.-Jordan relations but also aligns with American values of democracy and human rights.

In summary, Jordan's role as a stabilizing force in the Middle East is critical to U.S. interests. By continuing to support Jordan in its efforts to address economic challenges, enhance security, and promote democratic governance, the U.S. can help ensure that this vital partnership remains strong and effective in the face of ongoing regional uncertainties.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Jordan is a small, landlocked country located in the Middle East, bordered by Israel, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq. The political system is a constitutional monarchy, with King Abdullah II serving as the head of state. The population is approximately 10 million, with a significant portion consisting of Palestinian refugees. Jordan's GDP is around $44 billion, with key economic indicators reflecting a mixed economy that relies heavily on services, tourism, and remittances. The country ranks relatively low on the Freedom Index, indicating challenges in political freedoms and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Jordan's strategic location makes it a pivotal player in regional stability, particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Syrian civil war. The country serves as a transit point for trade routes and energy supplies. Additionally, Jordan's commitment to counterterrorism aligns closely with U.S. strategic interests in combating extremism in the region. By maintaining a stable Jordan, the U.S. can safeguard its broader goals of peace and security in the Middle East.

**Democracy Score:**

Jordan's political landscape is characterized by a monarchy that retains significant power over governance. While the ruling party and King Abdullah II have made some attempts at political reforms, actual governance practices often fall short of democratic ideals. Public protests and calls for reform have highlighted the disconnect between official structures and real-world political dynamics. The current ruling party is the Jordanian Hashemite Kingdom, which continues to face challenges in addressing public demands for greater political participation and transparency.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
Jordan has a long-standing relationship with the U.S., dating back to the 1950s. The signing of the Jordan-U.S. Treaty of Friendship in 1957 marked a significant milestone in bilateral relations. In the 1990s, Jordan became a major non-NATO ally of the U.S., further solidifying its partnership. More recently, the U.S. has provided substantial military and economic aid to Jordan in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the fight against terrorism.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
Bilateral relations have been shaped by various agreements, including the Free Trade Agreement signed in 2001, which aimed to enhance economic cooperation. Jordan's participation in U.S.-led coalitions, such as the fight against ISIS, has further strengthened ties. However, tensions have arisen over issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Jordan's handling of domestic protests, which have occasionally strained relations.
