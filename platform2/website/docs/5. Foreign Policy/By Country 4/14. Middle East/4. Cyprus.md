**Cyprus: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The relationship between the United States and Cyprus has historically been shaped by geopolitical interests in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Cyprus, a small island nation, has been at the crossroads of various cultural and political influences due to its strategic location. Recent events, including the ongoing territorial division of the island and tensions with neighboring Turkey, have kept Cyprus in international headlines. The U.S. has shown a keen interest in supporting a peaceful resolution to the division of Cyprus and promoting stability in the region, particularly in light of Turkey's military presence in Northern Cyprus and its assertive actions in the Eastern Mediterranean.

### **Crises**:

Cyprus is currently facing a complex geopolitical crisis that stems from the island's division since 1974. The Northern part of Cyprus is administered by a Turkish Cypriot government, following a Turkish invasion that was triggered by a coup aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece. This division has led to ongoing diplomatic tensions not only between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island but also between Greece and Turkey, impacting regional stability. Recently, the discovery of natural gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean has escalated tensions, with Turkey asserting claims over waters that Cyprus considers its exclusive economic zone.

The broader region is also feeling the effects of these tensions, as they influence relations between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, raising concerns over military escalation. Additionally, rising nationalism within Turkey could lead to more aggressive policies toward Cyprus, further complicating the diplomatic landscape. The U.S. has been involved in mediating discussions in hopes of resolving the long-standing division and ensuring stability in the region.

Moreover, the ongoing conflict in Syria and the presence of extremist groups in the region pose risks to Cyprus and its neighbors. The potential for spillover effects from these conflicts could lead to increased instability, impacting not just Cyprus but also the security of Europe. As a result, the U.S. must remain engaged in the region to help mitigate these risks and support diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive resolution to the Cyprus issue.

Looking ahead, the future risks of conflict are present, particularly as nationalist sentiments rise in Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. The U.S. must be prepared to engage in proactive diplomacy to prevent potential escalations. The role of external powers, including Russia, which has shown interest in the region, further complicates the dynamics, necessitating a cohesive U.S. strategy to foster stability and peace in Cyprus.

**Frank Narrative** 

Cyprus, strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, plays a crucial role in U.S. foreign policy objectives in the Eastern Mediterranean. The island's division presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving U.S. interests, particularly concerning regional security and counterterrorism efforts. By fostering a stable and united Cyprus, the U.S. can help mitigate threats from extremist groups that may exploit the ongoing tensions in the region. Cyprus can serve as a potential partner for intelligence sharing and logistical support in counterterrorism operations, given its geographic position.

Historically, Cyprus has contributed to U.S. strategic interests by allowing the use of its ports and airfields for military and logistical operations. The U.S. has also provided support for initiatives aimed at fostering reconciliation between the Greek and Turkish communities. In the future, the U.S. hopes to see increased collaboration with Cyprus, particularly in energy security, as the country seeks to develop its natural gas resources. This development aligns with U.S. interests in diversifying energy supplies and reducing reliance on any single source.

Cyprus faces significant domestic challenges that require international support, including economic diversification and addressing the socio-political impacts of the division. The U.S. can assist Cyprus in enhancing its economic resilience by promoting trade relationships and investment opportunities. Furthermore, supporting initiatives that strengthen democratic governance and human rights can help foster a more stable society, ultimately benefiting both Cypriots and U.S. interests in the region.

In terms of future cooperation, the U.S. seeks to work closely with Cyprus to address emerging threats, including cybersecurity risks and the impact of climate change on regional stability. Collaborative efforts in these areas can enhance the resilience of both nations while promoting a sustainable future. Moreover, the U.S. hopes to encourage Cyprus to play a more active role in multilateral organizations to further regional cooperation and conflict resolution, reinforcing its position as a key partner in U.S. foreign policy in the Eastern Mediterranean.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Cyprus is an island nation located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey and west of Syria and Lebanon. It has a population of approximately 1.2 million people, with a mix of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The island’s political system is a presidential republic, with a history of division that has significantly impacted governance. Cyprus has a GDP of around $25 billion, with key sectors including tourism, financial services, and shipping. The quality of life is relatively high, with a Human Development Index (HDI) score placing it in the "very high" category. However, the division has created socio-economic disparities, particularly in the northern part of the island, which is less developed.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Cyprus' strategic location makes it a critical player in regional security and energy dynamics. The island serves as a gateway between Europe and the Middle East, providing access to vital trade routes. Additionally, with the discovery of natural gas reserves in the Levant Basin, Cyprus has the potential to become an energy hub in the Eastern Mediterranean, enhancing U.S. energy security interests. The stability of Cyprus is essential for maintaining balance in the region, especially in light of rising tensions between Greece and Turkey.

**Democracy Score:**

Cyprus has a relatively high democracy score, characterized by a multi-party system and active civil society. However, the ongoing division has hindered full democratic governance, particularly in the Turkish-controlled north, which lacks the same level of political freedoms. The ruling party in the Greek Cypriot administration is the Democratic Party (DISY), which has focused on reunification efforts and strengthening ties with the EU and the U.S. Despite these efforts, governance practices and the rule of law remain affected by the island's division.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
- In 1960, Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule, establishing a partnership agreement with the U.S.  
- The 1974 Turkish invasion led to the island's division, prompting U.S. diplomatic efforts to mediate the conflict.  
- In 2004, the Annan Plan aimed to reunify Cyprus but was rejected by the Greek Cypriots in a referendum, leading to further tensions.  
- Recent U.S. support for Cyprus in its energy exploration endeavors has strengthened bilateral relations.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
- The U.S. has provided military and economic aid to Cyprus, particularly in the context of security partnerships since the 1974 crisis.  
- The U.S. has engaged in various diplomatic initiatives to facilitate negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, promoting peace and reconciliation.  
- Relations have been strained due to Turkey's military presence in Northern Cyprus and its assertive actions in the Eastern Mediterranean.
