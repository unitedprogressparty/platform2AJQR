# Lebanon: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis

---

### **Preface**

Currently, the relationship between the United States and Lebanon is complex, shaped by a myriad of political, economic, and social factors. Lebanon has been grappling with a multifaceted crisis that includes severe economic distress, political instability, and social unrest. The U.S. has historically viewed Lebanon as a key partner in the Middle East, particularly in countering Iranian influence in the region and promoting stability. Recent events, such as the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020 and ongoing protests against government corruption, have highlighted the urgent need for reforms and international support. The U.S. has provided humanitarian assistance and has called for accountability and transparency in the Lebanese political system, emphasizing the importance of democratic governance.

### **Crises**:

Lebanon is currently facing a multifaceted crisis that encompasses political, economic, and social dimensions. The economic collapse has led to hyperinflation, skyrocketing poverty rates, and a devaluation of the Lebanese pound, which has eroded the purchasing power of the population. The World Bank has labeled Lebanon's economic crisis as one of the worst in modern history, prompting widespread protests against government ineptitude and corruption. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already dire economic situation, straining healthcare resources and increasing unemployment rates.

The political landscape remains fraught with challenges, as the country has been without a stable government for an extended period. The failure to form a government following the 2021 parliamentary elections has aggravated public frustration and highlighted the entrenched sectarian divisions that characterize Lebanese politics. This lingering instability has fueled fears of potential violence or civil unrest, as citizens grow increasingly disillusioned with the ruling elite's inability to address pressing issues.

Regional tensions further complicate Lebanon's situation. The presence of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, continues to pose significant security challenges, leading to ongoing fears of conflict with Israel. The U.S. has expressed concern about Hezbollah's military capabilities and influence within the Lebanese state, which complicates efforts to promote stability and security in the region. As Lebanon grapples with these challenges, potential conflicts involving rebel groups, sectarian violence, or external interventions remain significant risks.

Looking ahead, Lebanon faces the daunting task of implementing structural reforms and rebuilding its economy while navigating the complex interplay of internal and external pressures. The need for international support and collaboration is paramount to address the country's pressing challenges and prevent further deterioration of the situation. The U.S. can play a critical role in supporting Lebanon through diplomatic engagement, economic assistance, and promoting democratic governance.

**Frank Narrative** 

Lebanon's current situation is a reflection of decades of political mismanagement, corruption, and external interference. The aftermath of the Beirut port explosion in August 2020 serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for reform and accountability within the Lebanese government. The explosion not only resulted in significant loss of life and property but also intensified public outcry against the ruling class, which has been accused of neglect and incompetence. In response, the U.S. has increased its humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, aiming to alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people while also advocating for structural reforms to address the root causes of the crisis.

In terms of security, the U.S. remains concerned about Hezbollah's influence and its role as a non-state actor within Lebanon. The group's military capabilities and its ties to Iran have raised alarms regarding regional stability. The U.S. has sought to counter this influence by supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as a legitimate security force capable of maintaining order and resisting sectarianism. However, the effectiveness of this support is often undermined by the political challenges and deep-seated divisions within Lebanon itself.

The economic crisis has led to a humanitarian emergency, with many Lebanese citizens struggling to access basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare. The U.S. has responded by providing emergency assistance and supporting international efforts to mobilize aid for the Lebanese people. However, without a commitment from the Lebanese government to implement necessary reforms, any aid provided may only serve as a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution. The U.S. must continue to pressure the Lebanese leadership to take meaningful actions towards accountability and governance reform.

Looking toward the future, Lebanon stands at a crossroads. The potential for increased civil unrest, violence, and regional spillover effects remains high if the underlying issues are not addressed. The U.S. can play a pivotal role in facilitating dialogue among Lebanese factions, encouraging political reforms, and fostering economic recovery. A comprehensive approach that combines humanitarian assistance, diplomatic engagement, and support for governance reforms will be essential for stabilizing Lebanon and promoting a more secure and prosperous future for its citizens.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Lebanon has historically contributed to U.S. strategic interests in various ways, including its role as a frontline state in countering Iranian influence in the region. The U.S. has supported the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which is viewed as a stabilizing force in a country beset by sectarian tensions and the threat of extremist groups. The LAF's ability to maintain security and prevent the rise of non-state actors like Hezbollah is crucial for U.S. interests in promoting stability in the Middle East. Moving forward, the U.S. would like to see greater military cooperation and support for the LAF, enhancing its capabilities to address internal security challenges.

In addition to security cooperation, Lebanon can aid U.S. efforts in counterterrorism. The country has faced threats from various extremist groups, and its unique position as a melting pot of cultures offers insights into the dynamics of radicalization and recruitment. The U.S. expects Lebanon to continue sharing intelligence and cooperating on counterterrorism initiatives, which could include joint training exercises and information-sharing agreements.

The U.S. would also like Lebanon to strengthen its commitment to democratic reforms and good governance. By fostering a more transparent and accountable political system, Lebanon can serve as a model for other countries in the region, aligning with U.S. interests in promoting democratic values and stability. This would involve a commitment from Lebanese leaders to implement reforms that address corruption and enhance citizen participation in the political process.

### **What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Lebanon requires substantial support from the U.S. and the international community to address its pressing domestic challenges. One of the most critical areas where U.S. assistance can make a difference is in economic diversification. With a heavy reliance on remittances and a struggling economy, Lebanon needs help in developing sectors such as agriculture, technology, and tourism. U.S. investments in these areas could stimulate growth and create job opportunities, helping to alleviate the severe unemployment crisis.

Furthermore, Lebanon's public services have been severely compromised due to the economic crisis, leading to deteriorating healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The U.S. can assist in rebuilding these essential services by providing financial aid, technical support, and expertise. Collaborating on projects that focus on improving public health systems, educational opportunities, and infrastructure development can foster long-term stability and resilience.

The Lebanese government also needs support in implementing governance reforms that enhance transparency and accountability. The U.S. can play a critical role by promoting initiatives that strengthen civil society organizations and support independent media. This would help create an environment that encourages citizen participation and holds government officials accountable for their actions.

Overall, Lebanon's needs align with U.S. foreign policy goals of promoting stability, security, and democratic governance in the region. By providing targeted assistance and encouraging structural reforms, the U.S. can help Lebanon navigate its current challenges and pave the way for a more prosperous and stable future.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Lebanon is a small, yet strategically located country in the eastern Mediterranean, bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. It has a diverse population of approximately 6 million people, composed of various religious and ethnic groups, predominantly Christians and Muslims. Lebanon's economy has historically relied on sectors such as banking, tourism, and agriculture; however, the ongoing economic crisis has severely impacted these industries. The country has a GDP of approximately $33 billion, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. The quality of life in Lebanon has deteriorated rapidly due to the economic collapse, with the World Bank estimating that over 70% of the population is now living in poverty. Lebanon currently scores poorly on freedom indexes, reflecting issues related to governance, human rights, and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Middle East makes it a critical player in regional stability. The country has historically been a battleground for various geopolitical interests, particularly between Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah, and Israel. Lebanon's political stance and alliances impact the broader dynamics of the region, particularly in terms of counterterrorism efforts and the containment of extremist groups. The U.S. has a vested interest in ensuring that Lebanon remains a sovereign state free from external influence, particularly from Iran, as this would contribute to greater stability in the Middle East.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Lebanon is characterized by sectarian divisions and a complex power-sharing system that often leads to gridlock and inefficiency. The ruling political class, which includes various sectarian leaders, has faced widespread criticism for corruption and mismanagement. While there are formal democratic structures in place, actual governance practices often fall short of democratic ideals. The current ruling party is a coalition of various sectarian groups, including Hezbollah, which exerts significant influence over the government. This has created challenges for governance and has hindered the ability to implement necessary reforms.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S. has had a complex relationship with Lebanon, marked by significant events such as the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), U.S. military interventions, and the ongoing struggle against Hezbollah.

### **4. Policy Goals**

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Lebanon can assist the U.S. in achieving its regional goals by continuing to strengthen its security forces, particularly the Lebanese Armed Forces, to counter the influence of Hezbollah and extremist groups. Past contributions, such as intelligence sharing and military cooperation, have been beneficial, and the U.S. seeks to enhance this support. Future collaboration could involve joint training programs and assistance in countering terrorism, further aligning Lebanon's security objectives with U.S. interests in the region.

Additionally, Lebanon has the potential to serve as a model for democratic governance and reform in the Middle East. The U.S. would like to see Lebanon take concrete steps toward implementing reforms that promote transparency, accountability, and citizen participation. By fostering a more democratic political environment, Lebanon can contribute to regional stability and serve as an example for neighboring countries.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Lebanon requires substantial support from the U.S. and the international community to address its pressing domestic challenges. This includes economic assistance aimed at stabilizing the economy, enhancing public services, and supporting governance reforms. The U.S. can play a critical role by providing technical assistance and facilitating investments that promote economic diversification and growth.

Concrete Policy Proposal:  
The U.S. should propose a comprehensive support package for Lebanon that includes humanitarian aid, economic assistance, and technical support for governance reforms. This package should prioritize initiatives that strengthen the LAF, promote democratic governance, and address urgent humanitarian needs.

**Diplomatic Objectives:**

The U.S. must focus on strengthening alliances with Lebanon while managing adversarial relationships with regional actors such as Iran and Hezbollah. Promoting democratic values, human rights, and good governance should be at the forefront of U.S. diplomatic efforts in Lebanon.

**Economic Strategies:**

Expanding mutually beneficial trade and investment opportunities is essential for Lebanon's recovery. The U.S. should work to create trade agreements that stimulate growth in key sectors and encourage sustainable development practices.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**  
Lebanon's healthcare system has been severely impacted by the economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Assessing Lebanon's public health infrastructure and supporting initiatives for vaccine distribution and healthcare capacity building will be crucial for addressing ongoing health challenges. U.S. collaboration can involve providing technical assistance, resources, and support for health initiatives to strengthen Lebanon's public health system.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**  
Lebanon hosts a significant number of refugees, particularly from Syria, which has strained its resources and social services. The U.S. should work collaboratively with Lebanon to address this humanitarian crisis, providing support for refugee integration and assistance for local communities. Strengthening border management and addressing migration challenges will also be essential for maintaining stability in the region.

**Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:**  
Assessing levels of corruption and promoting good governance are critical for Lebanon's recovery. The U.S. should support initiatives that enhance judicial independence, strengthen anti-corruption measures, and promote transparency within key institutions. These efforts will foster a more robust partnership with the U.S. and enhance Lebanon's stability.

**Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:**  
Lebanon's role within regional organizations and international agreements is vital for addressing shared challenges. The U.S. should encourage Lebanon's participation in multilateral efforts aimed at promoting stability, security, and economic recovery in the region.

**Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:**  
While political governance is critical, addressing broader social justice issues such as labor rights, gender equality, and the rights of marginalized communities is equally important. The U.S. should advocate for policies that promote social justice and human rights, fostering a more inclusive and stable society in Lebanon.

**Tariff report:**

Lebanon's tariffs on U.S. imports are relatively moderate, but trade barriers can still be present in certain sectors. Efforts to reduce tariffs and facilitate trade agreements could enhance U.S.-Lebanon economic relations.

**Immigration to USA report:**

Lebanon has seen a significant number of its citizens migrate to the U.S. for economic opportunities and education. U.S. immigration policies should consider the needs of Lebanese migrants and facilitate pathways for legal immigration.

**Visa requirements for US citizens to visit:**

U.S. citizens can visit Lebanon for tourism, but they must obtain a visa prior to arrival. The visa application process requires documentation and can take several weeks. Promoting easier travel for U.S. citizens can enhance cultural exchange and strengthen ties between the two nations.
