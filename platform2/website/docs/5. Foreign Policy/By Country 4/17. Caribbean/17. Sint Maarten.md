# **Sint Maarten: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Sint Maarten, a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, share a cooperative relationship focused on economic ties (primarily tourism), regional security cooperation (counter-narcotics, border security), and disaster resilience. Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Sint Maarten shares an island with the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin. As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its foreign and defense policies are ultimately Kingdom responsibilities, but it possesses autonomy in most internal affairs. U.S. engagement is managed through the U.S. Consulate General in Curaçao. Current relations are **positive and centered on economic links, law enforcement cooperation, and post-hurricane recovery/resilience efforts**, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The U.S. values Sint Maarten as a stable, democratic partner in the Caribbean.

### **Crises**

Sint Maarten faces significant challenges related to its vulnerability as a small island developing state. The most profound recent crisis was the **catastrophic impact of Hurricane Irma** in September 2017, which destroyed or damaged the vast majority of the island's infrastructure, devastated the crucial tourism economy, and caused a major humanitarian crisis. Recovery and reconstruction efforts, supported by the Netherlands and international partners (including the World Bank Trust Fund financed by the Netherlands), are ongoing but face challenges related to capacity, governance, and building long-term resilience.

Economically, Sint Maarten's extreme **dependence on tourism** (particularly cruise ship arrivals and stay-over visitors, many from the U.S.) makes it highly vulnerable to external shocks like hurricanes, pandemics (COVID-19 severely impacted tourism), or global economic downturns. Diversifying the economy is a major long-term challenge for the small island.

Environmentally, Sint Maarten is highly vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, including **sea-level rise**, coastal erosion, and increased **hurricane intensity**. Protecting its natural environment, crucial for tourism, while managing development pressures (e.g., waste management on a small island) is an ongoing challenge.

Regionally, Sint Maarten's location makes it potentially vulnerable to **transnational crime**, including narcotics trafficking and human smuggling using Caribbean routes. Cooperation with French Saint-Martin on border management and law enforcement is essential but can be complex.

Anticipated future crises primarily revolve around **natural disasters** (hurricanes) potentially becoming more frequent/intense due to climate change. **Economic shocks** affecting tourism remain a constant risk. Ensuring effective **governance and capacity** to manage recovery funds, implement resilience measures, and address social needs post-Irma are critical challenges.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Sint Maarten's contributions to U.S. regional goals are primarily in the areas of **regional security cooperation and economic partnership**. Through its participation (via the Kingdom of the Netherlands) in regional security frameworks, Sint Maarten cooperates with U.S. law enforcement agencies (DEA, CBP, Coast Guard) on **counter-narcotics** efforts, leveraging its location and major port/airport facilities (Princess Juliana International Airport - SXM, a regional hub). Cooperation with French authorities on the shared island also contributes to border security and combating illicit flows. As a stable democracy within the Dutch Kingdom, Sint Maarten contributes to overall **Caribbean stability**. Its significant **tourism industry**, heavily reliant on U.S. visitors and cruise lines, fosters strong economic and people-to-people links, supporting U.S. economic interests in the region. Its experience in **disaster recovery and resilience building** following Hurricane Irma could potentially offer lessons for other small island states in the Caribbean, aligning with U.S. goals of promoting regional resilience.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Sint Maarten's continued strong cooperation (via the Netherlands) on **counter-narcotics, counter-trafficking, and border security**, including information sharing and potentially enhanced operational coordination. Strengthening **anti-money laundering (AML)** frameworks related to its tourism and potentially financial sectors is important. Continued effective **disaster preparedness and resilience building**, potentially sharing lessons learned, supports regional stability. As a major tourism hub, cooperation on **aviation and maritime security standards** is also valuable. Concrete actions could involve Sint Maarten enhancing its port/airport security measures (with Dutch/U.S. support), proactively sharing information on illicit activities, and participating actively in regional disaster management exercises. Accountability is maintained through U.S.-Kingdom of Netherlands dialogues, specific law enforcement cooperation channels, and regional security/disaster management forums.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Sint Maarten's primary needs from the U.S. and the international community center on support for **disaster recovery, resilience building, economic stability, and security cooperation**. Following Hurricane Irma, a critical need remains for continued support (financial and technical) for **reconstruction and building resilience** to future disasters. This includes assistance for rebuilding critical infrastructure (hospital, airport, utilities, housing) to higher standards, implementing climate adaptation measures (coastal protection, resilient building codes), and strengthening disaster preparedness/response capacity. Support from the Netherlands (via the World Bank Trust Fund) is primary, but U.S. technical expertise (e.g., from FEMA, NOAA, USAID disaster specialists) and potentially targeted project support could be valuable.

Economically, Sint Maarten needs continued **strong tourism flows**, especially from the U.S. market. Support for **sustainable tourism** practices and potentially limited **economic diversification** efforts (e.g., in yachting services, regional transport/logistics given SXM airport hub role) would enhance resilience. Technical assistance for improving public financial management and governance capacity, particularly related to managing recovery funds transparently and effectively, is also needed.

In security, Sint Maarten needs continued **international cooperation (U.S., Netherlands, France, regional partners) on counter-narcotics, counter-trafficking, and border security**. This includes intelligence sharing, technical assistance, training for local law enforcement, and operational support from partners like the U.S. Coast Guard and the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Support for managing potential **migration-related challenges** humanely and effectively is also relevant. Given its extreme vulnerability, access to international **climate finance** and technology for **climate adaptation and renewable energy** development is a crucial long-term need.
