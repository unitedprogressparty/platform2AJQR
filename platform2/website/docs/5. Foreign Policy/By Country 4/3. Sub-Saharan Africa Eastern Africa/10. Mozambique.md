# Mozambique: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis

---

### Preface

The relationship between the United States and Mozambique has evolved significantly over the years, particularly following Mozambique's transition to democracy in the early 1990s. Recent events, including Mozambique's struggle with insurgency in the northern Cabo Delgado province, have drawn international attention, including from the U.S. government, which is keen on ensuring regional stability. The U.S. has been involved in supporting Mozambique through various forms of assistance, including military training to combat the insurgency and economic support aimed at bolstering governance and development.

### Crises:

Mozambique is currently facing a significant crisis due to the ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado, which has resulted in violent clashes between government forces and Islamist insurgents. This conflict has caused the displacement of over 800,000 people, leading to a humanitarian crisis marked by food insecurity and inadequate basic services. The insurgency, which began in 2017, has not only threatened local stability but has potential implications for regional security, drawing in neighboring countries and international actors.

In addition to the insurgency, Mozambique is dealing with the aftereffects of Cyclone Idai, which devastated parts of the country in 2019. The cyclone caused widespread destruction, exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities and hindering recovery efforts. While recovery initiatives have been underway, the situation remains precarious, with the risk of future natural disasters due to climate change.

Looking to the future, Mozambique faces the risk of increased violence and instability if the insurgency continues unchecked. There are also concerns regarding the potential for the region's resources, particularly natural gas, to become a focal point for increased conflict, as different factions vie for control. The government's ability to manage these challenges effectively will be critical for maintaining domestic stability and fostering a conducive environment for foreign investment.

The region as a whole is characterized by various challenges, including poverty, political instability, and climate-related vulnerabilities. These issues not only affect Mozambique but also have broader implications for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the United States' strategic interests in the region.

**Frank Narrative**

Mozambique has long been a country of strategic interest for the United States, particularly with its rich natural resources, including natural gas and minerals. The U.S. views Mozambique as a potential partner in promoting regional stability and economic development in Southern Africa. However, the ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado poses significant risks to these aspirations. The U.S. is keen to support Mozambique in addressing these security challenges, as a stable Mozambique is essential for the broader stability of the region.

In recent years, Mozambique has made strides towards economic development, particularly with the discovery of substantial offshore natural gas reserves. The United States has an interest in these developments, as they align with U.S. energy security goals. However, the insurgency in Cabo Delgado threatens to derail these economic opportunities. The U.S. has provided limited military assistance to help Mozambique combat the insurgency, but a more comprehensive approach involving economic support and capacity building is necessary.

The U.S. also expects Mozambique to uphold democratic values and human rights as a condition for continued support. Mozambique's political landscape has been marked by challenges to governance, including allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. Strengthening democratic institutions and promoting good governance will not only enhance Mozambique's stability but also solidify the partnership with the United States.

Looking ahead, it is crucial for both the U.S. and Mozambique to work together to address the multifaceted challenges facing the country. By fostering a cooperative relationship that emphasizes security, economic development, and democratic governance, the U.S. can help Mozambique achieve its potential while furthering its own strategic interests in the region.
