---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Guyana has historically been characterized by cooperation in various sectors, including trade, security, and environmental conservation. Recently, the discovery of significant oil reserves in Guyana has intensified interest from the U.S. and other global powers. This newfound resource wealth has the potential to reshape the country's economy and its geopolitical significance in the region. The U.S. has supported Guyana in strengthening its democratic institutions, countering narcotics trafficking, and enhancing security capabilities, particularly given the backdrop of regional instability. Additionally, the U.S. has been involved in various developmental projects aimed at improving infrastructure and governance, reflecting a commitment to long-term partnership.

### **Crises**:

Guyana currently faces a series of crises that could impact its stability and relationship with the United States. The political landscape has been tumultuous, particularly following the contentious 2020 elections that led to allegations of electoral fraud and subsequent protests. The situation has somewhat stabilized, but lingering tensions pose risks for social cohesion. Furthermore, the region is experiencing challenges related to transnational crime, including drug trafficking and human trafficking, which also affect U.S. interests in maintaining security and stability. As Guyana develops its oil industry, concerns about environmental degradation and the impact on indigenous communities have emerged, potentially leading to domestic unrest and international scrutiny.

In the broader context, the Caribbean region faces escalating threats from climate change, which exacerbates vulnerabilities in small island nations and coastal areas. Guyana, with its low-lying geography, is particularly susceptible to rising sea levels and extreme weather events. As the U.S. and Guyana navigate their relationship, these environmental challenges will require cooperative strategies to ensure resilience. Moreover, the geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in Latin America and the Caribbean introduces an additional layer of complexity, as Guyana's strategic positioning may attract external influences that could undermine U.S. interests.

The ongoing tensions with neighboring Venezuela over border disputes and resource claims have persisted for decades, creating a potential flashpoint for conflict. Guyana's oil discoveries have escalated these tensions, as Venezuela's claims to parts of Guyana's territory may lead to increased military posturing or diplomatic confrontations. The U.S. can play a crucial role in supporting Guyana's sovereignty through diplomatic channels and security assistance, thereby reinforcing its strategic partnership in the region.

In summary, Guyana is at a crossroads, facing both opportunities and challenges that will shape its future. The U.S. must navigate these dynamics carefully to promote stability and ensure that Guyana remains a reliable partner in addressing shared regional challenges.

**Frank Narrative** 

Guyana's strategic location on the northeastern coast of South America makes it an important partner for the United States, particularly in the context of regional security and energy security. The U.S. has a vested interest in supporting Guyana's efforts to develop its vast oil reserves, which have the potential to significantly boost the country’s economy and provide a stable energy source. Historically, Guyana has been an ally in U.S. counter-narcotics efforts, working collaboratively to combat drug trafficking and strengthen law enforcement capabilities. This cooperation has been essential in addressing the broader implications of drug-related violence that can destabilize the region.

As Guyana continues to develop its oil industry, the U.S. should expect the country to leverage its newfound wealth to enhance its military capabilities and regional influence. This development presents an opportunity for the U.S. to engage in military cooperation, including joint exercises and training programs, which can foster deeper ties and promote stability. Additionally, by providing technical assistance and investment in sustainable energy initiatives, the U.S. can help Guyana diversify its economy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, reinforcing a shared commitment to combatting climate change.

In terms of future collaboration, the U.S. must also advocate for strong governance and democratic practices in Guyana. The political turmoil following the last elections highlighted the fragility of democratic institutions, which could undermine U.S. interests if not addressed. By supporting civil society initiatives and promoting transparent electoral processes, the U.S. can help strengthen democratic norms in Guyana, ensuring that it remains a reliable partner in the region. Moreover, a stable political environment will be crucial for attracting foreign investment, which is essential for Guyana's economic growth.

Guyana can play an instrumental role in assisting the United States in achieving its regional goals of promoting peace, security, and democracy in South America. As tensions with Venezuela persist and external influences seek to undermine U.S. interests, a robust partnership with Guyana will be critical in navigating these challenges. The U.S. must prioritize dialogue, cooperation, and mutual support to ensure that both nations can thrive in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Guyana has historically contributed to U.S. strategic interests through its participation in counterterrorism and anti-drug trafficking initiatives. The country has cooperated closely with U.S. law enforcement and military agencies to address transnational crime, enhancing regional security. In the future, the U.S. would like to see Guyana take a more active role in regional security alliances, such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and participate in joint military exercises that enhance collective security measures. The U.S. could facilitate this by providing training and resources to improve Guyana's defense capabilities and operational readiness.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Guyana requires support in several key areas to address its domestic challenges. Economic diversification is essential, as reliance on oil revenues can lead to volatility and dependence on global oil markets. The U.S. can assist by promoting investments in technology and infrastructure, helping Guyana develop sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and renewable energy. Additionally, the U.S. can provide technical assistance in governance and institutional capacity building, ensuring that democratic practices are upheld and corruption is addressed.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Guyana is located on the northern coast of South America, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Venezuela to the west, and Brazil to the south. The country has a population of approximately 790,000 and a diverse cultural landscape influenced by Indigenous, African, East Indian, and European heritage. The GDP of Guyana was estimated at $6.2 billion in 2021, with significant growth anticipated due to its burgeoning oil sector, which is projected to contribute up to 30% of GDP in the coming years. The quality of life in Guyana varies, with urban areas like Georgetown experiencing better access to services compared to rural regions. The Freedom House index ranks Guyana as “partly free,” reflecting ongoing challenges to democratic governance and the rule of law.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**
