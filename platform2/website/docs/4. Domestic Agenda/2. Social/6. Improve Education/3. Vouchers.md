## Protecting Public Education by Prohibiting Private School Vouchers

Public education is a cornerstone of American democracy, intended to provide equitable opportunity for all children, regardless of background or zip code. Private school voucher programs, which divert public taxpayer dollars to subsidize tuition at private and religious schools, fundamentally undermine this principle. They drain critical resources from already underfunded public schools, exacerbate segregation, lack accountability, and often fail to deliver on promises of improved educational outcomes.

Our platform calls for a complete **ban on the use of public funds for private school vouchers** at the federal, state, and local levels. We believe public money must be invested in strengthening public schools to serve all students, not subsidizing private institutions that are often unaccountable to the public.

### Rationale for Banning Public Funds for Private Schools:

1.  **Undermining Public Schools:** Voucher programs siphon essential funding away from public school districts, reducing their capacity to serve the vast majority of students, particularly those with the greatest needs (e.g., students with disabilities, English language learners, low-income students). This disinvestment harms public education quality for everyone.

2.  **Exacerbating Segregation and Inequality:** Private schools are not required to accept all students and can discriminate based on religion, disability, LGBTQ+ status, or academic performance. Vouchers disproportionately benefit families who can already afford private school costs (as vouchers rarely cover full tuition) and often lead to increased racial and socioeconomic segregation, counter to the goal of integrated, equitable public education.

3.  **Lack of Accountability and Transparency:** Private schools receiving voucher funds are typically exempt from the public accountability standards required of public schools, including standardized testing, curriculum transparency, teacher certification requirements, and financial oversight. Public dollars should not flow to institutions that operate without public accountability.

4.  **No Proven Educational Benefit:** Decades of research show that voucher programs generally do not produce significant improvements in student academic achievement compared to public schools. In some cases, students using vouchers have performed worse academically. Public investment should focus on evidence-based strategies within the public system.

5.  **Violation of Separation of Church and State:** Many voucher programs channel public funds to religious schools, raising serious constitutional concerns about the entanglement of government and religion and potentially funding institutions that discriminate based on religious beliefs.

### Policy Actions:

*   **Federal Legislation:** Enact federal legislation prohibiting the use of any federal funds for private school voucher programs and incentivize states to end their own voucher schemes.
*   **Redirect Funds:** Ensure that any funds previously allocated to voucher programs are reinvested directly into public schools, prioritizing districts with high needs to improve teacher salaries, reduce class sizes, update resources, and expand support services.
*   **Strengthen Public School Choice:** Support and expand legitimate public school choice options, such as magnet schools, charter schools (with strong public oversight and accountability), and inter-district transfer programs, that operate within the public system and are open to all students.

### Conclusion:

Investing in strong, equitable, and accountable public schools is the most effective way to ensure educational opportunity for all children. Private school vouchers are a failed policy experiment that undermines public education, exacerbates inequality, and lacks accountability. We must end the diversion of public funds to private institutions and recommit to supporting the public school system that serves as the foundation of our democracy.
