## title: \" 2. End Mass Incarceration\"

## **Federal Decarceration and Community Empowerment Act (FDCEA)**

### **Preamble**

Recognizing that mass incarceration has contributed to significant
social, economic, and racial disparities, and that the current reliance
on punitive confinement is unsustainable, this Act aims to:

-   **Gradually reduce and repurpose federal and state incarceration
    facilities.**

-   **Decriminalize a range of nonviolent, low-level offenses.**

-   **Eliminate mandatory punitive sentencing for nonviolent crimes.**

-   **Reallocate federal resources to support community safety
    initiatives and local governance.**

-   **Establish robust oversight mechanisms to ensure equity,
    transparency, and accountability.**

### **Title I: Phased Reduction and Transformation of Incarceration Facilities**

**Section 101. Facility Review and Closure Plan**

-   **(a) Comprehensive Facility Audit:\
    ** Within one year of enactment, the Department of Justice (DOJ)
    shall commission an independent audit of all federal correctional
    facilities to assess:

    -   Occupancy rates relative to national benchmarks for nonviolent
        offenders.

    -   The proportion of inmates incarcerated for low-level offenses.

    -   The physical and fiscal costs of maintaining overcapacity
        facilities.

-   **(b) Phased Closure Mandate:\
    ** Based on audit findings, a phased closure or repurposing schedule
    will be established for facilities where incarceration is deemed
    disproportionate. Priority will be given to facilities primarily
    housing nonviolent, low-level offenders.

-   **(c) Sunset Provision for Incarceration Policies:\
    ** Legislation will include sunset clauses for mandatory sentencing
    laws and policies that contribute to over-incarceration. These
    clauses will trigger biennial reviews and require legislative
    renewal only if continued use of incarceration is demonstrably
    necessary for public safety.

### **Title II: Broad Decriminalization and Rebalancing Public Safety**

**Section 201. Selective Decriminalization of Nonviolent Offenses**

-   **(a) Federal Decriminalization Guidelines:\
    ** The Attorney General, in consultation with experts in criminal
    justice and community leaders, shall develop guidelines for
    decriminalizing:

    -   Minor property offenses.

    -   Low-level drug possession (excluding offenses associated with
        violent drug trafficking).

    -   Nonviolent public order offenses.

-   **(b) State Incentive Program:\
    ** A federal grant program will be established to incentivize states
    that align their statutes with these guidelines. Grants will support
    local jurisdictions in adapting court processes and administrative
    systems to manage decriminalized offenses without resorting to
    incarceration.

**Section 202. Demilitarization and Reallocation of Law Enforcement
Resources**

-   **(a) Limiting Use-of-Force Mandates:\
    ** Amendments to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
    shall restrict the use of military-grade equipment and tactics for
    enforcing low-level offenses.

-   **(b) Funding Reallocation:\
    ** A minimum of 15% of federal funding for law enforcement will be
    reallocated to support community policing initiatives, including the
    development of local safety councils and community accountability
    panels.

### **Title III: Elimination of Mandatory Punitive Sentencing**

**Section 301. Repeal of Mandatory Minimums for Nonviolent Offenses**

-   **(a) Legislative Repeal:\
    ** All federal laws mandating minimum incarceration terms for
    nonviolent offenses shall be repealed. Courts shall be provided with
    guidelines that favor non-custodial responses where public safety is
    not compromised.

-   **(b) Judicial Discretion Enhancement:\
    ** Federal sentencing guidelines will be revised to empower judges
    to impose alternative forms of supervision or community-based
    sanctions instead of incarceration, ensuring proportionality and
    context-specific decisions.

**Section 302. Introduction of Conditional Non-Custodial Alternatives**

-   **(a) Risk Assessment Protocols:\
    ** The Bureau of Justice Assistance shall develop standardized risk
    assessment protocols to determine when non-custodial measures are
    appropriate. These protocols will consider factors such as the
    severity of the offense, the offender's history, and community
    impact.

-   **(b) Implementation Grants:\
    ** A grant program will be established to assist federal courts and
    probation departments in adopting non-custodial measures, including
    community service orders, electronic monitoring where necessary, and
    mandatory participation in restorative justice circles (without
    framing these as rehabilitation programs).

### **Title IV: Reinvestment in Community Empowerment**

**Section 401. Community Reinvestment and Safety Initiatives**

-   **(a) Establishment of Community Safety Councils:\
    ** Each state shall be required to establish locally elected
    Community Safety Councils. These councils will:

    -   Facilitate mediation and conflict resolution.

    -   Serve as advisory bodies to local governments on public safety
        strategies.

    -   Oversee the implementation of community-based accountability
        measures.

-   **(b) Federal Funding for Community Infrastructure:\
    ** At least 10% of funds reallocated from incarceration and law
    enforcement budgets will be directed to:

    -   Upgrading public education and vocational training programs.

    -   Expanding local governance capacities.

    -   Supporting community centers and local development projects
        aimed at reducing the social determinants of crime.

**Section 402. Accountability and Oversight**

-   **(a) Creation of a Federal Oversight Commission:\
    ** A Federal Decarceration and Community Empowerment Commission
    (FDCEC) shall be established. Its responsibilities will include:

    -   Monitoring the implementation of this Act.

    -   Collecting and publishing annual data on incarceration trends,
        funding reallocations, and the performance of community safety
        initiatives.

    -   Conducting impact assessments and making recommendations for
        policy adjustments.

-   **(b) Public Reporting Requirements:\
    ** The FDCEC shall publish a comprehensive report every year
    detailing:

    -   The progress of facility audits and closures.

    -   The impact of decriminalization measures on arrest rates.

    -   Changes in sentencing patterns at the federal level.

    -   Community feedback and outcomes from safety council initiatives.

### **Title V: Implementation, Review, and Sunset Provisions**

**Section 501. Implementation Timeline**

-   **(a) Immediate Implementation:\
    ** Provisions within Titles I--IV shall commence immediately upon
    enactment, with key actions (such as the facility audit and the
    establishment of decriminalization guidelines) to be completed
    within 12 months.

-   **(b) Staggered Reforms:\
    ** More complex measures, including the full reallocation of law
    enforcement funds and the establishment of Community Safety
    Councils, shall be implemented on a staggered timeline over the
    following 3--5 years.

**Section 502. Sunset Clauses and Mandatory Reviews**

-   **(a) Biennial Reviews:\
    ** Each section of this Act shall be subject to a biennial review by
    the FDCEC, with findings submitted to Congress and made available to
    the public.

-   **(b) Sunset Provisions:\
    ** Certain punitive measures, such as mandatory incarceration for
    nonviolent offenses, will automatically sunset unless actively
    renewed by Congress, ensuring that the Act's reforms are maintained
    only as long as they prove effective and necessary.

### **Conclusion**

The Federal Decarceration and Community Empowerment Act represents a
bold, yet pragmatic approach to reforming our nation's justice system.
By gradually reducing reliance on incarceration, decriminalizing
low-level offenses, eliminating mandatory punitive sentencing, and
reinvesting in community safety, this Act seeks to address the root
causes of mass incarceration. It emphasizes accountability, local
empowerment, and transparency, providing a clear roadmap for building a
more equitable and community-centered approach to public safety---one
that recognizes that true security is achieved not through confinement
but through the active participation and empowerment of local
communities.
