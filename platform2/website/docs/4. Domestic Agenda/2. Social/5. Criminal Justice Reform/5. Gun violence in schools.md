## Creating Safe Learning Environments Through Comprehensive Prevention

The epidemic of gun violence tragically extends into our nation's schools, shattering lives and creating pervasive fear within communities that should be sanctuaries for learning and growth. Addressing gun violence in schools requires a comprehensive, evidence-based public health approach that moves beyond reactive security measures and tackles the root causes of violence while implementing common-sense gun safety reforms.

We reject simplistic solutions like arming teachers, which only introduce more firearms into schools and fail to address underlying issues. Instead, our platform focuses on proactive prevention strategies that foster safe, supportive school climates and limit access to dangerous weapons.

### Key Strategies for Preventing School Gun Violence:

1.  **Invest in School-Based Mental Health Services:**
    *   Dramatically increase funding for school counselors, psychologists, and social workers to ensure students have access to comprehensive mental health support. (See also section 6.4.6 School-Based Mental Health Services).
    *   Implement universal mental health screenings and early intervention programs to identify and support students in crisis before violence occurs.
    *   Promote positive school climates through social-emotional learning (SEL) programs and anti-bullying initiatives.

2.  **Implement Common-Sense Gun Safety Legislation:**
    *   Enact universal background checks for all gun sales, closing loopholes that allow prohibited individuals to acquire firearms.
    *   Pass federal Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO or "red flag") laws to allow temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others by a court.
    *   Mandate secure firearm storage in homes to prevent unauthorized access by children and adolescents.
    *   Reinstate and strengthen the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, weapons designed for mass casualties. (Note: Balance with broader gun rights considerations outlined in section 2.8).

3.  **Support Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs:**
    *   Invest in evidence-based CVI programs that use trusted community members to mediate conflicts, interrupt cycles of violence, and connect at-risk individuals with support services *before* violence escalates and potentially spills into schools.

4.  **Threat Assessment Programs:**
    *   Fund the development and implementation of school-based multidisciplinary threat assessment teams trained to identify, evaluate, and manage potential threats of violence in a non-discriminatory manner, focusing on intervention and support rather than solely punitive measures.

5.  **Responsible School Safety Measures (Non-Militarized):**
    *   Focus on proven physical security measures like access control (single point of entry), visitor management systems, and internal locking mechanisms, rather than overly militarized approaches.
    *   Ensure safety plans are developed collaboratively with students, parents, educators, mental health professionals, and law enforcement, emphasizing prevention and de-escalation.

### Conclusion:

Preventing gun violence in schools requires a holistic strategy that combines robust mental health support, common-sense gun safety laws, community-based prevention efforts, and responsible safety planning. By treating school gun violence as a public health crisis and investing in comprehensive, evidence-based solutions, we can create safer learning environments where all students and educators can thrive without fear.
