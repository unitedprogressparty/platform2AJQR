# Gas Extraction

## Philosophy and Vision
We recognize the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, including natural gas, to combat climate change and build a sustainable energy future. While acknowledging the current role of natural gas in the energy mix, our vision is to phase out its extraction and use, prioritizing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. We aim to implement policies that immediately halt the expansion of gas extraction and manage the decline of existing operations responsibly, ensuring a just transition for workers and communities dependent on the gas industry.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
The extraction and burning of natural gas contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, a potent climate pollutant. Fracking, a common method of gas extraction, poses risks to water resources, air quality, and seismic stability. Continued investment in new gas infrastructure locks in fossil fuel dependence for decades. The existing note calls for a moratorium on new permits.

**Solutions:**
- **Implement a Moratorium on New Gas Extraction Permits:** Immediately halt the issuance of new permits for natural gas exploration and extraction, including fracking, on federal lands and waters. This directly addresses the existing note.
- **Phase Out Existing Gas Extraction:** Develop a clear timeline and plan for the phased reduction and eventual cessation of natural gas extraction, aligned with climate science goals.
- **Invest Heavily in Renewable Energy:** Redirect investments and subsidies from fossil fuels to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal, and invest in grid modernization and energy storage.
- **Support a Just Transition:** Create comprehensive programs to support workers and communities currently reliant on the gas industry, including job training for clean energy sectors, wage support, and community economic diversification initiatives.
- **Strengthen Regulations on Existing Operations:** Implement stricter regulations on existing gas extraction operations to minimize methane leaks, water pollution, and other environmental impacts.
- **End Subsidies for Fossil Fuels:** Eliminate federal tax breaks and subsidies for the natural gas industry.
- **Promote Energy Efficiency and Conservation:** Invest in programs and incentives to improve energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry, reducing overall demand for energy, including natural gas.

## Outcome
Implementing these policies will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the environmental and health impacts of gas extraction, and accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. It will ensure a more stable climate, cleaner air and water, and create new economic opportunities in the renewable energy sector, while providing support for communities affected by the transition away from fossil fuels.
