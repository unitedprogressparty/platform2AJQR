# Child Protections

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that childhood is a critical period for development, learning, and well-being, free from the burdens and hazards of premature labor. Protecting children from exploitation in the workplace is a moral imperative and essential for their healthy growth and future potential. Our vision is a society where every child is safe, nurtured, and has the opportunity to thrive without being subjected to harmful or exploitative work, including in industries like entertainment.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
Despite existing laws, child labor persists in various forms, often driven by economic hardship, inadequate enforcement, and loopholes in regulations. Children, including those in the entertainment industry, can be vulnerable to long hours, hazardous conditions, and negative impacts on their education and development.

**Solutions:**
- **Strengthen and Strictly Enforce Child Labor Laws:** Close loopholes in existing federal and state child labor laws and significantly increase funding for enforcement agencies to conduct rigorous inspections and prosecute violations.
- **End Child Labor in All Sectors:** Explicitly prohibit child labor in all industries, including agriculture and domestic work, where exceptions may currently exist.
- **Address Exploitation of Child Entertainers:** Implement comprehensive regulations specifically for child performers and entertainers to ensure their working hours are limited, their education is protected, their earnings are safeguarded, and they are shielded from exploitation and hazardous environments.
- **Increase Penalties for Violators:** Impose severe penalties, including significant fines and criminal charges, on individuals and corporations that violate child labor laws.
- **Support Families to Prevent Economic Hardship:** Implement policies such as a strong social safety net, affordable childcare, and living wages for adults to reduce the economic pressures that can force families to rely on child labor.
- **Raise Public Awareness:** Conduct national campaigns to educate the public, parents, and employers about the harms of child labor and the importance of protecting children's rights.

## Outcome
Strengthened child protections will ensure that children are safe from exploitation and harm in the workplace, allowing them to focus on their education and development. This will lead to improved health and well-being for children, increased educational attainment, and a workforce that is better prepared for the future. Ending child labor is a crucial step towards building a just and equitable society for all.
