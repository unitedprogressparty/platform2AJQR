# Unions

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that strong labor unions are essential for a fair and equitable economy. Unions empower workers to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions, ensuring that the value they create is shared more equitably. Our vision is a future where the right to organize is fully protected and encouraged, leading to a more balanced distribution of power between employers and employees, increased worker safety, and a thriving middle class.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
Over decades, various legal and economic challenges have weakened the power of labor unions, leading to stagnant wages, reduced benefits, and precarious working conditions for many. Anti-union tactics by some employers and outdated labor laws have made it difficult for workers to organize and bargain effectively.

**Solutions:**
- **Pass the PRO Act (Protecting the Right to Organize Act):** Enact federal legislation that strengthens workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain, prevents employer interference in unionization efforts, and provides stronger enforcement mechanisms against unfair labor practices.
- **Repeal Right-to-Work Laws:** Support the repeal of state-level "right-to-work" laws that undermine union strength and collective bargaining power.
- **Facilitate Unionization in New Industries:** Update labor laws to make it easier for workers in emerging industries, including the gig economy and technology sectors, to form unions.
- **Strengthen Penalties for Union Busting:** Increase penalties for employers who violate workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively.
- **Promote Project Labor Agreements:** Encourage the use of project labor agreements on federal and federally funded construction projects to ensure fair wages and working conditions.
- **Support Public Sector Unions:** Protect and strengthen the rights of public sector employees to organize and bargain collectively.

## Outcome
Strengthening labor unions will lead to higher wages, improved benefits, and safer workplaces for millions of workers. It will help reduce income inequality, boost the purchasing power of the middle class, and contribute to a more stable and prosperous economy. Empowered workers will have a stronger voice in their workplaces, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity.
