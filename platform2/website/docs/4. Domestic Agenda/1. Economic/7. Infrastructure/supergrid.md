# Supergrid

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that a modern, resilient, and interconnected national energy grid is fundamental to powering our future economy, integrating renewable energy sources, and ensuring energy security. A "supergrid" utilizing advanced transmission technologies, including underground cables where appropriate, can efficiently transport clean energy from where it is generated to where it is needed, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing grid stability. Our vision is to build a 21st-century energy infrastructure that supports a clean energy transition, creates high-paying jobs, and provides reliable, affordable electricity to all Americans.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
The current energy grid is aging, vulnerable to extreme weather events and cyberattacks, and not adequately designed to handle the variable nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Siting and permitting for new transmission lines, particularly overhead lines, face significant challenges. The existing note mentions underground cables and job programs.

**Solutions:**
- **Invest in a National High-Capacity Supergrid:** Fund the planning, development, and construction of a national high-voltage direct current (HVDC) supergrid capable of transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances with minimal loss.
- **Prioritize Underground and Subsea Cables:** Where feasible and environmentally appropriate, prioritize the use of underground and subsea cables for new transmission lines to enhance resilience against weather events and reduce visual impact. This addresses the existing note about underground cables.
- **Streamline Permitting for Critical Transmission Infrastructure:** Reform permitting processes for nationally significant transmission projects to accelerate deployment while maintaining robust environmental and community review.
- **Integrate Renewable Energy Sources:** Design the supergrid to seamlessly integrate diverse renewable energy sources, enabling the efficient transmission of power from areas with abundant solar, wind, or geothermal resources to demand centers.
- **Create Green Jobs through Infrastructure Development:** Implement job training and apprenticeship programs specifically for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the supergrid and associated infrastructure, ensuring that this investment creates a significant number of good-paying jobs. This addresses the existing note about job programs.
- **Enhance Grid Security and Resilience:** Incorporate advanced technologies and design principles to protect the supergrid from physical and cyber threats and improve its ability to withstand and recover from disruptions.
- **Promote Interregional Cooperation:** Facilitate cooperation among regional grid operators to optimize the planning and operation of the national supergrid.

## Outcome
Building a national supergrid will accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. It will enhance grid reliability and resilience, lower energy costs for consumers by enabling access to the cheapest sources of renewable energy, and create a substantial number of skilled jobs in construction and energy sectors. This infrastructure investment is crucial for both environmental sustainability and long-term economic prosperity.
