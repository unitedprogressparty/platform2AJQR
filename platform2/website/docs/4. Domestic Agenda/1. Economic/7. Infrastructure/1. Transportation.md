# Transportation

## Philosophy and Vision
We believe that a modern, efficient, and sustainable transportation system is the backbone of a thriving economy and a connected society. Access to affordable and reliable transportation is essential for people to get to work, school, healthcare, and connect with their communities. Our vision is a transportation network that is safe, accessible to all, environmentally friendly, and supports economic growth while reducing congestion and pollution.

## Issues, Causes, and Solutions
The current transportation infrastructure in many areas is aging, congested, and overly reliant on fossil fuels. Public transportation options are often inadequate, particularly in rural and underserved areas. This leads to long commutes, increased pollution, and limited opportunities for those without access to personal vehicles.

**Solutions:**
- **Invest in Public Transportation:** Significantly increase federal investment in expanding and modernizing public transit systems, including buses, subways, light rail, and passenger rail, particularly in urban and suburban areas.
- **Develop High-Speed Rail:** Invest in the development of a national high-speed rail network to connect major cities, providing a fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to air and car travel.
- **Repair and Upgrade Existing Infrastructure:** Prioritize the repair and upgrade of existing roads, bridges, and railways to ensure safety and efficiency.
- **Promote Electric Vehicles and Charging Infrastructure:** Provide incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and invest heavily in building a national network of charging stations.
- **Support Active Transportation:** Invest in infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, such as bike lanes and walking paths, to promote healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation.
- **Develop Rural Transportation Solutions:** Implement innovative and flexible transportation solutions for rural areas, such as on-demand services and community-based transit programs.
- **Integrate Transportation and Land Use Planning:** Encourage coordinated planning between transportation development and land use to create walkable, transit-oriented communities.

## Outcome
Investing in a modern and sustainable transportation system will reduce commute times, lower transportation costs for individuals and families, and decrease air pollution and carbon emissions. It will create jobs, stimulate economic development, and improve access to opportunities for all Americans, leading to more connected, equitable, and environmentally sustainable communities.
