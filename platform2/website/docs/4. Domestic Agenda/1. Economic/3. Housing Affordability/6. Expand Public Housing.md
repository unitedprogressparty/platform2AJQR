## title: \" 6. Expand Public Housing\"

Got it! This policy will focus on fully **publicly owned and operated**
housing, ensuring that government assistance for rent does not funnel
money into private landlords\' pockets. Instead, it will create
**high-quality, publicly controlled housing** that remains permanently
affordable. Here's the revised version of the proposal:

# **The Affordable and Sustainable Public Housing Act (ASPHA)**

## **Executive Summary**

The Affordable and Sustainable Public Housing Act (ASPHA) is a bold
initiative to create **high-quality, publicly owned and operated
housing** to combat rising rents, reduce homelessness, and stabilize the
housing market. This policy ensures that government assistance directly
benefits tenants rather than private landlords by **eliminating the need
for Section 8-style subsidies** and instead investing in publicly
managed housing.

By establishing new, **well-designed, mixed-income public housing
developments**, ASPHA will provide long-term affordable options for
working-class and low-income families. The initiative will also
incorporate sustainable building practices and maintain government
oversight to **prevent gentrification and speculative price inflation.**

## **Policy Objectives**

1.  **Mass Public Housing Construction** -- Build **1 million new,
    publicly owned housing units** nationwide over the next 10 years.
    These units will be **non-privatized, permanently affordable, and
    exempt from market-driven rent hikes.**

2.  **Housing Stability & Affordability** -- Rent will be **capped at
    25% of a tenant's income** (or a fixed amount indexed to local
    wages), ensuring long-term affordability.

3.  **No Private Ownership or Management** -- The housing will be built
    with **union labor**, maintained by **public agencies**, and **kept
    under government control** to prevent privatization schemes.

4.  **Sustainability & Quality Design** -- Buildings will meet **green
    energy standards,** include community spaces, and be integrated into
    urban planning to **avoid the isolation seen in past public housing
    failures.**

5.  **Abolish Landlord Dependence** -- Government housing assistance
    will **no longer be funneled into private landlord profits** (like
    Section 8 vouchers) but instead **used to expand and maintain public
    housing stock.**

## **Implementation Plan**

1.  **Land Acquisition & Zoning Reform\
    **

    -   Use **vacant lots, unused government properties, and repurposed
        buildings** for public housing.

    -   Reform zoning laws to **allow high-density, mixed-use public
        housing in urban and suburban areas.**

2.  **Construction & Public Oversight\
    **

    -   Fund construction with **federal and state grants**---**no
        private developer ownership** allowed.

    -   Labor will be **union-based, with fair wages** and a focus on
        local job creation.

3.  **Tenant Control & Community Input\
    **

    -   Establish **tenant councils** to oversee management and ensure
        democratic input.

    -   **Mixed-income models** will be used to integrate working-class
        and low-income residents without segregation.

4.  **Sustainability & Long-Term Investment\
    **

    -   Buildings will include **solar panels, energy-efficient systems,
        and green spaces** to cut costs and support climate goals.

    -   Government maintenance teams will handle repairs to **ensure
        quality and avoid mismanagement.**

## **Why This Policy is Necessary**

-   **Current Affordable Housing Programs Are Broken** -- Section 8 and
    other rental assistance programs have **failed to keep up with
    demand,** with landlords **raising rents and rejecting low-income
    tenants.**

-   **Private Market Solutions Don't Work** -- Relying on the private
    sector to create "affordable housing" has led to **rent increases,
    gentrification, and predatory practices.**

-   **Public Housing Works** -- Successful models exist in countries
    like **Austria, Singapore, and Sweden**, where well-managed public
    housing provides long-term affordability and high living standards.

-   **Housing is a Human Right** -- No one should be at the mercy of
    landlords and market forces for basic shelter.

## **Advocacy & Public Support**

-   **Coalition Building** -- Work with **tenant unions, labor unions,
    progressive policymakers, and social justice groups** to push for
    mass public housing investment.

-   **Grassroots Mobilization** -- Organize **rallies, petitions, and
    local campaigns** to demand action from city, state, and federal
    governments.

-   **Debunk Public Housing Myths** -- Educate the public on how
    **modern, well-managed public housing is successful** and dismantle
    stigma around government-built housing.

## **Conclusion**

ASPHA is a **bold but necessary** step toward solving the housing
crisis. By **building high-quality public housing, removing landlords
from the equation, and keeping rents permanently affordable,** this
policy will ensure **stable, dignified housing for millions of people.**
