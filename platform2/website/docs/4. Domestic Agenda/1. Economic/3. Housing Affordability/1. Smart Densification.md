Here is a more concise and dense version of the Smart Densification
policy platform, retaining all topics and details while aiming for
brevity:

**Smart Densification: Concise Policy Platform for Equitable, Livable,
and Sustainable Communities**

**Executive Summary\
**Smart Densification addresses the housing affordability and urban
sprawl crisis by strategically increasing housing options within
existing urban areas. This platform, built on seven pillars---Zoning
Modernization, Strategic Infrastructure Investment, Affordable Housing
Incentives, Community Engagement, Data-Driven Planning & Technology,
Sustainable & Equitable Growth, and Robust Implementation---aims to
create vibrant, sustainable, and equitable neighborhoods. Enacting these
policies will unlock housing potential, build connected communities,
ensure equitable opportunity, and create thriving, affordable
communities for all.

**Preamble: Housing Crisis & Sustainable Growth\
**Skyrocketing housing costs and unchecked urban sprawl are
unsustainable. Smart Densification---strategic, thoughtful housing
growth within existing urban areas---is crucial for safe, affordable
housing and thriving, connected communities. This platform focuses on
building better, equitable, and sustainable neighborhoods through
densification.

**Vision: Thriving, Connected, Affordable Neighborhoods**

-   **Affordable & Diverse Housing:** Range of housing options
    (apartments, townhouses, ADUs, smaller homes) ensures affordability
    for all income levels. Housing is a fundamental need and community
    cornerstone. Goal: 30% affordable units in new developments.

-   **Walkable & Vibrant Communities:** Flourishing local businesses,
    accessible parks/green spaces, daily needs within walking/cycling
    distance, reducing car dependence and fostering community.

-   **Efficient & Future-Ready Infrastructure:** Optimized existing
    infrastructure and strategic investments in transit, utilities, and
    amenities to support density and enhance quality of life.

-   **Environmentally Responsible & Sustainable Development:**
    Densification minimizes sprawl, protects nature, promotes
    eco-friendly transport, reduces carbon footprint, and incorporates
    green building standards. Dense urban cores emit 50% less COâ‚‚ per
    capita than suburbs (C40 Cities).

-   **Inclusive, Welcoming, & Equitable Neighborhoods:** New development
    integrates with existing communities, respects local character,
    fosters social connections, prevents displacement, and ensures
    equitable housing access across socioeconomic spectrums. Community
    engagement shapes development reflecting local values.

**Roles & Responsibilities\
**Collaborative effort: Federal, state/provincial, local governments,
developers, non-profits, community groups.

-   **Federal:** Policy direction, major funding, agency coordination.

-   **State/Provincial:** Regional adaptation, state funding/incentives,
    alignment with local authorities.

-   **Local:** Zoning reforms, community engagement, permitting,
    neighborhood-specific projects.

-   **Housing & Livability Commission:** Oversight, progress auditing,
    equity enforcement.

Success measured by short-, medium-, and long-term targets for
affordable units, infrastructure, and environmental performance.

**Policy Pillars for Smart Densification**

**1. Zoning Modernization: Unlock Housing Potential\
**Reform outdated zoning barriers to densification and affordability.

-   **End Exclusionary Zoning:** Eliminate single-family zoning;
    legalize diverse housing (multi-family, townhouses, ADUs) in more
    residential areas, especially near transit/jobs. Aligns with UC
    Berkeley research on exclusionary zoning and displacement.

    -   **Action:** End single-family zoning, legalize diverse housing.

    -   **Timeline:** Short-term: model ordinances; Medium-term: grants
        conditioned on reform; Long-term: density goals for
        municipalities.

    -   **Example:** Minneapolis, Portland zoning reform boosted housing
        supply (Minneapolis +12%).

-   

-   **Right-Size Lot Sizes & Parking:** Lower minimum lot sizes;
    reduce/eliminate parking mandates, especially near transit.

-   **Streamline Permitting:** Expedite approvals for
    infill/densification projects aligning with community/sustainability
    plans. Fast-track affordable housing projects.

    -   **Action:** Simplify/expedite approvals for compliant projects.
