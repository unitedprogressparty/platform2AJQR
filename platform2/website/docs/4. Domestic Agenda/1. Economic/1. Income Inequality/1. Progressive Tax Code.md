# **Progressive Wealth and Income Tax Plan**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines the **Progressive Wealth and Income Tax Plan**, a
comprehensive tax framework designed to promote economic equity, enhance
revenue generation, and ensure fiscal sustainability. Our model
integrates key elements from **McKenny\'s Wealth Tax Proposal** and
**Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s (FDR) highly progressive income tax
structure**, creating a robust system that targets both income and
wealth disparities. This plan aims to establish a fair taxation system
that adapts to contemporary economic challenges while fostering social
and economic well-being.

## **1. Income Tax Structure**

### **A. Progressive Tax Brackets**

The income tax system is structured with multiple progressive brackets,
ensuring that higher income levels are subject to higher tax rates. The
following table outlines the proposed tax brackets:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Income Range (USD)**                     **Tax Rate (%)**
  ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------
  Up to 50,000                               10%

  50,001 - 100,000                           20%

  100,001 - 250,000                          30%

  250,001 - 500,000                          40%

  500,001 - 1,000,000                        55%

  **Above 1,000,000**                        **70%**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note: These figures are illustrative and subject to periodic
adjustments based on economic indicators and policy reviews.*

### **B. Tax Base and Deductions**

To maintain progressivity and ensure maximum revenue from high-income
earners, the following measures are adopted:

-   **Limited Deductions:** High-income individuals face stricter
    limitations on deductions and exemptions to prevent erosion of the
    tax base.

-   **Standard Deductions:** Lower-income brackets benefit from more
    generous standard deductions to reduce taxable income and alleviate
    tax burdens.

-   **Itemized Deductions:** Available primarily for middle and
    lower-income earners, encouraging transparency and fairness.

## **2. Wealth Tax Structure**

### **A. Progressive Wealth Tax Brackets**

Building on McKenny\'s Wealth Tax Proposal, the wealth tax is designed
to target net wealth accumulation with progressive rates. The structure
is as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Net Wealth (USD)**                         **Tax Rate (%)**
  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------
  Up to 1,000,000                              0%

  1,000,001 - 5,000,000                        0.5%

  5,000,001 - 20,000,000                       1.0%

  20,000,001 - 100,000,000                     1.5%

  **Above 100,000,000**                        **2.0%**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### **B. Tax Base and Valuation**

-   **Comprehensive Asset Inclusion:** The wealth tax applies to a wide
    array of assets, including financial instruments, real estate,
    business equity, luxury goods, and intellectual property.

-   **Valuation Methods:**

    -   **Market Valuation:** Assets are valued based on current market
        prices.

    -   **Professional Appraisals:** Non-liquid or unique assets undergo
        professional appraisals to determine fair market value.

    -   **Self-Reporting:** Taxpayers are required to declare asset
        values, subject to verification and audits.

### **C. Exemptions and Deductions**

To ensure fairness and practicality, certain exemptions and deductions
are incorporated:

-   **Primary Residence Exemption:** Up to \$2,000,000 of the primary
    residence's value is exempt from the wealth tax.

-   **Debt Deductions:** Net wealth is calculated after accounting for
    liabilities, including mortgage debt and other significant debts.

-   **Business Exemptions:** Small businesses with valuations below
    \$5,000,000 receive partial exemptions to encourage
    entrepreneurship.

## **3. Capital Gains and Dividends Taxation**

## **11. The Role of Progressive Taxation in Addressing Capitalism\'s Excesses and Reducing Inequality**

Progressive taxation serves as a pivotal mechanism in mitigating the
inherent disparities that can arise within capitalist economic systems.
By systematically structuring tax rates to increase with higher income
and wealth brackets, progressive tax plans aim to balance the
distribution of economic resources, ensuring that those with greater
financial capacity contribute proportionately more to the public
treasury. This approach not only fosters a more equitable society but
also curtails the potential for excessive accumulation of wealth by
individuals or entities, which can otherwise lead to disproportionate
influence over economic and political spheres.

### **A. Mitigating Income and Wealth Inequality**

One of the core objectives of progressive taxation is to address the
widening gap between the affluent and the less privileged. In capitalist
economies, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few can lead to
significant imbalances in economic power and social mobility. By
imposing higher tax rates on top earners and substantial wealth holders,
progressive tax systems redistribute resources more evenly across the
population. This redistribution supports public services, education,
healthcare, and social safety nets, which are essential for leveling the
playing field and providing opportunities for upward mobility to those
from lower-income backgrounds.

### **B. Preventing the Accumulation of Economic Power**

Excessive accumulation of wealth can translate into concentrated
economic power, enabling affluent individuals and corporations to exert
undue influence over market dynamics, regulatory frameworks, and
political institutions. Progressive taxation acts as a counterbalance by
ensuring that wealth accumulation is moderated and that the benefits of
economic success are shared more broadly. This moderation helps prevent
monopolistic practices, fosters competitive markets, and safeguards
democratic processes from being overshadowed by the interests of a
wealthy elite.

### **C. Enhancing Democratic Governance**

A significant concern within capitalist systems is the potential for
wealth to translate into political power, undermining democratic
principles. When individuals or corporations amass substantial wealth,
they may leverage financial resources to influence policy decisions,
electoral outcomes, and legislative processes. Progressive tax policies,
by reducing extreme wealth concentrations, diminish the capacity of the
wealthy to disproportionately sway political agendas. This ensures that
governance remains more representative of the broader population\'s
interests, promoting policies that reflect the needs and aspirations of
the majority rather than a select few.

### **D. Promoting Social Cohesion and Stability**

Economic disparities can lead to social tensions and unrest, as
marginalized groups may feel disenfranchised and excluded from the
benefits of economic growth. Progressive taxation contributes to social
cohesion by fostering a sense of shared responsibility and mutual
support within society. By ensuring that wealthier individuals
contribute a fairer share, progressive tax systems help build trust in
public institutions and reduce the likelihood of social fragmentation.
This cohesion is vital for maintaining a stable and harmonious society,
where all members feel valued and supported.

### **E. Encouraging Responsible Wealth Utilization**

Progressive taxes incentivize the responsible utilization of wealth by
discouraging hoarding and promoting investment in productive activities.
High marginal tax rates on income and wealth can motivate individuals
and businesses to allocate resources towards innovation,
entrepreneurship, and philanthropy, rather than merely accumulating
assets. This redirection of wealth supports economic dynamism, fosters
innovation, and drives societal progress, ensuring that wealth serves as
a catalyst for positive change rather than an end in itself.

### **F. Supporting Sustainable Economic Growth**

By redistributing wealth and reducing inequality, progressive taxation
contributes to a more sustainable and resilient economic model.
Equitable distribution of resources ensures that a larger segment of the
population has the means to participate actively in the economy, driving
demand for goods and services. This broad-based economic participation
fosters stable and sustained growth, as it is less susceptible to the
volatility that can arise from unequal wealth distribution. Moreover,
investments in public goods and services, funded through progressive
taxes, lay the foundation for long-term economic stability and
prosperity.

### **G. Upholding Moral and Ethical Standards in Society**

Progressive taxation embodies the principles of fairness, justice, and
collective responsibility, making it not only an economic tool but also
a moral imperative. In a civilized society, it is deemed just for
individuals who have reaped significant financial rewards through their
endeavors to contribute proportionately to the common good. By paying an
equal and fair share, high earners uphold their responsibility to
support the societal infrastructure that enables their success. This
moral stance ensures that wealth accumulation does not come at the
expense of societal well-being but rather complements the collective
advancement of civilization.

Moreover, progressive taxes are a righteous means of preventing the
extreme concentrations of wealth that can undermine the very fabric of
capitalism and meritocracy. High earners retain the ability to be
affluent and continue to reward hard work and innovation, but without
amassing wealth to incomprehensible levels that distort economic and
social systems. This balance ensures that capitalism remains a dynamic
and merit-based system, where success is rewarded, but not to the extent
that it eclipses the equitable distribution of resources and
opportunities. During times of need, such as economic downturns or
social crises, progressive taxation provides the necessary fiscal tools
to address challenges without dismantling the incentives that drive
individual and collective progress.

In essence, progressive taxation is a manifestation of a society\'s
commitment to ethical standards and equitable principles. It ensures
that prosperity is shared, that the excesses of capitalism are kept in
check, and that the foundations of a fair and just civilization are
maintained. By implementing a progressive tax plan, we reinforce the
moral obligations that bind individuals to the greater good, fostering a
society where success is celebrated, shared, and sustainable.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing a **Progressive Wealth and Income Tax Plan** is a strategic
approach to addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by
capitalism\'s excesses and pervasive inequality. By ensuring that
taxation scales with income and wealth, the plan not only promotes a
more equitable distribution of resources but also safeguards democratic
governance, enhances social cohesion, upholds moral and ethical
standards, and supports sustainable economic growth. Through careful
design and robust administration, progressive taxation can serve as a
cornerstone for building a fairer, more inclusive society where economic
prosperity benefits all members, not just a privileged few.
