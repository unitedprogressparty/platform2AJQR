## Fulfilling Promises and Respecting Sovereignty

The relationship between the United States government and sovereign Native American tribal nations is founded upon treaties, federal laws, and a solemn trust responsibility. For centuries, however, this relationship has been marred by broken promises, systemic injustices, forced assimilation policies, and the failure to fully honor treaty obligations. Rectifying these historical and ongoing wrongs is a fundamental requirement of justice and a prerequisite for genuine reconciliation.

Our platform commits to a renewed era of nation-to-nation relationship building, grounded in respect for tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and the fulfillment of all treaty and trust responsibilities. We advocate for comprehensive federal action to empower tribal nations, address systemic inequities, and ensure the federal government upholds its legal and moral obligations.

### Key Pillars for Honoring Treaties and Trust Responsibilities:

1.  **Uphold Tribal Sovereignty and Self-Determination:**
    *   Respect the inherent sovereignty of tribal nations and their right to self-governance. Support tribal efforts to strengthen governance capacity, manage their own affairs, and determine their own futures.
    *   Ensure meaningful, robust, and regular consultation with tribal nations on all federal actions that significantly affect them, consistent with treaty rights and executive orders.

2.  **Fully Honor All Treaty Obligations:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive review of all existing treaties between the U.S. government and tribal nations to ensure full compliance with all provisions, including those related to land rights, water rights, hunting and fishing rights, resource management, and healthcare/education provisions.
    *   Establish clear mechanisms and provide adequate funding to fulfill unmet treaty obligations and address historical breaches of trust. Support processes for resolving land claims and restoring tribal homelands where appropriate.

3.  **Strengthen Public Safety and Justice in Indian Country:**
    *   Address the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples (MMIP) through increased federal resources for investigation, data collection, victim support services, and coordination between tribal, state, and federal law enforcement.
    *   Enhance tribal courts and law enforcement capacity. Support tribal jurisdiction over crimes committed on tribal lands, including crimes committed by non-Natives, consistent with the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorizations and further legislative action.
    *   Ensure robust enforcement of federal laws against crimes committed in Indian Country and improve coordination among jurisdictions.

4.  **Invest in Improving Quality of Life on Reservations ("Life On The Res"):**
    *   Dramatically increase federal funding for essential services in tribal communities, including healthcare (fully funding the Indian Health Service), education (Bureau of Indian Education schools and tribal colleges), housing, infrastructure (clean water, broadband, roads, energy), and economic development.
    *   Address systemic barriers to economic opportunity and support tribal initiatives for sustainable economic diversification.

5.  **Protect Natural and Cultural Resources:**
    *   Uphold tribal rights related to water, fishing, hunting, gathering, and sacred sites, as guaranteed by treaties and federal law. Ensure tribal consultation and consent on projects impacting these resources.
    *   Support tribal leadership in environmental stewardship, climate adaptation, and the restoration of traditional ecological knowledge. This includes supporting efforts like river restoration crucial to tribal cultures and subsistence. (See also section 3.5 Biodiversity).

6.  **Ensure Fair Access to Financial Services and Economic Opportunity:**
    *   Combat predatory lending and ensure fair access to banking and financial services for tribal members and communities.
    *   Support tribal economic development initiatives and ensure equitable access to federal economic programs and resources. Regulate financial services operating in or targeting Indian Country to prevent exploitation.

### Conclusion:

Honoring the treaties and trust responsibilities owed to Native American nations is a matter of fundamental justice and national integrity. It requires moving beyond rhetoric and implementing concrete policies that respect sovereignty, fulfill long-overdue obligations, address systemic inequities, and empower tribal nations to thrive. Our commitment is to forge a new relationship based on mutual respect, meaningful consultation, and the unwavering fulfillment of promises made.
