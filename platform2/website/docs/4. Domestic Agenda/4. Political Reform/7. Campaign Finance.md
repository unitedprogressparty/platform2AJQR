Below is a comprehensive federal campaign finance reform platform proposal designed to curb the outsized influence of big money in politics, empower small donors, and restore public confidence in our democracy. This proposal lays out a multi‑pronged strategy that modernizes the current system, enhances transparency, and reclaims the political process for the people.

## [Party Name] Federal Campaign Finance Reform Platform

### Preamble

Our democracy is founded on the principle that every citizen’s voice matters—and yet, today, the political process is increasingly dominated by vast sums of money from a few wealthy individuals and corporations. Court decisions such as Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC (2014) have paved the way for unlimited independent expenditures, giving super PACs and corporate donors unchecked influence over our elections. We believe it is time for bold federal action to level the playing field. Our platform proposes comprehensive reforms that prioritize small donor contributions, implement robust public financing mechanisms, and restore fairness to our electoral system.

---

### 1. Expand Public Financing and Matching Funds

- **Nationwide Small-Donor Matching Program:**  
  • Establish a federal program that matches every small-dollar contribution (up to a set threshold, for example, $200) at a fixed ratio (such as 6:1).  
  • Fund this program through a dedicated revenue stream—for instance, by assessing modest fees on corporate fines for financial malfeasance—so that taxpayer dollars are reinvested directly in our democratic process.  
  • Encourage candidates to rely on broad-based support from everyday voters rather than courting a few large donors.

- **Direct Public Campaign Financing:**  
  • Create a public campaign financing system that offers eligible candidates a base sum to cover essential campaign costs in exchange for agreeing to spending limits and strict disclosure rules.  
  • Develop alternative models—such as democracy vouchers or a direct cash allocation to candidates—ensuring that every political race is accessible without the disproportionate sway of big money.

---

### 2. Overturn Big Money and Corporate Influence

- **Constitutional Amendment to Restore Democratic Equality:**  
  • Advocate for a constitutional amendment that overturns Citizens United and related court decisions, reaffirming that money is not equivalent to speech and that corporate resources must not translate into disproportionate political power.  
  • Ensure the amendment explicitly restricts independent expenditures by corporations and unions while safeguarding the free expression of ideas through transparent and regulated channels.

- **Restrict Corporate and Super PAC Contributions:**  
  • Prohibit direct and indirect contributions from corporate political action committees to federal candidates.  
  • Impose strict limits on the size of individual donations to super PACs and require that all contributions above a modest threshold be fully disclosed—including the original sources behind shell organizations—to eliminate “dark money” from our elections.

---

### 3. Enhance Transparency and Disclosure

- **Comprehensive Donor Disclosure:**  
  • Mandate that all organizations involved in election-related spending, including super PACs and independent expenditure groups, must disclose the identities of their major donors within a short timeframe.  
  • Utilize modern digital platforms to create a centralized, publicly accessible database that enables voters to trace the flow of money from donors to political spending.

- **Digital and Media Oversight:**  
  • Update current campaign finance rules to cover online political advertising and digital media, requiring platforms to maintain “political files” that log expenditures and sources for all election-related ads.  
  • Strengthen penalties for deliberate non-disclosure or deceptive reporting practices.

---

### 4. Reform the Federal Election Commission (FEC)

- **Restructure for Effective Oversight:**  
  • Revamp the FEC by reducing the number of commissioners to create a more agile, non-partisan body, and appoint at least one independent commissioner to break partisan deadlock.  
  • Provide the FEC with enhanced enforcement powers—including the ability to conduct random audits and impose meaningful penalties—to ensure compliance with new campaign finance laws.
  
- **Improve Resources and Accountability:**  
  • Allocate increased funding and staffing to the FEC so that it can effectively monitor campaign expenditures and enforce transparency standards.  
  • Establish clear benchmarks and performance metrics for the FEC to assess its progress in combating corruption and undue influence in elections.

---

### 5. Counteract the Effects of Court Decisions

- **Addressing Citizens United and McCutcheon:**  
  • Recognize that landmark decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon have allowed the political influence of the wealthy to flourish.  
  • Commit to legislative measures—and ultimately a constitutional amendment—that recalibrate the balance between free speech and fair elections, ensuring that political power remains in the hands of the many, not the few.

- **Closing Loopholes:**  
  • Revisit and tighten the rules around “independent expenditures” to prevent covert coordination between super PACs and candidate campaigns.  
  • Eliminate loopholes that enable large donations to be split into smaller contributions to bypass existing limits.

---

### Conclusion

This comprehensive reform package is not just about curbing the influence of big money—it is about restoring the democratic ideal that our government must serve all its citizens, not just the wealthiest few. By expanding public financing, implementing robust matching programs, enhancing transparency, reforming the FEC, and overturning detrimental court precedents, we can create an electoral system that is fair, accountable, and truly reflective of the people’s will.

We call on all lawmakers, citizens, and advocacy groups to support these reforms and work together to build a democracy where every vote—and every dollar—counts equally.

This proposal represents our commitment to reclaiming the democratic process from the grip of big money, ensuring that our political system is responsive to the interests of the many, not the few.

Several pieces of legislation in the last decade have aimed to reform campaign finance by reducing the influence of large donors and increasing transparency, even if not all have become law. Here are some notable examples:

1. **The For the People Act (and its related Freedom to Vote Act versions)**  
   - Introduced multiple times since 2019, this sweeping reform package includes provisions for public campaign financing such as small-donor matching funds (for instance, a 6:1 match on contributions up to a set limit).  
   - Although the House has passed it on a near party-line vote, it has repeatedly stalled in the Senate due to filibuster challenges.  
   - This legislation represents one of the most prominent recent efforts to both expand voting access and curb the influence of big money by incentivizing broad-based, small-dollar donations.

2. **The Government by the People Act (H.R. 20)**  
   - Proposed in the 113th Congress (around 2014), this bill sought to implement a public financing system that would match small contributions and limit reliance on large private donations.  
   - Although it generated significant discussion and some bipartisan support, it ultimately did not advance into law.

3. **The Empowering Citizens Act**  
   - Introduced by Representatives David Price and Chris Van Hollen in 2013, this proposal aimed to create a small-donor public financing system modeled on programs in places like New York City.  
   - Its design included matching funds for contributions and stricter limits on individual donations to promote grassroots fundraising.  
   - Despite its innovative approach, the bill did not pass Congress.

4. **State and Local Clean Elections Initiatives**  
   - In several states (such as Maine, Arizona, and even local programs in cities like Seattle), voters have approved measures that offer public funds or matching systems for campaigns.  
   - Some of these initiatives have faced legal challenges or been repealed (for example, certain Clean Elections measures in California and Portland were overturned or repealed), illustrating both the promise and the difficulty of reform at the subnational level.

5. **Constitutional Amendments Proposed to Overturn Citizens United**  
   - Various groups (e.g., Move to Amend) have pushed for a constitutional amendment—often referred to as the "We the People Amendment"—to reverse Citizens United and reestablish limits on corporate spending in politics.  
   - Although such amendments have been introduced repeatedly in Congress, none have been enacted, as they face the very high threshold required for constitutional change.

These legislative efforts, both at the federal and state levels, reflect a broad concern that the current system disproportionately amplifies the voices of a few wealthy donors while muting ordinary citizens. Even when bills addressing these issues fail to pass, they help shape the public debate and build momentum for future reforms.
