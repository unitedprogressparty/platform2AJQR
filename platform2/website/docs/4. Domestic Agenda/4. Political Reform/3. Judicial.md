# Comprehensive Proposal to Reform the Supreme Court

## I. Introduction

In recent years, there is growing concern that the United States Supreme Court has been increasingly dominated by a conservative majority—one that risks entrenching policies and judicial interpretations that may undermine democratic norms for decades to come. We believe that without reform, this imbalance will shape American jurisprudence in ways that could wreck democracy for the next 60 years. This proposal outlines a suite of reforms designed to restore the Court’s legitimacy, promote accountability, and ensure that the highest judicial body in the nation reflects the evolving democratic values of our society. The proposed reforms include dramatically expanding the number of justices, instituting rotation and term limits, and establishing an independent ethics board with robust enforcement powers.

## II. Rationale and Background

The Supreme Court’s conservative tilt has led to controversial decisions on key issues—ranging from voting rights and campaign finance to civil rights and executive accountability. Critics argue that this ideological imbalance limits the Court’s capacity to check government overreach and to safeguard minority rights and democratic principles. Many legal scholars and political commentators have proposed that fundamental changes are necessary to realign the Court with the broader values of the American people.

Historical attempts to reform the Court have included proposals for expansion and term limits. Over the years, several legislative initiatives and proposed constitutional amendments have aimed to diversify and depoliticize the Court, though many have stalled in Congress or failed to gain traction at the state level. For example, recent proposals by Senate Democrats have advocated for an 18-year term limit for justices and the expansion of the Court to 15 or more seats. Despite these efforts, no comprehensive reform has been enacted, and conservative dominance continues.

## III. Proposed Reforms

### A. Court Expansion

1. **Dramatic Increase in the Number of Justices:**  
   We propose expanding the Supreme Court from its current nine members to a larger panel—potentially 15 to 17 justices—to ensure a broader representation of legal, academic, and regional perspectives. A larger Court would help dilute any single ideological majority and foster a more balanced approach to constitutional interpretation.

2. **Balanced Nomination Process:**  
   Establish safeguards in the nomination process to ensure that new appointees represent diverse professional backgrounds, ideologies, and experiences, reducing the risk of extreme partisanship.

### B. Term Limits and Rotation

1. **Implementing Term Limits:**  
   Introduce a constitutional amendment or federal legislation to impose fixed term limits on Supreme Court justices—for example, 18-year terms. This approach would replace the current system of life tenure, reducing the likelihood of long-term entrenchment of any single ideological perspective.

2. **Establishing a Rotation System:**  
   Consider a rotation mechanism where a subset of justices is periodically replaced or rotated between the Supreme Court and lower federal courts. This model could ensure continuous renewal and maintain judicial vitality while preserving institutional memory.

3. **Mandatory Retirement or Age Limits:**  
   Explore the feasibility of introducing a mandatory retirement age (e.g., 70 or 75 years) to prevent the prolonged tenure of justices whose views may become increasingly out of step with contemporary societal values.

### C. Enhanced Judicial Ethics and Accountability

1. **Creation of an Independent Ethics Board:**  
   Establish an independent, federally mandated ethics board with the authority to investigate and discipline Supreme Court justices for ethical violations. This board should have subpoena power, the ability to impose meaningful sanctions, and transparent procedures to ensure accountability.

2. **Binding Code of Ethics:**  
   Develop a binding code of conduct for Supreme Court justices that includes:
   - Mandatory disclosure of financial interests and gifts.
   - Restrictions on political activity and public commentary on pending cases.
   - Requirements to recuse themselves in cases of potential conflicts of interest.
   - Regular audits and reviews to enforce compliance.

3. **Public Reporting and Transparency:**  
   Mandate that the ethics board publish regular reports on its activities, findings, and any disciplinary actions taken. This transparency will help build public trust and ensure that judicial conduct remains above reproach.

### D. Legislative and Constitutional Initiatives

1. **Federal Legislative Action:**  
   Congress should introduce and pass legislation that sets forth the framework for these reforms, including provisions for court expansion, term limits, and the establishment of an independent ethics board. Previous proposals—including those introduced by Senate Democrats—provide a useful foundation, even if they have not yet advanced.

2. **Constitutional Amendment Efforts:**  
   Given that life tenure and the structure of the Supreme Court are enshrined in the Constitution, a constitutional amendment may be necessary to institute term limits and significant changes to the Court’s composition. This process, though challenging, is essential to ensuring the Court evolves with contemporary democratic values.

3. **Review of Past Proposals:**  
   We will study and build upon earlier proposals that have been introduced in Congress but failed—such as past attempts to impose term limits or expand the Court—and refine these proposals to address concerns raised by opponents, thus creating a more resilient and politically viable reform package.

## IV. Implementation Strategy

Our strategy combines state-level advocacy, federal legislative initiatives, and constitutional amendment efforts to achieve comprehensive reform of the Supreme Court.

### A. State-Level Advocacy and Public Engagement

- **Educational Campaigns:**  
  Launch nationwide educational campaigns to inform the public about the need for judicial reform, emphasizing how current life tenure and ideological imbalances can affect democracy for decades.  
- **Grassroots Mobilization:**  
  Partner with civic organizations, legal associations, and advocacy groups to build grassroots support for expanding and reforming the Court.
- **State Legislature Outreach:**  
  Engage with state legislators to build support for resolutions calling on Congress to act on Supreme Court reforms and for states to pass laws aligning with these reforms.

### B. Federal Legislative and Constitutional Path

- **Drafting Legislation:**  
  Work with bipartisan coalitions in Congress to draft comprehensive legislation that includes court expansion, term limits, and the creation of an independent ethics board. This legislation should be designed to withstand constitutional scrutiny and address previous criticisms.
- **Building Bipartisan Consensus:**  
  Engage with legislators across party lines by emphasizing that these reforms are not about partisan advantage but about enhancing the legitimacy and accountability of the judiciary. Public hearings, expert panels, and stakeholder consultations will be crucial.
- **Constitutional Amendment Process:**  
  Initiate a process to propose a constitutional amendment that enshrines term limits and other key reforms. This will involve a coordinated effort to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states.

### C. Oversight and Legal Preparedness

- **Establishing an Independent Oversight Committee:**  
  Create a joint oversight committee comprising legal scholars, former judges, and bipartisan legislators to monitor progress, evaluate reform proposals, and coordinate between state and federal initiatives.
- **Legal Defense Strategy:**  
  Prepare for potential legal challenges by assembling a panel of constitutional law experts who can defend the reforms in court. This panel will help ensure that the proposed changes are consistent with constitutional provisions and past judicial precedent.
- **Review of Legislative History:**  
  Analyze previous legislative attempts to reform the Court, documenting what has failed and why. Use these insights to craft proposals that address past shortcomings and offer clear, achievable pathways for reform.

## V. Conclusion

Our proposal to reform the Supreme Court is a comprehensive, multi-faceted strategy aimed at restoring balance, accountability, and public confidence in one of the nation’s most vital institutions. By dramatically expanding the Court’s size, instituting term limits and a rotation system, and establishing an independent ethics board with real enforcement powers, we can prevent the entrenchment of an ideological majority that threatens democracy for decades. Coupled with robust legislative and constitutional efforts, and supported by a growing state-level movement, these reforms will ensure that the Supreme Court reflects and upholds the democratic principles upon which our nation was founded. It is time to take decisive action to fix the Court and secure the future of American democracy.
