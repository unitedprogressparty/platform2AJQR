## Investing in Student Well-being and Academic Success

Schools are critical environments for supporting the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. Students spend a significant portion of their days in school, making it an ideal setting for early identification of mental health challenges, provision of accessible support services, and promotion of positive social-emotional development. However, schools across the nation are chronically under-resourced in mental health personnel and programs, leaving many students without the support they need to thrive academically and emotionally.

Our platform calls for a major federal investment to **expand comprehensive, integrated mental health services in every K-12 school**. Providing accessible mental healthcare in schools is essential for addressing the youth mental health crisis, improving educational outcomes, promoting equity, and creating safer, more supportive learning environments.

### Key Strategies for Expanding School-Based Mental Health:

1.  **Increase Funding for School Mental Health Professionals:**
    *   Provide significant federal grants to hire and retain substantially more school counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other qualified mental health professionals in schools. Aim to meet or exceed professionally recommended student-to-provider ratios.
    *   Offer loan forgiveness programs and scholarships to incentivize individuals to enter school-based mental health professions, particularly in underserved districts.

2.  **Implement Universal Mental Health Screening and Early Intervention:**
    *   Support voluntary, evidence-based mental health screening programs in schools to identify students who may need support early on, before challenges escalate. Ensure screenings are conducted ethically, with parental consent and appropriate follow-up.
    *   Fund early intervention programs and tiered systems of support (MTSS) within schools to provide targeted assistance to students with identified needs.

3.  **Integrate Mental Health into the School Environment:**
    *   Promote the integration of mental health services with academic support and school health services. Encourage collaboration between educators, mental health staff, and families.
    *   Support the implementation of school-wide social-emotional learning (SEL) curricula to help all students develop self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.

4.  **Expand Access to School-Based Therapy and Support:**
    *   Ensure schools can provide or directly link students to a range of mental health services, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, and referrals to community-based providers for more intensive care when needed.
    *   Support the expansion of school-based health centers that offer integrated physical and mental healthcare.
    *   Leverage telehealth to expand access to specialized mental health services, especially in rural or underserved areas.

5.  **Create Positive and Supportive School Climates:**
    *   Invest in programs that foster safe, inclusive, and supportive school environments, including anti-bullying initiatives, restorative justice practices (as an alternative to punitive discipline), and trauma-informed school approaches.

### Conclusion:

Investing in school-based mental health services is an investment in our children's future and the well-being of our communities. By ensuring that every school has adequate mental health professionals, implementing early identification and intervention programs, and fostering supportive learning environments, we can address the youth mental health crisis, improve academic success, promote equity, and help students build the foundation for healthy and productive lives. This is a critical component of both our education and healthcare agendas.
