## Aligning Federal Agencies with a Modern Approach to Substance Use and Mental Health

The missions and practices of key federal agencies, particularly the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), must evolve to reflect a modern, public health-oriented understanding of substance use and mental health. For decades, the DEA's primary focus on prohibition and enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act has contributed to the failures of the War on Drugs, while the FDA's regulatory processes, though essential for safety, can sometimes impede access to potentially beneficial therapies, including those for mental health and substance use disorders (SUD).

Our platform calls for a significant **refocusing of the DEA and FDA** to better support public health goals, harm reduction, therapeutic innovation, and equitable access to treatment, while maintaining appropriate controls against diversion and ensuring product safety.

### Refocusing the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA):

1.  **Shift Primary Focus from Prohibition to Harm Reduction and Trafficking:**
    *   Reorient the DEA's core mission away from pursuing low-level drug possession offenses (consistent with decriminalization, see section 6.4.5) towards dismantling large-scale, violent drug trafficking organizations, both domestic and international.
    *   Explicitly direct the DEA to support, rather than obstruct, public health initiatives like harm reduction programs (e.g., syringe services, overdose prevention sites where legally sanctioned) by ensuring their operations are not unduly targeted by enforcement actions.

2.  **Facilitate Access to Controlled Substances for Legitimate Medical and Research Purposes:**
    *   Streamline and reform DEA regulations and registration processes that create unnecessary barriers for healthcare providers prescribing Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for SUD (e.g., removing the X-waiver for buprenorphine, easing methadone restrictions).
    *   Reform regulations that impede legitimate scientific research on Schedule I substances (like psychedelics and cannabis) with potential therapeutic value for mental health conditions, allowing researchers easier access for clinical trials under appropriate oversight.

3.  **Increase Transparency and Accountability:**
    *   Enhance oversight and public reporting on DEA enforcement activities to ensure they align with public health priorities and do not disproportionately impact marginalized communities.

### Reforming the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):

1.  **Expedite Review for Mental Health and SUD Therapies:**
    *   Create dedicated pathways and allocate resources within the FDA to expedite the review and approval of novel therapies for mental health conditions and SUD, particularly those addressing unmet needs or utilizing innovative mechanisms (e.g., psychedelic-assisted therapy, new MAT options).

2.  **Modernize Clinical Trial Requirements:**
    *   Adapt clinical trial requirements for certain MH/SUD therapies (like psychedelic-assisted therapy) to better reflect their unique characteristics, while maintaining rigorous standards for safety and efficacy. Explore the use of real-world evidence and adaptive trial designs.

3.  **Ensure Equitable Access Post-Approval:**
    *   Work proactively during the approval process to consider factors that will impact equitable access to new therapies post-approval, including cost, insurance coverage, and distribution challenges.

4.  **Balance Safety with Access for Harm Reduction Tools:**
    *   Ensure FDA regulations facilitate, rather than hinder, access to proven harm reduction tools like naloxone and fentanyl test strips, including supporting over-the-counter availability where appropriate.

### Conclusion:

Aligning the missions and practices of the DEA and FDA with a public health framework is crucial for effectively addressing the nation's mental health and substance use crises. By shifting the DEA's focus from low-level enforcement to high-level trafficking and harm reduction support, and by enabling the FDA to facilitate safe and timely access to innovative therapies and harm reduction tools, we can create a more rational, humane, and effective federal approach. This refocusing supports our broader goals of decriminalization, treatment expansion, and therapeutic innovation.
