## Treating Substance Use Disorder as a Health Issue, Not a Crime

The decades-long "War on Drugs" has failed. Criminalizing substance use has led to mass incarceration, disproportionately harmed communities of color, fueled stigma, and failed to address the underlying public health crisis of addiction. Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a complex health condition, often co-occurring with mental illness and influenced by social determinants like poverty and trauma. It requires a compassionate, evidence-based public health approach focused on prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support, not punishment.

Our platform calls for a paradigm shift: ending the criminalization of drug use and investing heavily in a comprehensive continuum of care for addiction treatment and harm reduction services.

### Key Strategies for Addressing Addiction:

1.  **Decriminalize Personal Drug Use and Possession:**
    *   End arrests and criminal penalties for the personal possession and use of illicit drugs. Redirect law enforcement resources away from pursuing low-level drug offenses towards addressing serious and violent crime.
    *   Focus legal efforts on dismantling large-scale drug trafficking organizations, not on punishing individuals struggling with addiction. (Note: This requires coordination with foreign policy regarding international drug trafficking, see Section 5).

2.  **Expand Access to Evidence-Based Addiction Treatment:**
    *   Massively increase federal funding for a full spectrum of voluntary, evidence-based SUD treatment options, including:
        *   Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) available on demand without barriers.
        *   Outpatient and inpatient counseling and therapy.
        *   Residential treatment programs.
        *   Detoxification services.
    *   Ensure treatment is affordable and accessible through universal healthcare coverage with mental health parity (see section 6.4.1).
    *   Integrate SUD treatment with primary care and mental health services.

3.  **Invest in Harm Reduction Services:**
    *   Support and fund evidence-based harm reduction strategies proven to save lives and reduce the negative consequences of drug use. This includes:
        *   Syringe services programs (SSPs) to prevent the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C.
        *   Naloxone (Narcan) distribution and training to reverse opioid overdoses.
        *   Drug checking services (e.g., fentanyl test strips) to prevent accidental overdoses.
        *   Overdose prevention sites (also known as supervised consumption sites) where individuals can use pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision, preventing fatal overdoses and connecting people to care.

4.  **Promote Recovery Support Services:**
    *   Fund peer support programs, recovery housing, employment assistance, and other services that help individuals maintain long-term recovery and reintegrate into their communities.
    *   Combat stigma associated with addiction through public education campaigns.

5.  **Focus on Prevention:**
    *   Invest in evidence-based prevention programs in schools and communities that address risk factors for substance use and promote healthy coping mechanisms.
    *   Address the root causes of addiction, including trauma, poverty, lack of opportunity, and mental illness.

### Conclusion:

Treating addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal justice problem, is more humane, effective, and just. By decriminalizing personal drug use, investing in accessible treatment and harm reduction services, and promoting recovery, we can save lives, reduce crime, heal communities, and end the devastating legacy of the failed War on Drugs. This approach aligns with our commitment to healthcare as a right and evidence-based policymaking.
