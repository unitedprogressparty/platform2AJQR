## Ensuring Oral Health as a Fundamental Component of Overall Health

Oral health is inextricably linked to overall physical and mental well-being. Poor dental health is associated with serious conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Yet, dental care remains inaccessible and unaffordable for millions of Americans, often excluded from traditional health insurance plans or requiring significant out-of-pocket costs. This creates profound health inequities, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals, communities of color, seniors, and people with disabilities.

Our platform advocates for the full integration of comprehensive dental care into our universal healthcare system, ensuring that essential oral health services are **free at the point of service for all residents**. Treating dental care as an essential component of healthcare, rather than an optional luxury, is crucial for achieving true health equity and improving population health outcomes.

### Key Components of Universal, Free Dental Care:

1.  **Comprehensive Coverage:**
    *   Guarantee coverage for a full range of dental services, including preventive care (cleanings, exams, x-rays, fluoride treatments, sealants), restorative care (fillings, crowns, root canals), periodontics (gum disease treatment), oral surgery (extractions), and dentures. Orthodontics may be covered based on medical necessity.
    *   Eliminate deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for all covered essential dental services.

2.  **Integration with Overall Healthcare:**
    *   Incorporate dental benefits directly into the national health plan (whether a public option or a single-payer system as outlined in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2). Ensure seamless coordination between medical and dental providers.
    *   Promote integrated care models where dental services are co-located or closely coordinated with primary medical care, particularly in community health centers.

3.  **Expanding the Dental Workforce and Access:**
    *   Invest in expanding the dental workforce, particularly in underserved rural and urban areas. This includes increasing funding for dental schools, supporting loan repayment programs for dentists practicing in underserved communities, and exploring the expanded use of dental therapists and hygienists for routine care under appropriate supervision.
    *   Support mobile dental clinics and teledentistry to reach geographically isolated populations and individuals with mobility limitations.

4.  **Focus on Prevention and Oral Health Education:**
    *   Invest in public health campaigns promoting oral hygiene, healthy diets, and the importance of regular dental checkups.
    *   Support school-based dental programs, including screenings, sealant application, and fluoride varnish programs, particularly in low-income communities.
    *   Promote community water fluoridation as a safe and effective public health measure.

5.  **Funding Mechanism:**
    *   Finance universal dental care through the same progressive taxation mechanisms used to fund the broader national healthcare system, ensuring sustainability and equitable contribution.

### Conclusion:

Oral health is not separate from overall health; it is a critical component of well-being. By guaranteeing universal access to comprehensive, free dental care, we can eliminate significant health disparities, reduce the burden of preventable oral diseases, improve overall health outcomes, and affirm the principle that healthcare, in all its essential forms, is a human right. Integrating dental care into our national health system is a necessary step towards achieving true health equity for all Americans.
