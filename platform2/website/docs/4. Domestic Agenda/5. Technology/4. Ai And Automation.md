## Shaping AI and Automation for Shared Prosperity and Human Well-being

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation technologies are rapidly transforming our economy, society, and daily lives. They offer immense potential for progressâ€”from accelerating scientific discovery and improving healthcare diagnostics to increasing productivity and creating new forms of entertainment. However, these powerful technologies also present significant risks, including job displacement, algorithmic bias and discrimination, erosion of privacy, potential for autonomous weapons, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few large tech companies.

Our platform advocates for a proactive and human-centered approach to governing AI and automation. We must harness the opportunities these technologies offer while mitigating the risks through thoughtful regulation, ethical guidelines, public investment, and policies that ensure a just transition for workers and communities. The goal is to shape the development and deployment of AI and automation in ways that align with democratic values, promote shared prosperity, and enhance human well-being.

### Key Strategies for Governing AI and Automation:

1.  **Establish Clear Ethical Frameworks and Regulatory Oversight:**
    *   Develop national ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment, emphasizing principles like fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, and human oversight.
    *   Create a dedicated federal agency or empower existing regulators (like the FTC, EEOC, NIST) to oversee high-risk AI applications (e.g., in employment, credit, healthcare, criminal justice, critical infrastructure). Regulations should be risk-based, focusing scrutiny on applications with the greatest potential for harm.
    *   Mandate transparency requirements, such as impact assessments, audits for bias, and explanations for significant AI-driven decisions affecting individuals.

2.  **Promote AI for Public Good:**
    *   Invest significantly in public R&D for AI applications that address major societal challenges, such as climate change modeling, disease research, disaster response, and accessibility for people with disabilities.
    *   Ensure public access to federally funded AI research, data sets (while protecting privacy), and tools to foster broader innovation and prevent private monopolies on foundational AI capabilities.

3.  **Address Workforce Impacts and Ensure a Just Transition:**
    *   Invest heavily in workforce development, retraining programs, and lifelong learning initiatives to help workers adapt to automation-driven changes in the labor market.
    *   Strengthen the social safety net (e.g., unemployment insurance, potentially exploring Universal Basic Income pilots) to support workers and communities disrupted by automation.
    *   Explore policies like portable benefits and worker data ownership to empower workers in the changing economy.
    *   Ensure workers have a voice in the deployment of automation technologies in the workplace through collective bargaining and co-determination models.

4.  **Combat Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination:**
    *   Mandate rigorous testing and auditing of AI systems used in sensitive domains (e.g., hiring, lending, policing) to identify and mitigate discriminatory biases based on race, gender, age, disability, or other protected characteristics.
    *   Ensure individuals have recourse and mechanisms for appeal when harmed by biased or inaccurate AI decisions.

5.  **Ensure Safety and Security:**
    *   Develop robust safety standards and testing protocols for AI systems, particularly those operating in the physical world (e.g., autonomous vehicles, robotics) or controlling critical infrastructure.
    *   Address the national security risks associated with AI, including the potential for autonomous weapons systems (advocating for international treaties to ban lethal autonomous weapons) and AI-enabled cyber threats.

6.  **Foster Public Dialogue and Engagement:**
    *   Promote broad public understanding and dialogue about the capabilities, limitations, and societal implications of AI and automation through education initiatives and public forums.
    *   Ensure diverse stakeholder participation (including civil society, labor unions, ethicists, and impacted communities) in AI governance processes.

### Conclusion:

AI and automation hold the potential for both unprecedented progress and significant disruption. A laissez-faire approach risks exacerbating inequality and creating unacceptable harms. By proactively establishing ethical guidelines, implementing smart regulations focused on high-risk applications, investing in public good AI, supporting workers through the transition, and fostering public engagement, we can steer the development of these powerful technologies towards a future that is more prosperous, equitable, and aligned with human values.
