## Prioritizing Scientific Discovery, Earth Observation, and Responsible Space Exploration

Space exploration inspires humanity and drives scientific and technological advancement. However, national space policy must be guided by clear priorities, fiscal responsibility, and a commitment to using space for peaceful purposes and the benefit of life on Earth. Our platform advocates for a pragmatic space policy that prioritizes scientific discovery through robotic missions and orbital stations, critically evaluates the cost and necessity of long-duration manned missions beyond Earth orbit, ensures NASA's independence, and assesses the role of military space activities.

### Key Elements of a Responsible Space Policy:

1.  **Focus on Earth Observation and Climate Science:**
    *   Strengthen NASA's Earth Science division and NOAA's satellite programs to enhance our ability to monitor climate change, track environmental degradation, predict natural disasters, and manage resources sustainably. Understanding and protecting our home planet must be a primary goal of our space activities.

2.  **Prioritize Robotic Exploration and Space-Based Science:**
    *   Invest robustly in robotic missions throughout the solar system (e.g., Mars rovers, outer planet probes, asteroid missions) and space-based observatories (like the James Webb Space Telescope successors). These missions provide immense scientific return at a fraction of the cost and risk of human missions.
    *   Support the continued operation and eventual transition from the International Space Station (ISS) to commercial low-Earth orbit (LEO) stations, fostering a commercial space economy while maintaining a platform for microgravity research and international collaboration.

3.  **Re-evaluate Long-Duration Manned Missions Beyond LEO:**
    *   **Critically Assess Manned Missions to the Moon and Mars:** While human exploration is inspiring, ambitious manned missions to the Moon (Artemis program) and Mars require enormous public expenditure with uncertain near-term scientific or societal returns compared to robotic alternatives or Earth-focused investments. We advocate for halting or significantly scaling back funding for these long-duration, deep-space manned missions until their costs, benefits, risks, and technological readiness are more clearly justified against other national priorities (like climate change, healthcare, or infrastructure). Focus should remain on LEO activities and robotic exploration in the interim.

4.  **Ensure NASA's Independence and Efficiency:**
    *   **End Congressional Micromanagement:** Protect NASA's budget and mission priorities from excessive congressional interference, earmarks, and politically motivated directives that often favor specific contractors or districts over scientific merit and cost-effectiveness. Empower NASA leadership to set long-term strategic goals based on scientific consensus and national needs.
    *   Promote efficiency and innovation within NASA and its partnerships with the commercial space sector.

5.  **Evaluate the Role and Cost of the Space Force:**
    *   Conduct a thorough, independent evaluation of the U.S. Space Force's mission, necessity, cost, and potential impact on the peaceful use of space. Ensure its activities are focused on genuine national security needs (like satellite protection and communication) and do not contribute to an unnecessary arms race or militarization of space. Assess potential redundancies with other military branches and civilian agencies.

6.  **Promote International Cooperation and Space Sustainability:**
    *   Champion international treaties and norms for the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space, including debris mitigation, traffic management, and resource utilization protocols. Foster collaboration on scientific missions and space situational awareness.

### Conclusion:

A responsible national space policy should prioritize tangible benefits for science and society on Earth. By focusing investment on Earth observation, cost-effective robotic exploration, and sustainable activities in low-Earth orbit, while critically evaluating expensive long-duration manned missions and ensuring military space activities are necessary and restrained, we can maintain leadership in space exploration in a way that is both inspiring and fiscally prudent.
