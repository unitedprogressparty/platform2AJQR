Great — I’ll create a strategic campaign-style postmortem of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with a clear executive summary followed by detailed sections. It will focus on national-level trends and spotlight key battleground states, while incorporating analysis of voter suppression laws, third-party candidates like RFK Jr., and the broader rise of the right, all through the lens of relevant political science and media theory literature.

I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.

# 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Postmortem: Strategic Analysis

## Executive Summary

The 2024 U.S. presidential election resulted in **Donald J. Trump defeating Kamala Harris** to become the 47th President, marking a stunning comeback for Trump and a bitter loss for Democrats. Trump won **312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)), flipping a series of battleground states that had gone Democratic in 2020. Nationally, the popular vote was extremely close – Trump earned ~49.8% to Harris’s ~48.3%, a **1.5-point margin** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)) (one of the narrowest in modern history). Voter turnout, while slightly down from the 2020 peak, remained high at around 64% of eligible voters ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). The election was characterized by dramatic events and trends, including an incumbent president’s late withdrawal, an assassination attempt on Trump, intense economic anxieties (inflation and housing costs), and deep polarization fueled by misinformation.

**Key findings from this strategic postmortem include:**

- **Electoral Shifts:** Trump **swept the critical swing states**, reclaiming the “Blue Wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (all narrowly) and winning Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada by varying margins. These flips (see table below) gave him a comfortable Electoral College win despite the close popular vote ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L316%20Electoral%20College%3A,as%20it%20did%20in%202020)). Every other state voted the same way as in 2020. Trump improved on his 2020 vote totals in most regions, securing an outright popular vote plurality (around 77.3 million votes) for the first time ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20Popular%20Vote)).

- **Voter Turnout and Demographics:** Turnout dipped from 2020’s historic level (66.6% to 63.9% in 2024) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)), with **notable declines among young and Black voters** – core Democratic constituencies that Harris struggled to mobilize ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Exit%20polls%20from%20the%20race,to%20the%20White%20House%20twice)). By contrast, seniors and rural voters (mostly pro-Trump groups) voted at high rates. Trump also **made inroads with minority voters**, especially **Latino and Black men**, cutting into traditional Democratic margins ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,and%20Harris%20inherited%20this%20disapproval)). Women comprised a slightly larger share of the electorate than in 2020, but Harris did **no better with women voters** than Biden had ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)), undercutting a key Democratic hope.

- **Issues and Messaging:** The campaign was dominated by **economic discontent**, with **inflation** and **housing costs** straining households. Voters’ judgment on these issues was “harshly negative” toward the incumbent party ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)). **Immigration and crime** were also salient, particularly boosting Trump in swing states. Republican messaging hammered the cost-of-living and border security failures, resonating with persuadable voters, while Democrats’ focus on abortion rights, healthcare, and defending democracy, though impactful to their base, **did not overcome the economic drag**. Polls showed **81% of voters rated the economy as “very important”** to their vote ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=As%20concerns%20around%20the%20state,in%20the%202024%20presidential%20election)) – an environment that favored Trump. Harris’s late-campaign populist proposals (e.g. price caps on essentials) weren’t enough to sway these perceptions.

- **Campaign Strategy and Organization:** The Democratic campaign faced extraordinary challenges after **President Biden withdrew in July 2024**, citing concerns about his debate performance and age ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Biden%20sought%20re,35)) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=were%20,41)). Harris had only **107 days** to mount a national campaign. She kept much of Biden’s team, leading to **internal disconnects** and a slow pivot to a Harris-centric message ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20campaign%20operation%20that%20stayed,Biden%27s)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). In contrast, the Trump campaign, though lacking incumbent advantages, was stable and relentlessly focused on battleground states. A major turning point was a **failed assassination attempt on Trump in July**, which he survived; this event generated huge sympathy and wall-to-wall media coverage, and Trump’s team leveraged it to reinforce his law-and-order theme. Harris never fully escaped association with Biden’s record, nor did she re-energize the Obama coalition. Republicans excelled in targeting turnout operations to rural and exurban areas while also engaging minority communities, contributing to Trump’s improved performance across the board.

- **Misinformation and Media:** The **information environment in 2024 was fraught with propaganda and conspiracy theories**. According to analysts, false claims about issues like the economy, crime, and election integrity **shaped voter perceptions and media narratives** ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). The attempted shooting of Trump spawned a wildfire of online misinformation within hours (with false flags and “deep state” conspiracies trending) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=As%20Americans%20tried%20to%20piece,the%20right%20or%20the%20left)) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=False%20claims%20that%20the%20assassination,were%20shared%20on%20social%20media)). The campaign took place amid what scholars call an *“asymmetric media ecosystem,”* where right-wing outlets and social media amplified pro-Trump or anti-Harris narratives far more aggressively than the mainstream press ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). This polluted information space often forced the campaigns (and election officials) into reactive mode. Despite efforts by platforms and fact-checkers, 2024 underscored how **erosion of a shared factual baseline** is impacting U.S. elections – a theme warned about in works like *Network Propaganda* and *The Chaos Machine*.

- **Election Integrity and Laws:** Post-2020 changes to voting laws had mixed effects. Several battleground states (e.g. GA, AZ, WI) implemented **stricter voting rules** – primarily limiting mail voting and drop boxes – which Democrats branded as voter suppression ([How Voting Laws Have Changed in Battleground States Since 2020 | Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-voting-laws-have-changed-battleground-states-2020#:~:text=In%20nine%20battleground%20states%20in,processes%20that%20make%20elections%20work)). Turnout in these states generally remained strong (Wisconsin even led the nation at ~77% turnout) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)), suggesting robust voter engagement overcame many barriers. However, it’s possible these laws **shaved off some Democratic-leaning turnout at the margins**, given the slight overall turnout drop and reports of voter confusion. No major controversies marred the casting or counting of votes; **election administration ran smoothly** and there were no credible fraud claims. In fact, Trump’s victory meant Republicans, for the first time in eight years, fully accepted the presidential result. Nonetheless, the election highlighted ongoing battles over how easy or hard it should be to vote, and both parties are sure to draw lessons on election rules and mobilization.

- **Third Parties and Spoilers:** Early fears that third-party candidates could tip the election (in particular, **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** pulling votes from Biden/Harris) largely did not materialize. Kennedy’s independent run collapsed when **he suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump** ([Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr._2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Democratic%20National%20Convention%20%20momentum.,90)), an unprecedented twist that actually **helped consolidate the anti-incumbent vote**. Other minor candidates, like Green Party nominee **Cornel West**, had minimal ballot presence. In the end, third-party and write-in votes totaled under 2% ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Democratic%20%C2%A0%20Kamala%20Harris%20Tim,2%2C878%2C359%201.85)), and **no state was decided solely by a spoiler effect**. The key battlegrounds were won by Trump with margins larger than the third-party vote, affirming that this election was essentially a two-way contest.

- **Long-Term Realignment:** 2024 confirmed and accelerated several long-term political realignments. Republicans continue to gain with **non-college-educated voters of all races**, and they solidified a **multiethnic working-class coalition**, while Democrats rely increasingly on **college-educated, urban and suburban voters**. Generationally, **younger voters lean strongly left but turned out in lower numbers**, whereas older voters skew right and vote reliably – a turnout gap that hurt Democrats ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). Notably, Trump’s GOP showed *growth* among some minority demographics (a nine-point lead among Hispanic men, for example) ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=match%20at%20L416%20to%20be,to%2045)), challenging Democrats to re-think outreach. Meanwhile, heavily Democratic areas like big-city suburbs saw slight Republican swings (e.g. Northern Virginia trended Republican compared to 2020) ([How Virginia Illustrates the 2024 Election - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/how-virginia-illustrates-the-2024-election/#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Kamala%20Harris%20carried%20Virginia,on%20her%20ticket)), perhaps due to economic issues cutting across the usual partisan lines. These shifts point to an evolving electorate where party coalitions are less about race alone and more about **age, education, and geography**.

- **Forecasting and Polling Accuracy:** Many high-profile forecasters were caught off guard by Trump’s clear win. Traditional prediction models (like Allan Lichtman’s “13 Keys”) **incorrectly called a Harris victory**, missing the impact of Biden’s late exit and voter discontent ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=Allan%20Lichtman%2C%20a%20historian%20and,said%C2%A0he%20stands%20by%20his%20call)). Poll-based forecasts indicated a toss-up – FiveThirtyEight gave Trump a ~52% chance ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=FiveThirtyEight%2C%20which%20uses%20polling%2C%20economic,simulations%20of%20the%202024%20race)) – and indeed the race was very close nationally. However, polling underestimated Trump in the Midwest once again. Analysts who focused on fundamentals (incumbent fatigue, inflation) ultimately fared better in hindsight than those who trusted narrow polling leads for Harris. The outcome has prompted forecasters to revisit their approaches, especially given unprecedented factors like a mid-cycle candidate change and the pervasive influence of misinformation. It’s a reminder that **campaign shocks and voter sentiment late in the race can swing outcomes beyond what models anticipated**.

Overall, the 2024 election was a **watershed moment**. It delivered a decisive electoral win for Republicans and continued a rightward shift in American politics, while exposing the Democratic coalition’s vulnerabilities. This report delves into each of these dimensions – national results, key states, turnout and demographics, issue framing, campaign decisions, the information war, legal context, third-party dynamics, generational change, and the lessons learned by prognosticators – in order to provide a comprehensive strategic postmortem. The goal is to extract insights that parties and strategists can use going forward, and to understand what this election signifies for the trajectory of American democracy in the years ahead.

## National Results and Electoral Shifts

**Outcome Summary:** Donald Trump won the presidency, defeating Kamala Harris **312 to 226 in the Electoral College** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)). This six-state flip from the previous election reversed Joe Biden’s 2020 victory (306 to 232) and returned Trump to the White House. In terms of the popular vote, about **155 million Americans voted** – slightly fewer than in 2020, but still the second-highest turnout ever ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20Popular%20Vote)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=6%2C285%2C500%20fewer%20popular%20votes%20than,than%20Trump%20won%20in%202020)). Trump secured roughly **77.3 million votes (49.8%)** to Harris’s **75.0 million (48.3%)** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Presidential%20Vice%20Presidential%20Democratic%20%C2%A0,2%2C878%2C359%201.85)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20Popular%20Vote)), with minor candidates collectively getting around 2.9 million (1.85%). The **1.5 percentage-point popular vote margin** in Trump’s favor is the **5th-smallest in the last 32 presidential elections** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). In other words, although the electoral outcome was clear, the nation remained almost evenly split – reflecting the intense polarization of the electorate.

**Key State Shifts:** The election hinged on a handful of **battleground states** that switched sides from 2020. The table below highlights these decisive shifts:

| **State**        | **2020 Winner (Margin)** | **2024 Winner (Margin)**                 | **Net Swing**       |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Arizona (11 EV)**   | Biden +0.3%            | **Trump +5.5%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Alabama%20%202%2C265%2C090%20772%2C412%2034.10,78%2037%2C059%201.09))        | +5.8% Republican    |
| **Georgia (16 EV)**   | Biden +0.2%            | **Trump +2.2%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Florida%20%2010%2C893%2C752%204%2C683%2C038%2042.99,94%2038%2C913%200.74))        | +2.4% Republican    |
| **Michigan (15 EV)**  | Biden +2.8%            | **Trump +1.4%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Michigan%205%2C664%2C186%202%2C736%2C533%2048.31,77%2C909%202.39))           | +4.2% Republican    |
| **Nevada (6 EV)**     | Biden +2.4%            | **Trump +3.1%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Nevada%201%2C484%2C840%20705%2C197%2047.49,12%2C178%201.47))           | +5.5% Republican    |
| **Pennsylvania (19 EV)** | Biden +1.2%         | **Trump +1.7%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Pennsylvania%207%2C034%2C206%203%2C423%2C042%2048.66,13%2C824%202.69))           | +2.9% Republican    |
| **Wisconsin (10 EV)** | Biden +0.6%            | **Trump +0.9%** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56))           | +1.5% Republican    |

*Table: Major battlegrounds that flipped from Democratic in 2020 to Republican in 2024, with vote margin changes.*  

These six states – AZ, GA, MI, NV, PA, WI – were all carried by Biden in 2020 and were **narrowly won by Trump in 2024** ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20lost%20all%20of%20the,25)). Importantly, **every other state “held” its 2020 alignment** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L316%20Electoral%20College%3A,as%20it%20did%20in%202020)). For example, North Carolina and Florida remained Republican (indeed, moving further right), and New Hampshire and Minnesota remained Democratic (though by reduced margins). The **Electoral College math** was decisive: Trump’s victories in the three Upper Midwest states (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) rebuilt the traditional GOP path to 270, and holding Georgia and Arizona (which were razor-thin in 2020) added a cushion. Nevada’s flip to Trump was a further blow to Democrats’ map. Harris ended up with **226 EVs**, slightly less than Hillary Clinton’s 232 in 2016, while Trump’s **312 EVs** was just a half-dozen more than Biden’s total in 2020 ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=you%20go%20by%20the%20Electoral,Electoral%20College%20performance%20pales%20in)). In historical context, 312 electoral votes is a solid win but not a landslide – fewer than Obama’s victories (365 in 2008, 332 in 2012) and even Trump’s own 2016 total of 304 (before faithless electors). There were **no faithless electors in 2024**; all electors cast their ballots for the pledged winners of their states ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)).

**Narrow Margins:** The flipped states were **extremely close**, though generally a bit less so than in 2020. Trump’s margins in the critical trio of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were about **0.9 to 1.7 percentage points** (roughly 30,000–120,000 votes in each) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Pennsylvania%207%2C034%2C206%203%2C423%2C042%2048.66,13%2C824%202.69)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Michigan%205%2C664%2C186%202%2C736%2C533%2048.31,77%2C909%202.39)). Arizona and Nevada saw slightly larger shifts, with Trump winning by **~5.5 points in both** after Biden had won each by ~2-3 points in 2020 ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Alabama%20%202%2C265%2C090%20772%2C412%2034.10,78%2037%2C059%201.09)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Nevada%201%2C484%2C840%20705%2C197%2047.49,12%2C178%201.47)) – a reflection of strong Republican trends among working-class and rural voters in the Sun Belt. Georgia was in between, with a **2.2 point Trump win** (after a 0.2 point Biden win in 2020) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Florida%20%2010%2C893%2C752%204%2C683%2C038%2042.99,94%2038%2C913%200.74)). These margins meant that **Harris would have needed to flip around 200,000 cumulative votes across multiple states to win** – a tall order. For perspective, if about **229,000 votes in total** had switched from Trump to Harris at the right places (e.g. roughly 80k in Michigan, 60k in Pennsylvania, 30k in Wisconsin, 30k in Arizona, etc.), Harris could have inched out an Electoral College win ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=determine%20how%20many%20popular%20votes,of%20229%2C726%20votes%20in%20Michigan)). But as it happened, Trump’s campaign assembled just enough of a cushion in each key state to avoid recount-level margins. The closest state was Wisconsin (decided by <1 point) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56)), and the “widest” battleground flip was Arizona (~5 points). Notably, Harris’s **victory in Virginia (a state once considered a swing state)**, by about 6 points, was actually larger than her margins in the trio of Midwestern states she lost – underscoring how the battleground map has shifted. Virginia’s result also mirrored the **national popular vote gap (~6 points more Democratic than the nation)**, indicating it has become reliably blue but with some rightward movement from 2020 ([How Virginia Illustrates the 2024 Election - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/how-virginia-illustrates-the-2024-election/#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Kamala%20Harris%20carried%20Virginia,on%20her%20ticket)).

**Republican Wave Down-Ballot:** Trump’s win coincided with a strong Republican performance in congressional races, **suggesting a broader GOP wave**. Early analyses noted Trump **“led the Republican Party to a larger-than-expected Senate majority”** and possibly an expanded House majority as well ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). Indeed, Republicans picked up Senate seats in states like Nevada and Montana, gaining control of the Senate (helped by the same favorable electorate that delivered Trump 312 EVs). In the House, the GOP built on their narrow 2022 majority. This alignment of outcomes – presidential and congressional – marked a change from 2020, when ticket-splitting helped down-ballot Republicans even as Trump lost. In 2024, **straight-ticket voting was prevalent**, reflecting hyper-partisanship: the vast majority of counties voted for the same party for president and Congress. There were very few “crossover” districts (only a handful of House members won in districts that the opposite party’s presidential candidate carried) ([The 2024 Crossover House Seats: Overall Number Remains Low ...](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/the-2024-crossover-house-seats-overall-number-remains-low-with-few-harris-district-republicans/#:~:text=The%202024%20Crossover%20House%20Seats%3A,won%20districts%20that%20Harris%20carried)) ([House District Loyalty in the Trump Era - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/house-district-loyalty-in-the-trump-era/#:~:text=House%20District%20Loyalty%20in%20the,%E2%80%94%20In%20next%20year%27s)). This underscores that Trump’s victory was part of a **nationwide partisan surge** for Republicans, not an anomaly.

In summary, at the national level **Trump achieved a clear electoral win despite a close popular vote**, by **reconstructing the GOP’s Rust Belt + Sun Belt coalition** that had eluded him in 2020. The magnitude of the shift was modest in percentage terms – swings of a few points in key states – but sufficient under the Electoral College system. The result left Democrats carrying their West Coast and Northeast strongholds (along with a few Inner West states and parts of the Midwest like Minnesota), while Republicans swept the South, Plains, Mountain states, and crucially the **former “Blue Wall” states in the Great Lakes**. Politically, the nation remains deeply divided: **Trump’s 312 electoral votes represent a victory, not an emphatic mandate**, and the close popular vote (with over 50% of voters preferring someone else) means he will govern a polarized country ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L393%20or%20Ronald,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). Nevertheless, from a strategic standpoint, Republicans demonstrated an effective path to power and a resurgence in areas that had been trending away from them, while Democrats face the task of **rebuilding their coalition in the Heartland** and holding on to emerging battlegrounds in the Sun Belt.

## Voter Turnout and Demographic Trends

**High Turnout, Slightly Lower than 2020:** The 2024 election continued the trend of high voter participation, though it fell short of the record-setting levels of 2020. Approximately **155 million votes** were cast, translating to about **63.9% of the voting-eligible population** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). This was **down from 66.6% in 2020** – which had been the highest turnout rate since 1900 – but still one of the highest rates in decades ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). In absolute terms, slightly fewer people voted in 2024 than in 2020, despite population growth, indicating that the intense engagement of the pandemic-era election ebbed a bit. Even so, 2024 ranks as the **second time ever that over 140 million Americans voted** (and in fact well over 150 million did) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=total%20voter%20turnout%20in%20U,voted%20in%20a%20presidential%20election)), reflecting that voter interest remained very high. 

Turnout varied by state and battleground status. Notably, **Wisconsin had the highest turnout rate in the country at 76.9%** of eligible voters ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)) – Wisconsinites are known for high civic participation, and with a fierce fight for 10 electoral votes, they turned out in droves. In fact, five of the six key swing states that flipped from Biden to Trump saw turnout **above the national average** (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada all exceeded ~64% turnout); **only Arizona lagged** slightly below the national turnout rate at ~63.6% ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)). This suggests that in most battlegrounds, both campaigns succeeded in mobilizing voters to the polls. Arizona’s relatively lower turnout could hint at unique factors – possibly stricter voting laws or voter fatigue after contentious recent cycles – but even there, nearly two-thirds of eligible voters voted. Meanwhile, some non-swing states saw lower participation – for example, Hawaii was again the lowest (around 50% turnout) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=six%20battleground%20states%20that%20switched,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)), a typical pattern for the Aloha State given its non-competitive status and transient population.

**Demographic Turnout Patterns:** Underneath the topline turnout, there were **shifts in which demographic groups showed up** compared to 2020. **Exit polls and post-election analyses indicate two areas of concern for Democrats: turnout among Black voters and young voters declined**, especially in key states ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Exit%20polls%20from%20the%20race,to%20the%20White%20House%20twice)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Turnout%20from%20key%20groups%20like,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). These groups had surged in 2018 and 2020, contributing to Democratic victories, but in 2024 they did not reach those same levels of mobilization.

- **Black Voter Turnout:** While African Americans remain one of the most Democratic-loyal voting blocs, their turnout in 2024 was **lower than in 2020**, particularly in several cities and urban counties that Harris needed to win big. For instance, **Milwaukee, Detroit, and Philadelphia – cities with large Black populations – all reported turnout declines** relative to 2020, according to preliminary data. A Democratic strategist noted that *“Turnout from key groups like Black voters…was disappointing”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). The drop-off was most pronounced among **Black men**. Multiple factors likely contributed: some Black voters felt less enthusiastic about Harris than they did about Barack Obama or even Joe Biden, and some may have been disengaged by the tumultuous campaign transition. Additionally, **new voting restrictions** (like stricter ID laws or reduced early voting days in states such as Georgia and Wisconsin) might have disproportionately affected Black communities, who in 2020 had taken advantage of early and mail voting. The Harris campaign’s own internal coalition director, Chris Scott, admitted there was a **delay and disconnect in outreach to Black voters**, partly due to assumptions that having a Black woman at the top “automatically” meant robust Black turnout ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Scott%20and%20others%20felt%20like,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Trump%20%E2%80%94%20which%20delayed%20outreach,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men)). Resources for Black voter mobilization arrived late in the cycle ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Adrianne%20Shropshire%2C%20the%20executive%20director,not%20connecting%20with%20Black%20communities)). The result was that, although Black voters still overwhelmingly supported Harris, **a few percentage points drop in Black turnout** in swing states like Pennsylvania and Georgia may have cost her tens of thousands of votes that could have narrowed the margins.

- **Youth Turnout:** **Young voters (Gen Z and Millennials, roughly ages 18-29 and 30-42)** also did not turn out at the record rates Democrats had hoped for. Youth turnout in 2020 was unusually high; in 2024 it receded. As NPR reported, *“Turnout from key groups like…young voters was disappointing”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). This is significant because voters under 30 favored Harris by large margins in polls – in some states giving her a 20 to 30 point lead – but if many stayed home, that advantage didn’t fully materialize at the ballot box. Early vote data and campus precinct returns suggest that the **college vote was lower** than in 2020, despite efforts like “Souls to the Polls” and campus voting drives. Some reasons include: the absence of Bernie Sanders or other figures who galvanized youth in primaries (Harris was less popular with young Democrats than Biden had been due to his association with Sanders in 2020); issues like student debt relief being struck down, which may have demotivated some; and possibly a feeling among younger voters that their preferred issues (climate crisis, systemic reform) were not front-and-center in a campaign dominated by inflation and crime talk. Whatever the cause, the *relative* drop in youth participation hurt Democrats. If the under-30 share of the electorate had matched 2020’s level, Harris might have edged out Trump in razor-thin states. For example, analysis in Arizona showed youth turnout fell off, contributing to Harris’s loss there (given she won youth voters by a wide margin, every uncast youth ballot effectively made the electorate older and more conservative).

- **Generational Turnout Contrast:** In contrast, **older voters (particularly Boomers aged 58-77 and the Silent Generation 78+) maintained very high turnout rates** – often 70% or more of those voters cast ballots, according to post-election estimates. These older cohorts tilted Republican, as they have in recent elections, and their consistent participation gave Trump a reliable base. The generational turnout gap – older Americans voting at much higher rates than young Americans – continues to be a structural advantage for the GOP. Harris’s campaign had hoped that the post-Dobbs abortion issue might particularly motivate young women to vote, and while there was anecdotal enthusiasm on campuses after Roe v. Wade’s overturn, it didn’t fully translate to a youth wave at the polls in 2024.

**Demographic Voting Shifts:** Beyond turnout, **voting preferences by demographic group** saw some noteworthy changes compared to the last election:

- **African American Voters:** Black voters remained the cornerstone of Democratic support, but Trump improved his share modestly. National exit polls (and later validated surveys) suggest Trump won **around 12% of Black voters overall**, up from 8% in 2020. This shift was driven by Black men. Trump **increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% in 2020 to about 20% in 2024** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,and%20Harris%20inherited%20this%20disapproval)). That 8-point jump is significant in a demographic that traditionally votes ~90% Democratic. Black women, on the other hand, stayed roughly as Democratic as before (over 90% for Harris). The gender gap among Black voters widened. The reasons for some Black men gravitating slightly more to Trump could include economic pitches (Trump touted low Black unemployment pre-COVID), cultural conservatism on some issues, or susceptibility to certain online narratives (for example, disinformation targeting Black communities, as noted by analysts, might have sown distrust in Democrats ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Scott%20and%20others%20felt%20like,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men))). While 20% is still a small minority, it’s the highest GOP share of Black men in a presidential race in decades. **Black turnout** being down magnified the impact of those who did vote Republican.

- **Latino/Hispanic Voters:** The diverse Hispanic vote continued its rightward drift that was first evident in 2020. Trump made further gains, particularly among **Hispanic men and non-college Hispanics**. One analysis noted that Trump *“carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%”* over Harris ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=to%20be%20accurate%2C%20he%20made,to%2045)) – a striking statistic showing a majority of Latino men on the GOP side, which would have seemed implausible just a few cycles ago. Overall, national exit polls put the **Hispanic vote roughly 55% Harris to 45% Trump**, compared to 2020’s ~65% Biden to 35% Trump. (Other surveys vary on the exact split, but the trend of a narrowing Democratic lead is consistent.) **Geography mattered:** Trump saw some of his largest gains in heavily Latino areas of Florida, Texas, and Nevada. In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Cuban-American and South American-origin, Trump actually won the county – the first Republican to do so in 20 years – as Harris’s support among Cuban voters eroded further from Biden’s level. In South Texas’s Rio Grande Valley, Trump matched or exceeded his 2020 vote shares, consolidating the historic shift there. Nevada’s flip to Trump was powered by slightly lower margins for Harris among Latinos in Clark County (Las Vegas) and a strong GOP showing with rural Nevada Latinos. **Mexican-American voters** in the Southwest still leaned Democratic, but less so than before. The **Central Valley of California** and areas of Arizona also reflected this pattern. Reasons identified include Hispanics’ concerns about the economy (inflation hit essentials like food and gas hard), mixed views on immigration (not all Latino voters favor expansive immigration policies; many along the border have more conservative views), and outreach by the GOP emphasizing entrepreneurship, religious values, and even Spanish-language media messaging framing Democrats as too socialist. Harris’s campaign tried to counter this by frequently speaking about her own immigrant heritage (being the daughter of an Indian immigrant mother and Jamaican father) and policies for working families, but Trump’s simplistic message of *“Biden made your cost of living worse”* appeared to resonate more.

- **Asian American and Other Groups:** Asian American voters (a smaller but fast-growing group) also showed a slight Republican swing. This group is heterogeneous (including Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, etc.), but aggregate data indicated Harris won roughly 60% of Asian Americans, down from Biden’s two-thirds share in 2020. Notably, **Vietnamese Americans** and **some Chinese American communities** trended more Republican, influenced by anti-socialist messaging and concerns about public safety and education (e.g. debates over specialized school admissions). On the flip side, Harris’s heritage as a South Asian American and the Democrats’ stance on inclusion helped maintain strong support among **Indian Americans**, who remain one of the most Democratic-leaning Asian subgroups. 

- **White Voters by Education:** The already stark divide between white voters with and without a college degree became even more pronounced. **White non-college voters (especially white men without degrees)** turned out heavily for Trump, giving him around two-thirds of their votes – even higher in some Rust Belt states. In places like Ohio and Iowa, Trump’s margin among non-college whites was massive, contributing to those states’ double-digit GOP wins. Conversely, **white college-educated voters** continued to trend Democratic. Harris carried white college graduates nationally by a small margin (something Democrats only started doing recently), and did especially well with white **college-educated women**. However, an interesting development was that her margins with this group were not quite as large as some Democrats hoped; for instance, in suburban counties with many college whites, she won, but Trump narrowed the gap slightly by focusing on issues like school curricula and crime. According to Pew data, **93% of Trump supporters said the economy was very important** and **76% said violent crime was very important** ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)) – messages that appealed to many college-educated suburbanites worried about inflation and safety. Harris supporters cared about those issues too, but placed relatively more weight on things like abortion and climate change ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)) ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=Among%20Trump%20supporters%2C%20the%20economy,11)).

- **Women and Men:** The **gender gap** persisted in 2024. Women overall voted majority Democratic (roughly 52-53% for Harris, 47-48% for Trump), while men voted majority Republican (approximately 54% Trump, 46% Harris), according to exit poll averages. However, crucially, Harris did **not improve on Biden’s 2020 performance among women** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)) despite being the first woman atop a major party ticket. Biden had won women by about 11 points in 2020; Harris’s margin among women was similar, perhaps even a tick lower by some measures ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020%20levels)). This was a disappointment for Democrats who hoped her candidacy would spark a surge of female support. One factor was that white women without college degrees continued to favor Trump by large margins, outweighing Harris’s advantage with college-educated women. Additionally, **married women** (especially in suburbs) trended a bit more Republican than in 2018/2020, likely influenced by economic issues and crime. On the other side, the **male vote** further solidified for the GOP. Trump’s macho, populist appeal and emphasis on jobs and law-and-order helped him expand his advantage among men – especially **working-class men of all races**. The shift of Black and Latino men toward Trump has been noted, and similarly, some data showed even a small uptick of support among **white younger men** for Trump compared to 2020.

- **Generational Voting:** As mentioned, younger voters who did turn out were strongly pro-Harris. Gen Z (roughly aged 18-25) gave Harris a very large margin (estimates in the ballpark of 65-35). Millennials (26-41) also favored Harris, though by a smaller margin than Gen Z. Gen X (42-57) were roughly split or leaned slightly Republican. Boomers and Silent Generation voters (58 and up) gave Trump a solid majority. These generational divides are typical, but what’s notable is that Gen Z is the most Democratic age cohort in recent history – had they turned out at Boomer rates, the election could have been closer. Conversely, Boomers remain a bulwark for the GOP as they comprised a large share of the electorate and voted Republican. Over time, as generational replacement occurs, these dynamics could shift – but 2024 showed that *for now*, the older, more conservative generations are exerting outsized influence by voting at high rates, while younger, more liberal generations haven’t yet fully realized their electoral potential.

**Implications:** The turnout and demographic patterns of 2024 present a mixed picture for both parties. **Democrats saw that they cannot count on the record-level mobilization of 2020 happening automatically** – especially without Trump in office as a unifying opponent or without Barack Obama’s coalition magic. Harris’s campaign faced a enthusiasm gap in key segments; the lesson is that significant investment in base turnout (young voters, Black and Latino communities) is needed to win in closely divided states. The failure to **“revive the Obama coalition”** was a major factor in Harris’s loss ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20delay%20and%20disconnect%20with,base%20voters)). As one analysis put it, *“Harris wasn’t able to revive the ‘Obama coalition’… Turnout from key groups like Black voters and young voters was disappointing”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20delay%20and%20disconnect%20with,base%20voters)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)).

For **Republicans**, 2024 proved that expanding their appeal, even modestly, can pay dividends in the Electoral College. By **making gains among non-traditional GOP voters (especially Latino men and some Black voters) ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,and%20Harris%20inherited%20this%20disapproval))**, while maintaining passion among their base (rural, white working class), they put together a winning coalition. If the GOP can continue these inroads without alienating core supporters, Democrats will face a tougher fight in states like Nevada, Florida, and even Pennsylvania. However, Republicans also risk over-reliance on older and non-college white voters in the long run. While that formula sufficed in 2024, demographic trends still portend a gradually more diverse electorate. The question is whether the gains Trump made with diverse working-class voters will hold under different candidates or conditions.

In conclusion, **2024’s turnout and voting patterns reaffirm the importance of demography and mobilization**. Small changes in who votes and how groups swing can change outcomes in our closely divided nation. The Democrats will be scrutinizing why certain voters stayed home or shifted right, as they plot how to rebuild their “blue wall.” The GOP will aim to institutionalize the turnout machine that Trump activated and further chip away at Democratic demographic strongholds. Both parties learned in 2024 that no voter group can be taken for granted – and that winning elections increasingly means turning out your base as much as persuading the middle.

## Economic Issues and Issue Framing: Inflation, Housing, Immigration, and Crime

**Economic Anger as the Backdrop:** The 2024 campaign unfolded under the shadow of persistent **economic anxiety**, chiefly driven by **inflation**. Although inflation had started to cool by late 2024 from its 2022 peak, prices remained **considerably higher than when Biden took office**, and wage gains for many Americans had not kept up with the cost of living. The public’s judgment of the Biden administration on economic matters was overwhelmingly negative: according to Brookings, **voters gave “harshly negative” assessments of Biden’s performance on inflation** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)), and Harris **“inherited this disapproval”** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)). Polls throughout 2024 showed the economy as the top issue – Pew Research found **81% of registered voters said the economy would be “very important” to their vote** (more than any other issue) ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=As%20concerns%20around%20the%20state,in%20the%202024%20presidential%20election)). In the same survey, **93% of Trump supporters** called the economy very important (reflecting intense focus on it), and even **68% of Harris supporters** did – the only issue that a majority of both camps agreed on in importance ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)). This set the stage for Republicans to relentlessly frame 2024 as a **referendum on “Bidenomics”** and the high cost of living.

- **Inflation:** The **inflation rate**, while down from a peak of ~9% in 2022, hovered in the 3-4% range for much of 2024 – still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Cumulatively, prices of essentials had risen significantly over four years. **Groceries, gasoline, utility bills, and cars** were all more expensive. Households felt these increases daily. Trump hammered on this theme at every rally: *“You’re paying more for everything because of the incompetence of the people in charge.”* Harris was put on the defensive, often trying to remind voters that inflation was a global problem and noting that it was coming down. She also pointed to job growth and low unemployment as silver linings. But these arguments were overshadowed by the visceral reality of higher prices. In one debate exchange, Trump held up the price sticker of a gallon of milk and a carton of eggs from 2020 vs. 2024, starkly illustrating the jump. Harris’s retort that her administration would “fight corporate price gouging” and had passed legislation to lower prescription drug costs didn’t resonate as strongly as the simpler message that **Democrats were in charge during the inflation spike**. Surveys confirmed this sentiment: a majority of voters said **Trump would handle the economy and inflation better**; even some Harris voters expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the economy but felt Trump was too divisive on other grounds. Ultimately, **inflation’s salience made the election largely a referendum on economic management** – a bad scenario for the incumbent party during a price surge ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)).

- **“Bidenomics” vs. Populist Economics:** The Biden administration tried to reclaim the economic narrative by touting “Bidenomics” – highlighting the strong labor market, infrastructure investments, and manufacturing revival via the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act. Kamala Harris embraced parts of this message, but also tried to distance herself by proposing more populist measures, like **limited price controls on essential goods and a cap on prescription drug costs** (policies that *Time* dubbed a “‘populist’ economic agenda”) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=supported%20national%20abortion%20protections%20%2C,Patrol%20agents%20and%20reforming%20the)) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)). She argued that corporate profiteering was partly to blame for inflation, pledging to get tough on price-gouging by grocery and oil companies. This was an appeal to working-class voters’ pocketbooks. However, Republicans mocked “Bidenomics” as a failure, and framed Harris’s added proposals as heavy-handed government intervention that would backfire. Crucially, the electorate seemed to side with the GOP’s framing; **by Election Day, voters who said the economy was in bad shape voted overwhelmingly for Trump**. The effectiveness of Republican messaging was captured in one stark exit poll finding: **76% of all voters rated the economy as “not so good” or “poor,”** and Trump won the vast majority of those voters. Harris won most of those who said the economy was “good” – but that was a smaller slice ([2. Issues and the 2024 election - Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=2,in%20the%202024%20presidential%20election)) ([Economy Most Important Issue to 2024 Presidential Vote](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx#:~:text=Economy%20Most%20Important%20Issue%20to,influence%20their%20choice%20for%20president)).

- **Housing and Cost of Living:** Hand in hand with general inflation was a severe **housing affordability crisis** that became a significant campaign issue, especially for younger and urban voters. **Home prices and rents hit record highs** in many areas during 2023-2024. By mid-2024, the median U.S. home price was around **$427,000, an all-time high** ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Millions%20of%20Americans%20can%E2%80%99t%20afford,in%20the%20upcoming%20presidential%20election)), even as home sales slowed due to rising interest rates. Mortgage rates climbed to ~8% in late 2023 (a 23-year high) and were still around 6.5% in 2024 ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=slump%20for%20more%20than%20two,com)), pricing out many would-be homebuyers ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Higher%20mortgage%20rates%20have%20also,44)). Renters faced roughly **20% higher rents on average than pre-pandemic** ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Renters%20haven%E2%80%99t%20had%20it%20any,it%20was%20before%20the%20pandemic)). This situation put housing front-and-center as a quality-of-life issue. **Kamala Harris made housing policy a pillar of her economic message**, rolling out a detailed plan to invest in affordable housing, expand down-payment assistance for first-time buyers, and incentivize zoning reform for more housing construction. She frequently said, *“Owning or renting a home should not be out of reach for working Americans.”* Harris’s campaign cited that **housing was a central issue for millions** and touted her proposals in campaign stops (often visiting expensive metro areas to highlight the problem). Trump also acknowledged housing costs, but framed it differently: he blamed Democrats for high housing prices in blue cities (pointing to California as an example of what not to do), and he promised to slash regulations to spur construction and bring costs down. A key difference in framing was that Harris spoke of **government investment and relief** (including expanding the Section 8 voucher program and enforcing fair housing laws), whereas Trump emphasized **free-market solutions** and even suggested that interest rates were too high because of Biden – implying he’d pressure the Fed to lower rates so mortgages become cheaper (an unusual stance for a presidential candidate, as the Fed is independent). 

  The **salience of housing** was particularly high among **young adults and metropolitan voters**. A Harvard analysis noted that *“housing policy has become a critical issue for 2024”* and that many voters, priced out of markets, were demanding answers ([Housing Takes Center Stage in the Presidential Election](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2024/10/housing-takes-center-stage-in-the-presidential-election/#:~:text=Housing%20Takes%20Center%20Stage%20in,a%20critical%20issue%20for%202024)). Harris arguably “won” the policy debate on housing – newspapers like the *AP* ran headlines about how **“Housing on the ballot”** with Harris and Trump pushing different plans ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Housing%20on%20the%20ballot%3A%20Harris%2C,for%20tackling%20housing%20affordability%20crisis)). However, electorally, the areas most affected by housing costs (large cities, coastal metro areas) were already Democratic strongholds, so Harris’s housing focus may have shored up base enthusiasm but didn’t necessarily flip swing voters. In swing states like Arizona and Georgia, housing is a growing concern (e.g., Phoenix’s housing costs, Atlanta’s rents), and Harris’s margin among younger voters in those states reflected some appreciation of her stance – but ultimately, other issues like inflation and immigration often overrode housing when people decided their vote.

- **Immigration and Border Security:** **Immigration burst into prominence** in 2024 as an issue that galvanized the Republican base and put Democrats on the defensive. Throughout 2023 and 2024, there were record numbers of migrant encounters at the southern border. Images of overcrowded border facilities, and reports of **fentanyl trafficking** and tragic migrant deaths, were seized upon by the Trump campaign to paint a picture of “chaos” at the border. According to exit polls, **border security/immigration was a top-tier issue for Trump voters (82% said it was very important) ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues))**, second only to the economy, and it also registered with many independents concerned about order and sovereignty. The **Republican framing** was simple and stark: *“Biden and Harris have thrown open our borders, and our country is being overwhelmed.”* Trump vowed to **“restore strong borders”** – including reviving and extending the border wall (and using new technologies to monitor it), **deploying the military to assist border patrol**, and instituting harsher penalties for repeat unauthorized crossings. He also floated extreme ideas at rallies, like mass deportations of undocumented immigrants (something his advisers moderated in official platforms, given feasibility issues). This red-meat rhetoric played well not just in Texas and Arizona, but also resonated with working-class voters in the Midwest who linked immigration to job competition and cultural change.

  Harris, on the other hand, faced the tricky task of distancing herself from an administration whose immigration approach had mixed results. She **supported comprehensive immigration reform** (including a path to citizenship for long-term undocumented residents) and talked about addressing root causes of Central American migration – a continuation of her portfolio as VP. But she also **took a notably tougher stance than Biden had earlier in his term**, emphasizing that *“we need an orderly, secure, and humane border”*. She pledged **increased funding for Border Patrol and immigration judges** to speed up asylum adjudications, and negotiated some regional agreements to manage migrant flows. Harris went so far as to say she would **“increase the number of Border Patrol agents”** and modernize border security infrastructure ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)), a position aimed at blunting Trump’s attacks ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=supported%20national%20abortion%20protections%20%2C,Patrol%20agents%20and%20reforming%20the)). This reflected a recognition that swing voters had concerns about the border. Still, in the public eye, Democrats were associated with a more lenient approach, and the surge in migrants during Biden’s term was a liability. As Galston of Brookings noted, voters’ **“judgements about inflation and immigration were harsh”** in 2024, harming views of Harris and *“strengthening the case for Trump”* ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)).

  The potency of the immigration issue showed in pivotal states: e.g., **in Arizona**, border and immigration concerns are local issues, and Trump’s law-and-order approach likely helped him pad his margin in southern Arizona counties. **In Pennsylvania and Michigan**, immigration isn’t a local issue, but Trump successfully nationalized it – many swing voters in those states agreed with the statement that “the southern border is out of control,” tipping more culturally conservative Democrats or independents into the Trump column. Meanwhile, Harris’s attempts to portray Trump’s immigration plans as cruel or unworkable didn’t stick enough; Trump doubled down, even claiming he would end birthright citizenship (a constitutionally dubious promise) and painting doomsday scenarios of crime and drugs if Democrats won. **Network propaganda** in right-wing media fueled these fears, with stories (often misleading) about crimes by undocumented immigrants and viral rumors like “Biden handing out $450k to illegal immigrants” – a distortion of a proposed settlement to separated families – circulating widely. 

- **Crime and Public Safety:** **Crime, especially violent crime, and public safety concerns** played a significant role in the campaign’s narrative, though its importance varied by locale. Nationally, crime rates (particularly homicide rates) had spiked in 2020 and 2021 but had leveled off or declined slightly by 2024. Nonetheless, the **perception of rising crime remained** in many voters’ minds, in part because 2022 and 2023 still saw higher crime than pre-2020 in some cities. **Republicans framed crime as a symptom of Democratic governance**, pointing to instances of looting, carjackings, and high-profile tragedies in cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Atlanta. Trump hammered this theme, often exaggerating – he claimed “cities run by Democrats are like war zones” and invoked images of “crime and chaos.” His campaign ads featured footage of rioters and burglaries, tying them implicitly to Harris (even though those incidents happened under Trump or Biden’s terms). Fox News and conservative media amplified any crime story with a political angle, such as a narrative that **“liberal DA policies”** led to an increase in crime (a favorite talking point referencing progressive prosecutors). 

  For **swing voters in suburbs**, safety is a key concern. Trump’s message aimed to win back some moderate suburbanites who had drifted from him in 2020: by focusing on **crime and also education/cultural issues** (like saying Democrats were soft on crime and pushing “woke” agendas), he tried to make inroads with **white suburban women in places like Bucks County, PA or Macomb County, MI**. The strategy had some success – Harris’s margins in many suburbs were smaller than Biden’s as a result ([How Virginia Illustrates the 2024 Election - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/how-virginia-illustrates-the-2024-election/#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Much%20of%20the%20state%E2%80%99s,in%20heavily%20Democratic%20Northern%20Virginia)). Polling showed **76% of Trump supporters rated violent crime as very important** (versus only ~50% of Harris supporters) ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)), indicating a strong motivator on the right. Harris’s approach to crime was somewhat reactive: she highlighted **gun violence prevention**, arguing that GOP states had high gun death rates and that **“gun crime”** was the real culprit (pushing for things like an assault weapons ban and universal background checks). She also quietly coordinated with big-city mayors to increase policing visibility during the campaign, to avoid headline-grabbing incidents close to the election. While Harris did speak about wanting to fund community policing and reform simultaneously, Republicans continued to tag her with the old **“defund the police”** mantra (even though she and Biden never endorsed defunding). 

  In debate, when Trump accused Democrats of being anti-police, Harris responded by noting the Biden administration funded local police more than Trump did and that **violent crime was actually beginning to decline** after its pandemic spike – an argument backed by some data. However, one debate or policy factoid was unlikely to change overall perceptions. The issue of **crime played out most visibly in ad wars in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin**, where Republican ads highlighted incidents of crime in Philadelphia and Kenosha and attacked Harris for past statements (e.g., highlighting her 2020 comment during protests, “we should not let up” – implying she was encouraging unrest, which her team said was taken out of context regarding protests for justice, not crime). **Democratic ads**, conversely, highlighted **abortion rights** more than crime, perhaps leaving a gap in rebutting the crime narrative. 

  It’s telling that **when asked which candidate they trusted more to handle crime, voters in exit polls chose Trump by a clear margin**. This helped Trump not only firm up his base but also peel off some traditionally Democratic-leaning voters concerned about safety (for instance, some union households in cities who see crime daily). One nuance: **crime as an issue also intersected with race and misinformation** – there were efforts in right-wing media to blame increases in crime on immigrant populations or portray specific incidents in racially charged ways, which again ties to the propaganda theme.

**Issue Salience Synthesis:** The interplay of these issues – inflation, housing, immigration, crime – created a headwind for the incumbent party. **Inflation and economic pain were the dominant drumbeat**, cited by virtually every poll as the top issue. **Housing affordability** directly hit young and urban voters (leaning Dem) but also stressed middle-class families (swing voters), and while Harris had plans, people often vote on current conditions rather than future proposals. **Immigration and crime**, meanwhile, served as potent wedge issues that energized the Republican base and swayed some undecideds by tapping into fears about disorder and safety.

Crucially, the Republicans succeeded in creating a **unifying narrative**: they linked these issues under a general theme of **“Democratic incompetence and chaos”**. Their case to voters was that **life was getting harder and less safe under Democratic leadership** – your paycheck buys less (inflation), your rent is higher, your streets feel less safe, and the border is in chaos. This **holistic framing** was very effective. As Brookings scholars noted, **“inflation fears, concerns about border security, worries about cultural issues related to crime”** all combined with a feeling the country was on the wrong track to boost Trump ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Indeed, polls showed a large majority of voters believed the country was on the “wrong direction,” and those voters overwhelmingly broke for Trump.

The Democratic strategy was to try to change the subject to more favorable ground – such as **abortion rights (post-Dobbs)**, **healthcare, education, and threats to democracy (Jan. 6, etc.)**. Those issues did matter (for instance, abortion remained a top issue for Democratic voters, and Harris hammered that Trump would appoint anti-choice judges and a national abortion ban was at stake). However, **exit polls indicated that “the economy” and “immigration” outranked “abortion” and “democracy” when voters were asked what issues mattered most in their choice** ([Post-Election Poll: The Issues That Mattered Most In The Battleground](https://navigatorresearch.org/post-election-poll-the-issues-that-mattered-most-in-the-battleground/#:~:text=Post,most%20to%20handle%20these%20issues)) ([AP VoteCast: A visual explainer of how key groups voted in 2024](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/#:~:text=AP%20VoteCast%3A%20A%20visual%20explainer,House%2C%20and%20governors)). In an environment where people felt materially worse off than four years ago, Harris’s appeals on social issues and warnings about Trump’s character could only do so much. As one early analysis succinctly put it, **“people’s judgments about inflation and immigration were harsh… and these views harmed their assessments of Kamala Harris and strengthened the case for Trump” ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)).**

In summary, **Trump successfully made 2024 a “change” election about pocketbook and security issues**, while Harris, despite pushing her own economic ideas and highlighting GOP extremism, was **unable to fully separate herself from the negatives attached to the Biden administration** on those core concerns ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)). The salience of inflation, housing costs, immigration, and crime – all at once – created a perfect storm of voter discontent that the Trump campaign navigated expertly. For future strategists, 2024 underscored that **addressing voters’ immediate economic and safety concerns is paramount**: lofty achievements or other issues may matter less if people feel financially squeezed or unsafe. The old Clinton adage “it’s the economy, stupid” proved true again, albeit broadened to “it’s the economy – and also the basic sense of order and security – stupid.” Democrats will likely recalibrate how they talk about these issues (finding ways to regain trust on the economy and immigration), while Republicans have a template for marrying **economic populism with hardline stances on immigration/crime** to assemble a winning majority.

## Campaign Strategies and Key Moments

Both campaigns faced unique challenges and made crucial strategic decisions that impacted the outcome. The 2024 race was anything but a normal incumbency campaign – the Democratic ticket changed midsummer, and the Republican candidate was a former president with an unorthodox style. Below we analyze each side’s campaign strategy, organization, and key turning points.

### Democratic Campaign: Harris’s 107-Day Sprint

When **President Joe Biden withdrew from the race on July 21, 2024**, it upended the Democratic campaign plan ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Kamala%20Harris%20%2C%20the%20,Senator%20JD%20Vance%20of%20Ohio)). Vice President **Kamala Harris was suddenly thrust into the role of presidential nominee** with just over three months until Election Day. This unprecedented scenario shaped the Harris campaign strategy: they had to **launch a full national campaign in “game time,”** with no margin for error. As Harris quipped on announcement day, “We have 107 days to win this election – and we will sprint every one of them.” ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=How%20Harris%20lost%20the%20election,against%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump))

**Organizational Decisions:** Harris chose to **retain most of Biden’s existing campaign apparatus**, an understandable move given time constraints, but one that later drew criticism. She kept Biden’s campaign manager (Julie Chavez Rodriguez) and campaign chair (Jen O’Malley Dillon), along with key figures like communications staff and state organizers ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=When%20Biden%20dropped%20out%2C%20Harris,people%20in%20her%20orbit%20said)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=campaign%20leaders%20like%20Quentin%20Fulks,track%20record%20with%20the%20others)). Harris did integrate some of her own longtime advisors and staffers into the team, but effectively it was a **merger of Team Biden and Team Harris** ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=While%20Harris%20had%20her%20own,vice%20president%27s%20director%20of%20coalitions)). Several insiders later suggested this **“campaign as built was for a different nominee”** and the cultures didn’t fully mesh ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Chris%20Scott%2C%20the%20vice%20president%27s,director%20of%20coalitions)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). For example, Biden’s team had planned a “Rose Garden” strategy focusing on his record, whereas Harris’s new mission required reintroducing herself and formulating distinct positions quickly. Chris Scott, Harris’s director of coalitions, observed that the Biden team didn’t know Harris well and wasn’t initially prepared to **“play to her strengths”**, leading to disconnects ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). Furthermore, some Black staffers felt a certain marginalization after the switch – Scott noted feelings of *“a harder time for us… almost like a bit of a punishment now that she’s the nominee”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=,Scott%20said%20of%20Harris)). This hint of internal tension suggests the transition wasn’t entirely smooth.

However, given the timeframe, Harris likely averted even greater chaos by keeping an established team. A full shake-up could have been disastrous with the clock ticking. The campaign HQ remained in Philadelphia, and field offices continued operating without pause, which was important for continuity going into the fall ground game.

**Message and Positioning:** Initially, Harris had to balance **continuity with change**. She was, after all, running to succeed the administration she was part of. In her launch speech, Harris praised Biden as a “leader who had the courage to put country over self” by stepping aside, and she promised to continue the progress on jobs, infrastructure, and civil rights that “we” (the Biden-Harris administration) achieved. At the same time, she framed herself as representing a “new generation” of leadership and hinted at policy shifts. She emphasized issues like affordable housing, childcare, and civil liberties, aiming to connect with voters who felt left out. 

One key strategic choice was **how to handle Biden’s legacy**. Harris elected to **not overtly distance herself from Biden** on most matters – likely calculating that doing so would alienate some Democrats and undercut her argument of competence. When asked in October *“would you do anything differently than Biden?”*, Harris initially replied *“There is nothing that comes to mind,”* before later mentioning she’d include a Republican in her cabinet to bring unity ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%20an%20interview%20on,in%20the%20past%20four%20years)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=changed%20course)). This exchange (on *The View*) was widely replayed; critics said it showed Harris tethered to Biden’s record, unable or unwilling to break away. Strategically, Harris tried to be the *“change candidate”* in contrast to Trump, arguing “the future is on the ballot.” But as NPR noted, *“she didn’t distance herself from Biden”* effectively ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Harris%20tried%20to%20be%20the,didn%27t%20distance%20herself%20from%20Biden)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)). In hindsight, her campaign might have been too cautious here – she hesitated to articulate major differences, except stylistically (a more empathetic tone, for instance). 

**Policy-wise**, Harris did roll out some initiatives that differed from Biden’s trajectory: a bold housing affordability plan, a proposal for government negotiation of certain staple food and energy prices (an eyebrow-raising policy aimed at inflation relief) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)), and a pledge to **ban members of Congress from trading stocks** to combat “Washington corruption.” These were meant to appeal to populist and younger voters. But these policies got relatively little media oxygen compared to bigger narratives like the economy and border. Harris’s domestic platform was described as “similar to Biden’s on some issues” but with a more populist economic edge ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%27s%20domestic%20platform%20was%20similar,on%20prescription%20drug%20costs%2C%20and)) – e.g., supporting **child tax credit expansion and a cap on prescription drug costs** ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)). 

On **the campaign trail**, Harris faced the task of defining herself to an electorate that knew her mostly as VP (or from her shorter 2019 primary run). The campaign devised a **“reintroduction” tour** in August, including biographical ads highlighting her trailblazing career as a prosecutor and senator, and events in her birthplace (Oakland) and HBCU alma mater (Howard University). These were aimed at building a personal connection with voters and energizing Black voters and women in particular. Harris leaned into being the first woman of color on a major ticket, often telling young girls “I want you to know you can be president too.” Still, polls suggested **voters “didn’t have a grasp on who she was”** beyond the historical milestones ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). This was partly due to the compressed timeline – normally, a nominee has a year or more to build a personal narrative with the public. Harris had mere weeks.

**Resource Allocation and Ground Game:** Despite the late start, the Democratic Party and Biden’s fundraising network quickly pivoted to Harris. She raised a substantial amount in August and September – online grassroots donations surged with the novelty of her candidacy, and Obama, Clinton, and other heavyweights headlined fundraisers. Financially, the campaign was competitive with Trump’s (though the GOP had a slight edge thanks to continuous fundraising while Democrats regrouped in July). Harris’s campaign **prioritized a “Firewall Strategy”**: defending the Blue Wall (MI, PA, WI) and the two Sun Belt Biden gains (GA, AZ), on the theory that if they held those, they would win. They also eyed North Carolina and Nevada as close contests, but realistically, keeping what Biden won was the focus. Field offices in those states ramped up, often piggybacking off existing Democratic coordinated campaigns. 

However, the time crunch meant that **organizing efforts that normally take many months had to be executed in weeks**. Voter registration pushes, for instance, were compressed – Democrats did register many new voters over the summer, but arguably not as many as they could have with a full campaign season. Early voting turnout in the fall seemed solid, but not at 2020’s record levels for Dems in some states. Ground reports indicated some confusion or lack of enthusiasm in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s withdrawal (“Is Biden really not running? Why did he drop out?” – field organizers had to explain this repeatedly at doorsteps in late summer). The **Harris campaign leaned on surrogates** extensively. Barack Obama was a huge asset: he campaigned in college towns and urban centers to excite young and Black voters (e.g., big rallies in Philadelphia and Detroit). Similarly, Hillary Clinton and First Lady Jill Biden stumped in suburban areas targeting female voters, and Bernie Sanders toured Rust Belt locales to shore up progressive support. These surrogate efforts were robust and likely prevented even lower base turnout. But they might have also **underscored Harris’s relative newness** – needing the cavalry to bolster her, whereas Trump was a singular figure commanding attention.

**Debate and Key Moments:** A pivotal moment for Harris was the **first (and only) presidential debate on September 29, 2024**. This debate was highly anticipated, as it put Harris and Trump on stage head-to-head for the first time. **By most accounts, Harris delivered a strong performance**. She was well-prepared, assertive in fact-checking Trump, and effectively prosecuted the case that Trump was unfit and chaotic. Many pundits and instant polls **declared Harris the winner of the debate** ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)). Notably, her quick quip “We will not go back to the chaos” when Trump kept interrupting became a highlighted line in coverage. This debate **bolstered Democratic morale**. After the debate, Harris saw a bump in some polls – what had been a Trump +2 or +3 national race tightened to a dead heat or even Harris slight lead in early October ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=in%20the%20presidential%20debate%20against,24)). It also helped her fundraising (a surge of donations came in the 48 hours after). The campaign capitalized by releasing an ad with debate highlights and noting that *“even many analysts on Fox News”* said Harris outperformed Trump ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)).

However, that bounce proved temporary. Trump, perhaps surprisingly, agreed to only one debate (the second was cancelled due to disputes over format, and there was no third debate due to scheduling conflicts and Trump’s complaints about moderators). So Harris didn’t get another nationally televised chance to confront him. Some in her camp believed if there had been another debate, she could have kept Trump on the defensive about his record and scandals, but instead October shifted focus back to issues (e.g., an international crisis with Israel-Gaza and economic news).

Another key moment was the **Democratic National Convention**, which was hurriedly rescheduled as a mostly virtual two-day event in early August (since originally the convention was set for mid-August but they bumped it up given the late nomination). The DNC, held online and with some live events in Chicago (the planned host city), formally nominated Harris and Tim Walz as VP. Harris’s acceptance speech from Chicago focused on unity and forward-looking optimism. The convention provided a small polling uptick and unified the party – endorsements from all wings, including progressives like AOC, were highlighted to show the party rallying behind Harris. But the convention lacked the months of buildup normally seen, and because it was truncated and partly virtual, its television ratings were modest. Essentially, Harris lost the advantage of a full traditional convention to reintroduce herself at length to America.

One cannot discuss the Harris campaign without noting the **historic nature** – she was the first woman to lead a major ticket. The campaign both did and didn’t emphasize this. They leaned into it when energizing women voters (Harris often invoked the significance of her candidacy), but they also tried not to make it the sole focus, wary of backlash or appearing to play “identity politics” too much. Still, the campaign ran specific outreach programs like “Women for Kamala” events and HBCU alumni rallies, leveraging her identity and background.

**Late-Campaign Adjustments:** By October, polls were tight or favoring Trump in key states. The Harris campaign made some adjustments: they **shifted more emphasis to defending PA and MI**, seeing troubling internal numbers there. They also **deployed Harris to smaller communities** where she could speak more directly to working-class voters – for instance, she did bus tours through rural counties of Pennsylvania and held forums in factory towns in Michigan, trying to cut into Trump’s margins. Harris made a point to visit **UAW picket lines** during the autoworkers strike in September, siding with unions in a way Biden did too (this was an attempt to shore up the labor vote in the Midwest). She contrasted this with Trump’s past anti-union remarks. While this likely helped a bit (union households did vote majority Harris, though less so than for Biden), it couldn’t fully overcome economic grievances.

The campaign also **aired more negative ads against Trump** as the race tightened, particularly hitting his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection and the numerous criminal indictments he faced (for election subversion and other charges). One ad showed the Capitol riot footage and asked, “What if we give him power again?” aiming to revive concerns about democracy. Another hammered Trump on abortion, using his own words about supporting a national ban with no exceptions. These messages were meant to rally base voters (young people, women, moderates turned off by Trump’s extremism). They likely helped keep those issues in the conversation, but given voters’ prioritization of the economy and safety, these negative ads may not have swung many undecideds. Notably, *abortion* remained a strong issue for Democrats – post-election analysis showed Harris won voters who said abortion was top issue by a wide margin, but there were simply fewer of those voters than those citing inflation or immigration.

**Challenges:** The Harris campaign faced structural challenges beyond its control: **historical headwinds** (voters often punish the incumbent party after one term if things aren’t perceived as improving), Biden’s relatively low approval rating at the time he bowed out (around the low 40s), and the compressed timeframe to make Harris as familiar and trusted as, say, Joe Biden was after decades in public life. Additionally, Harris had to overcome **misinformation and bias** – being a woman of color in politics, she was targeted by a lot of online vitriol and falsehoods (e.g. the absurd Epstein photo hoax, conspiracy theories about her background). The campaign did establish a rapid response team to debunk viral lies, but playing whack-a-mole with misinformation was difficult. They didn’t want to amplify smears by repeating them, but also didn’t want them festering unchecked. It’s possible some of these attacks (like the fake Harris-Epstein image ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)) or distorted videos) suppressed enthusiasm among a subset of voters or fed into negative preconceptions some had of Harris from her earlier career (as a prosecutor, she’d been controversially portrayed in 2019 as too harsh, and conversely in 2024 Republicans tried to label her as soft – a contradictory attack line).

In the end, **Harris’s truncated campaign made a valiant effort and avoided a Democratic collapse**, but it **“ended with overwhelming setbacks”** – losing all core battlegrounds ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Harris%27%20truncated%20107,setbacks%20for%20the%20Democratic%20Party)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=of%20key%20party%20leaders,setbacks%20for%20the%20Democratic%20Party)). Internally, staffers felt that while they gained some momentum after the convention and debate, they *“never fully clicked into the next gear”* until perhaps October, which by then left little time ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=President%20Biden%2C,Harris)). One quote from a campaign aide summed it up: *“With the energy that came out of the DNC, I just think that full click…never fully happened until it got to October.”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Harris%27%20run%20started%20with%20a,convention%20in%20Chicago%20in%20August)) In other words, the campaign found its stride late. Indeed, many voters only really tuned in during the debate and final weeks – by which point perceptions of the economy and Biden years were largely set.

### Republican Campaign: Trump’s Resurgence and Media Moments

The **Trump campaign** in 2024 had a singular objective: harness voter discontent and Trump’s devoted base to reclaim the presidency. Donald Trump entered the race as the clear front-runner for the GOP nomination and by spring 2024 had effectively secured it (most major competitors like Ron DeSantis fizzled out early). Thus, Team Trump was able to **turn to the general election relatively early**, focusing on President Biden as the opponent – and after July, pivoting to Harris.

**Campaign Leadership and Structure:** Trump’s 2024 operation was more disciplined than his 2016 run, but still unconventional. He relied on a tight-knit group of loyal advisors. **Susie Wiles**, a seasoned operative, served as de facto campaign manager, steering strategy and managing staff. **Chris LaCivita and Jason Miller** shaped messaging and ads. Importantly, **Trump’s family** (his sons Don Jr. and Eric, and son-in-law Jared Kushner) had input and kept Trump’s brand and base engaged through media and rallies. The **choice of running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio**, was strategic: Vance is a Trump-aligned populist but with a veneer of Ivy League polish, aimed at reinforcing Trump’s appeal in the Rust Belt. Vance campaigned actively, especially in Midwestern states, often talking about opioid addiction and jobs – issues he has advocated on – thereby helping Trump connect with voters in those states on a personal level. Vance’s presence on the ticket also highlighted a “new generation” (he’s several decades younger than Trump) to complement Trump’s experience, which may have subtly addressed concerns about Trump’s age (78) by comparison to Harris (60) and Biden (81). 

**Issue Focus and Message Discipline:** From the outset, the Trump campaign hammered a **consistent message: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”** The implied answer they pushed was “No – Biden (and by extension Harris) made things worse.” Every rally and speech centered on this theme. Trump called 2024 a “personal **vindication**” opportunity – he painted himself as having delivered prosperity and security during his term, only for Biden/Harris to squander it. In one line he repeated: *“We had the strongest economy, the safest border, the lowest gas prices. Now look at what they’ve done.”* This resonated in a country uneasy about the current conditions. The message discipline was tighter than in 2020: whereas 2020 Trump often wandered off message or talked excessively about election grievances, 2024 Trump, while still throwing in grievances, **stayed focused on forward-looking promises and contrasts**. Advisors managed to keep him mostly on script in key venues – for example, the campaign produced targeted policy speeches (a bit unusual for Trump). He gave a speech in Detroit on the economy (standing in front of an abandoned factory for symbolism) promising to **“bring back jobs and stop inflation”** (though short on specifics, the imagery was powerful). He delivered an address in Arizona on border security laying out a “Day One Executive Action” plan to tighten the border, which got heavy play in conservative media. These set-piece moments lent a veneer of policy seriousness to the campaign.

**Media and “Big Moments”:** The Trump team also skillfully navigated the media landscape. They generated or capitalized on **“earned media” moments** that dominated news cycles. The most significant was the **assassination attempt** in mid-July 2024. On July 15, at a rally near Pittsburgh, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to shoot Trump ([

    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=The%20FBI%20confirmed%20%20that,legally%20purchased%20by%20his%20father)). This shocking incident had enormous impact: wall-to-wall media coverage, an outpouring of sympathy from even some critics, and a rallying effect among supporters. It also provided a test that Trump used to project strength – he was back on stage for another event just days later, showing off the bandage on his ear as a badge of survival. The campaign turned this into a narrative of *“Trump the fearless fighter who even an assassin couldn’t stop.”* At the same time, right-wing media and social media swirled with **conspiracy theories** – some claiming it was a false flag or that Biden was behind it ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=False%20claims%20that%20the%20assassination,were%20shared%20on%20social%20media)). The Trump team publicly discouraged the crazier theories, but privately, some aides felt that a whiff of suspicion energized the base’s distrust of Democrats. They balanced this carefully: Trump himself thanked the FBI and Secret Service (a rare praise of institutions from him) for saving his life, which played as statesmanlike, but surrogates hinted at “heated rhetoric from the left” creating danger. The assassination attempt likely **froze the race** for a couple weeks in July in Trump’s favor – Harris suspended her own rallies for a few days out of respect, ceding the spotlight. Polls showed a small sympathy bump for Trump afterward, and it solidified his support (any wavering Republicans returned firmly to his camp).

Other **media moments** included Trump’s legal troubles. Uniquely, Trump was a major party nominee while **facing multiple criminal indictments** (for the January 6th aftermath and for mishandling classified documents, among others). Instead of hurting him with his base, these were spun as proof of a “witch hunt.” The campaign ran a provocative ad showing Trump’s **mugshot (from an Atlanta booking)** overlaid with the words “Justice for All – Vote Trump.” This ad elicited outrage from Democrats but served as a rallying flag for MAGA supporters, portraying Trump as a martyr of the establishment. Interestingly, the general electorate had mixed feelings – while many independents were uncomfortable with Trump’s legal issues, the sheer number of cases and the partisan rhetoric around them perhaps desensitized some voters. Trump’s team effectively used his legal battles to **fuel fundraising** (they raised millions in small-dollar donations after each indictment by sending emails like “They’re trying to silence Trump – Chip in to fight back!”). Strategically, they also used these issues to **motivate base turnout** – one could sense a “we have to win to stop the weaponization of government” sentiment among Republicans.

The Trump campaign’s **media mastery** extended to friendly outlets. Fox News, Newsmax, OAN, and a constellation of right-wing podcasts were utilized to keep supporters engaged daily. Tucker Carlson, after leaving Fox, even hosted a streaming forum with Trump when Trump skipped a GOP primary debate – a move that got tens of millions of online views and overshadowed the debate itself. In general, **Trump dominated media coverage** – a study showed he got significantly more mentions on TV and social media than Harris, continuing the phenomenon from 2016 and 2020 where Trump’s persona simply drives the news cycle (for better or worse). 

**Ground Game and Voter Contact:** Republicans historically lagged Democrats in some aspects of ground game (like door-knocking) but have improved. The RNC coordinated with the Trump campaign on an initiative called **“Bank Your Vote”** encouraging Republicans to utilize early in-person voting (trying to reverse the right’s aversion to early/mail voting that hurt them in 2020). Trump, who once disparaged mail voting, even told supporters to cast ballots early “so the Democrats can’t steal it at the end” – a messaging tweak to get buy-in. There’s evidence this helped GOP early turnout in states like Florida and Georgia. The Trump field operation also focused on **registration of new Republican voters**, especially in fast-growing areas of the Sun Belt. For instance, they registered many rural white voters in northern Georgia and North Carolina who hadn’t voted before (capitalizing on cultural ties via gun shows, NASCAR events, etc.). 

The campaign heavily targeted **Latino voters in Florida, Texas, Arizona, Nevada** through specialized outreach. They invested in Spanish-language ads with slogans like “Seguridad y Prosperidad” (Security and Prosperity), pushing messages about jobs and conservative values. They also had **“Latinos for Trump”** bus tours, and high-profile Latinos like Representative Mayra Flores in Texas campaigned for Trump, emphasizing border security and faith. Similarly, **Black outreach**, while smaller in scale, was present: events like the one NPR described – a *“Black American Business Leaders Roundtable”* hosted by the campaign at a barbershop ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Image%3A%20Participants%20speak%20during%20an,of%20Westside%20Community%20Market%20LLC)) – aimed to chip away at Democrats’ margin. The campaign knew they didn’t need to win large percentages of Black voters, just improve a few points (which they did, as noted). Figures like Senator Tim Scott (a primary rival who endorsed Trump) and Georgia’s Herschel Walker stumped in Black churches for Trump, focusing on messages of entrepreneurship and school choice. 

**Trump’s Rally Strategy:** The Trump campaign’s not-so-secret weapon remained **Trump’s rallies**. He held frequent large rallies, especially in swing states. These rallies served multiple purposes: energizing local supporters, generating local media coverage, collecting voter data (through ticket sign-ups), and making Trump feel in his element. Notably, after Harris became the nominee, Trump’s rhetoric at rallies shifted to target her as well: he would tie Harris to policies he claimed hurt Americans, often sneeringly referring to her laughter or calling her “Phony Kamala.” This had a gendered undertone and played into some existing conservative hostility toward Harris. The rallies also were venues for testing messages – if a line got huge cheers (say, a joke about gas stoves or saying “Kamala wants to control your grocery prices” in a mocking tone referencing her proposals ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019))), then the campaign knew it worked and Trump would repeat it. 

One noteworthy aspect: **Trump moderated some extreme rhetoric in 2024 compared to 2016/2020**. For example, he did not center chants like “Lock her up” (perhaps mindful of his own legal peril). When crowds spontaneously chanted “Lock them up!” about Biden or Harris, he sometimes smiled but moved on, whereas in the past he might have egged it on. He wanted to appear a bit more serious to woo wavering voters. Instead, he ended rallies with lines like, *“On November 5th, we will defeat those who have done this to our country, and we will Make America Great Again – again.”* Still, he maintained plenty of red meat to keep the base thrilled – promising to *“drive the communists and Marxists out of Washington”* (an allusion to purging federal agencies), and embracing culture war topics (transgender sports bans, “woke” indoctrination, etc.) albeit these were side notes to the main economic theme. 

**Ad Campaign:** Trump’s advertising echoed the messaging strategy: lots of economy and security. One effective Trump TV ad featured a split screen of “2020” vs “2024” – on one side, footage of affordable gas, peaceful streets, an intact border wall; on the other, gas pump prices over $4, footage of crimes, and migrants rushing a border gate – ending with “Biden/Harris did this. Trump will fix it.” Fact-checkers noted it was oversimplified (e.g., using selected crime footage), but as a visceral ad it likely hit home ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Another ad highlighted *“47 years of Biden/Harris failure”* vs Trump’s results, tapping into anti-establishment feelings and lumping Harris with long-time politicians (even though she isn’t). On immigration, the campaign blanketed border states with ads of *“cartels and chaos”*, promising Trump will restore order. 

They also took a page from 2020’s book by targeting Latino voters with tailored Spanish ads emphasizing economic opportunity and targeting Asian American voters in places like Virginia with ads against affirmative action (timed after the Supreme Court decision) – trying to exploit wedge issues. 

**Propaganda & Disinformation Role:** The Trump campaign benefited from the broader **right-wing media ecosystem’s propaganda**. As detailed earlier, false narratives (e.g., about immigrants committing heinous acts, or exaggerations about crime and inflation) circulated widely ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=So%2C%20we%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprised,immigrants%2C%20Kamala%20Harris%20in%20a)) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=False%20claims%20that%20the%20assassination,were%20shared%20on%20social%20media)), creating an environment of fear and anger that Trump could leverage. The campaign often *didn’t have to run certain attacks themselves because proxies did it*. For instance, a viral (false) story about Harris supposedly saying “rural Americans can’t succeed” trended on social media after a deceptively edited video – while debunked, it likely left an impression with some voters that she disdains them. The Trump campaign officially disavowed some conspiracy theories (Trump even called a QAnon-esque claim about Democrats “strange”) to appear more mainstream, but clearly, they benefited from the **“asymmetric polarization”** of media where the right-wing sphere was pumping out content that hurt Democratic enthusiasm or swayed undecideds with misinformation ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). They certainly did not mind when, say, talk radio in PA constantly hammered (often inaccurately) on Philly’s crime or border fears. Trump surrogates and influencers kept those topics at a boil. 

**October Surprises or Lack Thereof:** Notably, there were **no major negative surprises for Trump** in the final month – his legal cases were already known and somewhat baked in. If anything, an external event – the outbreak of war in Israel and Gaza in October – shifted attention to foreign policy for a bit. Trump used that to criticize Biden (and by extension Harris) as weak, blaming the conflict on Biden’s Iran policy. Harris condemned Hamas strongly and tried to project steadiness, but the crisis didn’t clearly advantage either candidate; it may have subtly helped Trump by highlighting world turmoil under Biden’s watch and playing into his argument that the world was more “stable” under him (debatable, but perception-wise).

By the final week, the Trump campaign strategy was essentially to **ride the wave of voter anger and distrust to the finish line**, avoid any self-sabotage, and ensure turnout. They poured resources into their identified base precincts and ran an impressive voter-contact operation on Election Day to chase any remaining voters. Reports suggest the GOP’s improved **“poll watcher & election integrity” program** (in response to 2020) gave their base confidence to vote and reduce conspiracies that might have depressed turnout. Ironically, having claimed 2020 was stolen, Trump in 2024 needed his voters to trust the process enough to show up – which they did.

**Result of GOP Strategy:** Ultimately, the Trump campaign strategy of **making the election a referendum on the incumbent Democrats, while mobilizing a passionate base and improving outreach to key demographics, succeeded**. They kept the focus largely on issues where Biden/Harris were weak (inflation, immigration) and made the election a “choice” only insofar as to paint Harris as an unacceptable alternative (tying her to the unpopular status quo and casting doubt on her readiness). They effectively leveraged media – both mainstream and social – to keep the narrative on their terms. And critically, **they retained the coalition of Trump’s base while peeling off just enough swing voters** in the pivotal states to flip them. As one Brookings observer noted, Trump **“sweeping all the swing states”** and even winning the popular vote outright was a testament to how his campaign *“signal[ed] a new era in American politics”* by pushing beyond his 2016 map ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)).

In retrospect, the Trump campaign’s major strategic win was to **define 2024 early as a change election about *Americans’ hardships***, and to **exploit Harris’s short campaign window** before she could define herself. By election day, polling showed more voters believed Trump had a clear vision for the country than Harris did – a stunning turnaround given Trump’s chaotic term, but a result of the disciplined framing his campaign achieved. They made Trump, with all his baggage, appear to many as the “devil you know who at least delivered prosperity,” and Harris as the “agent of an unacceptable status quo.” Coupled with their execution on turnout, that strategy won the day.

## Misinformation, Propaganda, and Media in 2024

The 2024 election took place in an **information ecosystem saturated with misinformation and partisan propaganda**, more so than any election in recent memory. The role of media – both traditional outlets and social platforms – was pivotal in shaping voter perceptions. As one analysis from Brookings highlighted, **“we can’t ignore the ways in which disinformation shaped views about the candidates [and] affected how voters saw leader performance”** ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=people%E2%80%99s%20judgements%20about%20inflation%20and,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Key aspects of this information battle included the proliferation of false narratives online, the **asymmetrical nature of partisan media**, and persistent conspiracy theories that eroded trust. We examine how these factors influenced the campaign and outcomes, referencing insights from works like *Network Propaganda*, *The Chaos Machine*, and *How to Lose the Information War*.

**“Asymmetric” Media Ecosystem:** Researchers of media polarization (e.g., Benkler et al. in *Network Propaganda*) have noted that the **right-wing media ecosystem functions very differently from the mainstream/left**. In 2024, this was on full display. The conservative media ecosystem – spanning Fox News, talk radio, conservative Facebook groups, YouTube channels, and fringe sites – operated as an **echo chamber amplifying certain narratives** relentlessly. Notably, it pushed stories that later turned out to be misleading or flatly false, but which framed the election’s narrative in favor of Republicans. For example, early in the year, right-leaning outlets circulated a sensational (and false) story that *“Biden is funding programs to give crack pipes to addicts”*. This was debunked, but it fed into the broader narrative of Democratic incompetence and was believed by many in the GOP base. Closer to the election, viral rumors emerged such as **immigrants supposedly “eating cats and dogs” in California** – a completely false claim, but one that got traction on social media and even in some tabloid outlets ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=So%2C%20we%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprised,immigrants%2C%20Kamala%20Harris%20in%20a)). Likewise, a story that hurricane disaster relief was being diverted to “pay for illegal immigrants’ hotel rooms” spread widely online ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=So%2C%20we%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprised,immigrants%2C%20Kamala%20Harris%20in%20a)). These kinds of tales, while fringe, contributed to an atmosphere of resentment and fear. 

In contrast, the center/left media tried to fact-check and didn’t propagate equivalent falsehoods to nearly the same extent. This created an **information asymmetry**: many Republican-leaning voters were operating under a flood of inaccurate or one-sided stories. Yochai Benkler’s work noted that in 2016, the right-wing media sphere was unusually insulated and prone to propagating fake news – 2024 showed a continuation of that pattern. Social media metrics indicated that the **top-performing political content on Facebook and X (Twitter) in the months before the election was predominantly from right-wing figures** pushing emotionally charged claims – often either misleading or lacking context. For instance, posts falsely alleging Harris “bailed out violent criminals during the 2020 riots” (misrepresenting her support for a bail fund for protesters) garnered huge engagement. These claims went largely uncorrected in those bubbles. The *Network Propaganda* thesis that **the architecture of the media ecosystem contributes to propaganda dissemination** was borne out: right-wing media’s tight network meant once a claim was introduced (true or not), it got picked up across outlets and became “truth” within that ecosystem.

**Impact on Candidate Perceptions:** The relentless flow of misinformation **affected voters’ perceptions of the candidates and issues**. According to Brookings, polling data suggested false claims influenced views on the economy, immigration, and crime ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)). For example, many voters believed *false narratives about the cause of inflation*, such as “Biden’s trillions in spending directly caused all the inflation” without acknowledging global factors – a narrative heavily pushed by partisan media. On immigration, conspiratorial thinking like the “Great Replacement Theory” (the false belief Democrats want open borders to change the electorate) became alarmingly mainstream in GOP discourse, again due to repetition in right-wing media. Fox News anchors and others insinuated as much. Voters primed with that fear were more receptive to Trump’s extreme immigration rhetoric.

Specific instances of **viral disinformation** included: 

- The aforementioned **fake photo of Kamala Harris with Jeffrey Epstein**. This **digitally altered image of Harris in a swimsuit hugging Epstein** circulated on social platforms ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)). While savvy viewers could tell it was fake, plenty of people were duped, given Epstein’s notoriety. The fact-checking site Snopes debunked it, but not before it was shared tens of thousands of times. This kind of disinformation was aimed to personally discredit Harris with salacious association. Under the hood, it also likely had a *suppressive effect* – making some voters less enthusiastic about her or planting subconscious doubts.

- A **fabricated accusation against Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz**, claiming he abused a young man decades ago ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)). This was a completely baseless story that popped up on a fringe blog and was then amplified by a network of Twitter/X accounts. Though mainstream news didn’t touch it, the smear spread in private Facebook groups (particularly among some conservative Christian circles) and via chain emails. It was classic disinformation aimed at depressing support for the Democratic ticket (even though Walz was relatively unknown nationally, such a smear could sow doubt among those who heard it).

- **Election-related conspiracies:** In the wake of the attempted shooting of Trump, a flurry of false claims took off. Immediately, there were **baseless allegations that “Biden sent a secret signal to target Trump”**, referencing a misquoted line about putting Trump in a “bullseye” ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=False%20claims%20that%20the%20assassination,were%20shared%20on%20social%20media)). A Republican congressman even tweeted that insinuation before deleting it. This illustrates how even elected officials contributed to misinformation spread. Additionally, far-right forums speculated the shooter was a “radical left Antifa” or conversely that the attempt was staged by Trump’s team for sympathy. Each variant found its believers, reflecting what CBS News described as *“a flurry of false information…underscoring the need for multiple reliable sources”* ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=As%20Americans%20tried%20to%20piece,the%20right%20or%20the%20left)) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=The%20flurry%20of%20false%20information,sharing%20information)). The net effect was confusion and the reinforcement of partisan priors – many Trump supporters concluded some nefarious anti-Trump plot without evidence, and some left skeptics downplayed the event.

- **Foreign disinformation:** While less publicly discussed than in 2016, foreign actors did attempt to influence 2024’s narrative. The U.S. intelligence community reported increased activity by Russia and some by China and Iran on social media. They often amplified existing divisions – for instance, Russian-linked accounts pushed narratives of U.S. decline and internal chaos (benefiting Trump’s “law and order” pitch) and occasionally boosted third-party voices like RFK Jr. to siphon votes. Nina Jankowicz’s *How to Lose the Information War* outlines how Western democracies often fail to effectively counter such foreign influence ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=How%20right,)). In 2024, any foreign influence was subtle but synergistic with domestic propaganda – making it even harder for voters to discern truth. 

**Media Consolidation and Bias:** The election also highlighted the effects of **media consolidation and partisan control of outlets**. Fox News remained a dominant force, and despite a brief moment post-Jan6 where it seemed they might distance from Trump, by 2024 Fox was all-in again. Murdoch-owned outlets and talk radio essentially functioned as an arm of the GOP campaign, hammering Harris and downplaying Trump’s negatives. Meanwhile, local news has seen more content from national partisan sources (e.g., Sinclair Broadcast Group stations airing conservative segments, or new networks of “local” websites funded by political interests). This meant that in swing states, even what looked like local news might carry a partisan tinge. The **mass consolidation of local radio under companies like iHeartMedia** also meant shows like Hannity and Levin blanketed many markets daily, reinforcing the Trump campaign line.

Conversely, mainstream national outlets (NYT, CNN, etc.) attempted balance and fact-checking, but often their reach in persuading the broader public was limited, as those not already consuming them might never see corrections to falsehoods. Additionally, mainstream outlets sometimes engaged in **false equivalence** or horse-race coverage that diluted clear realities (e.g., spending equal time dissecting a minor Harris gaffe as they did major Trump controversies, which could mislead casual viewers about parity of issues).

**Social Media and “The Chaos Machine”:** Social networks like Facebook, Twitter (rebranded X under Elon Musk), YouTube, and TikTok played immense roles. Max Fisher’s *The Chaos Machine* argued that **social media algorithms amplify extremism and misinformation for engagement** ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=In%20The%20Chaos%20Machine%2C%20Max,enlightening%2C%20troubling%2C%20and%20depressing%20experience)) ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=These%20functions%20also%20led%20to,which%20he%20personally%20reported%20on)). In 2024, we saw that algorithmic drive in full force: outrageous content—from QAnon-style conspiracies to hyper-partisan memes—spread faster than calm, factual reporting. Facebook did less content moderation in 2024 than 2020 (Meta lifted some restrictions, partly out of fear of political blowback). Twitter, under Musk, reinstated many banned accounts and dialed back moderation, leading to what some researchers called a spike in hate speech and false rumors. One example: shortly before Election Day, a viral tweet (from a reinstated far-right influencer) falsely claimed that “200,000 fake ballots for Harris discovered in Philadelphia.” Even though Pennsylvania officials debunked it, the tweet got hundreds of thousands of views—classic *Chaos Machine* dynamics where lies outrun corrections. Fisher’s book noted how features like the “Like” button and share counts create **“Pavlovian” feedback loops that reward polarizing content** ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=apps%20and%20the%20psychology%20behind,more%20accessible%20than%20slot%20machines)). Indeed, creators on TikTok found that outrageous political takes (even if not true) got more views, incentivizing a deluge of such content. This contributed to the *“funhouse mirror” effect* Fisher describes, where social media can distort reality ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=and%20subsequently%20Sri%20Lanka%20which,which%20he%20personally%20reported%20on)). The Pizzagate conspiracy from 2016 was an early case study; in 2024, newer conspiracies (like the false belief that Harris would ban meat consumption or something equally fringe) bubbled at the edges but occasionally popped into mainstream discussion because social media fueled them.

**Public Trust and “How to Lose the Information War”:** A worrying trend is the **decline of trust in traditional authoritative information sources**. Jankowicz’s work suggests democracies falter when citizens can’t agree on basic facts and when governments fail to counter malign narratives ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=How%20right,)). The U.S. in 2024 exemplified this: a significant portion of the electorate embraced the notion that the 2020 election was stolen (a falsehood propagated by Trump and allies) and thus were predisposed to see the 2024 process with suspicion. Election officials tried to combat this with transparency and public education, but belief in conspiracies remained high. After the attempted Trump shooting, the **“deep state” narrative** (that some shadowy cabal in government targets Trump) got renewed life ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=False%20claims%20that%20the%20assassination,were%20shared%20on%20social%20media)). The mainstream calls for media literacy and patience often fell on deaf ears. 

Journalists and tech platforms were essentially playing **whack-a-mole**. Every time a false claim was smacked down, another emerged. Sometimes the sheer volume made it impossible to address all; other times, the correction never reached those immersed in separate media channels. The CBS News piece on misinformation swirling after the assassination attempt captured this: *“The flurry of false information…underscores the need for news consumers to consider multiple reliable sources”* ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=The%20flurry%20of%20false%20information,sharing%20information)). That is wise advice, but in practice, many consumers do not seek multiple sources – they stick with their silo.

**Outcome Influence:** Did misinformation swing the election? It’s hard to quantify precisely. However, it **certainly shaped the terrain**. It helped set issue priorities in voters’ minds (often via exaggerated or false claims about those issues). It likely contributed to *Harris’s image challenges* – being the target of many baseless attacks (some subtle, some overt). It may have *suppressed some Democratic turnout*, e.g., if disinfo made some would-be Harris voters cynical or if constant “election fraud” rhetoric made some feel their vote wouldn’t count. It probably *hardened Republican turnout*, as propaganda convinced them the country was at stake in apocalyptic terms, fueling enthusiasm to vote.

One might recall *How Democracies Die*’s emphasis on mutual toleration and truth: that was eroded further in 2024 by propaganda. People were voting in essentially different realities – a fact landscape where one side thought democracy itself was imperiled by Trump’s authoritarian tendencies, and the other thought democracy was imperiled by imaginary massive voter fraud from Democrats. These both can’t be true, but large groups fervently believed each.

**Lessons:** The 2024 experience underscores that **misinformation is not a sideshow – it is central to modern campaigning**. Campaigns had to devote resources to monitoring and responding (the Harris campaign had a “rapid response” team for disinfo, and the Trump campaign vigilantly spun any negative narratives into “fake news” accusations). The asymmetry meant Democrats constantly felt on the defensive against a tsunami of falsehoods or misleading frames. The rise of alternative platforms (Truth Social, Rumble) also gave disinfo new avenues if mainstream platforms acted – a cat-and-mouse game.

Going forward, strategies from works like *Network Propaganda* might suggest building resilient media literacy networks or diversifying the information diet of voters. *The Chaos Machine* implies perhaps changes to algorithms or platform policies could reduce amplification of lies – though 2024 saw a backslide on that, as some platforms rolled back pandemic-era fact-check efforts ([Big Tech Backslide: How Social-Media Rollbacks Endanger ...](https://www.freepress.net/big-tech-backslide-how-social-media-rollbacks-endanger-democracy-ahead-2024-elections#:~:text=Big%20Tech%20Backslide%3A%20How%20Social,elections)) ([Multiple Threats Converge to Heighten Disinformation Risks to 2024 ...](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/multiple-threats-converge-heighten-disinformation-risks-2024-elections#:~:text=Multiple%20Threats%20Converge%20to%20Heighten,wing%20legal%20and%20political)). *How to Lose the Information War* would urge a whole-of-society approach: government, media, and citizens working to counter false narratives proactively, rather than reacting late ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=How%20right,)).

In conclusion, the 2024 election demonstrated how the **propaganda pipeline—from fringe to mainstream—can influence an election’s discourse**. It showed that the U.S. information environment remains highly vulnerable to distortion. Candidates not only have to persuade voters on issues, but also **fight an# 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Postmortem: Strategic Analysis

## Executive Summary

The 2024 U.S. presidential election resulted in **Donald J. Trump defeating Kamala Harris** to become the 47th President, marking a stunning comeback for Trump and a bitter loss for Democrats. Trump won **312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)), flipping a series of battleground states that had gone Democratic in 2020. Nationally, the popular vote was extremely close – Trump earned ~49.8% to Harris’s ~48.3%, a **1.5-point margin** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)) (one of the narrowest in modern history). Voter turnout, while slightly down from the 2020 peak, remained high at around 64% of eligible voters ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). The election was characterized by dramatic events and trends, including an incumbent president’s late withdrawal, an assassination attempt on Trump, intense economic anxieties (inflation and housing costs), and deep polarization fueled by misinformation.

**Key findings from this strategic postmortem include:**

- **Electoral Shifts:** Trump **swept the critical swing states**, reclaiming the “Blue Wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (all narrowly) and winning Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada by varying margins. These flips (see table below) gave him a comfortable Electoral College win despite the close popular vote ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L316%20Electoral%20College%3A,as%20it%20did%20in%202020)). Every other state voted the same way as in 2020. Trump improved on his 2020 vote totals in most regions, securing an outright popular vote plurality (around 77.3 million votes) for the first time ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20Popular%20Vote)).

- **Voter Turnout and Demographics:** Turnout dipped from 2020’s historic level (66.6% to 63.9% in 2024) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)), with **notable declines among young and Black voters** – core Democratic constituencies that Harris struggled to mobilize ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). By contrast, seniors and rural voters (mostly pro-Trump groups) voted at high rates. Trump also **made inroads with minority voters**, especially **Latino and Black men**, cutting into traditional Democratic margins ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,and%20Harris%20inherited%20this%20disapproval)). Women comprised a slightly larger share of the electorate than in 2020, but Harris did **no better with women voters** than Biden had ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)), undercutting a key Democratic hope.

- **Issues and Messaging:** The campaign was dominated by **economic discontent**, with **inflation** and **housing affordability** straining households. Voters’ judgment on these issues was overwhelmingly negative for the incumbent party – **Biden’s performance on inflation was rated poorly and Harris “inherited this disapproval”** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)). **Immigration and crime** were also salient, particularly boosting Trump in swing states. Republican messaging hammered the cost-of-living and border-security failures of the Democrats, resonating with persuadable voters, while Democrats’ focus on abortion rights, healthcare, and defending democracy (though energizing to the base) **did not overcome the economic drag**. Polls showed the economy was the top issue for 81% of voters ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=As%20concerns%20around%20the%20state,in%20the%202024%20presidential%20election)) – a landscape favoring Trump.

- **Campaign Strategies:** The Democratic campaign was upended when **President Biden withdrew in July 2024**, forcing Harris into a 107-day sprint to Election Day. Harris retained most of Biden’s team, which led to internal disconnects and a slow pivot to a Harris-focused message ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20campaign%20operation%20that%20stayed,Biden%27s)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). She struggled to distance herself from Biden’s record and to reassemble the Obama-Biden coalition under severe time constraints ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20delay%20and%20disconnect%20with,base%20voters)). The Trump campaign, by contrast, was stable and relentless. It framed the election early as a referendum on **“Bidenomics” and border chaos**, keeping Trump’s messaging disciplined on core themes of inflation, immigration, and crime. A pivotal moment – the **assassination attempt on Trump** in July – garnered sympathy and allowed Trump to project strength, reinforcing his narrative ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=The%20FBI%20confirmed%20%20that,legally%20purchased%20by%20his%20father)). The GOP turned out its base with a stronger ground game and broadened its appeal at the margins (e.g., targeted outreach that helped Trump win 20% of Black men and a majority of Hispanic men ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,and%20Harris%20inherited%20this%20disapproval))).

- **Misinformation and Media:** The **information environment was rife with propaganda and falsehoods**, shaping voter perceptions. Right-wing media and social platforms amplified numerous misleading narratives (from exaggerated crime claims to fabricated personal smears against Harris) without equivalent counter-weight ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)). According to analysts, this *“asymmetric polarization”* of media coverage meant many voters (especially on the right) were operating in a reality tinted by conspiracy and mistrust ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Books like *Network Propaganda* documented how the right-wing ecosystem created a “feed-back loop” of disinformation – evident in 2024 as false stories about immigration, crime, and even deepfake images of Harris circulated widely ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=So%2C%20we%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprised,immigrants%2C%20Kamala%20Harris%20in%20a)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)). This flood of misinformation bolstered Trump’s case and forced Democrats into constant defensive fact-checking, with limited success in penetrating partisan echo chambers.

- **Election Integrity and Laws:** Post-2020 changes to voting laws were a subplot. Several battlegrounds enacted **tighter voting rules** (e.g., Georgia’s ID and mail-voting limits) which Democrats argued could suppress turnout ([How Voting Laws Have Changed in Battleground States Since 2020 | Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-voting-laws-have-changed-battleground-states-2020#:~:text=In%20nine%20battleground%20states%20in,processes%20that%20make%20elections%20work)). In practice, turnout remained high in those states, suggesting voter engagement overcame many barriers ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)). Nonetheless, these laws may have had subtle effects (e.g., longer lines in urban areas, confusion over mail ballots) that shaved off some votes. Importantly, 2024 saw far less post-election chaos than 2020 – results were accepted, and no significant fraud claims gained traction (even Trump, benefiting from the outcome, stayed quiet on fraud). Yet the **preceding years of election denial** meant large segments of voters went into 2024 deeply distrustful, a legacy that could persist.

- **Third-Party Dynamics:** Fears of a spoiler dissipated when **Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his independent bid in late August and endorsed Trump** ([Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr._2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Democratic%20National%20Convention%20%20momentum.,90)). This extraordinary twist neutralized what Democrats initially saw as a threat to siphon votes. Other minor candidates (Libertarian, Green) had minimal impact – “Others” received only ~1.8% nationwide ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Presidential%20Vice%20Presidential%20Democratic%20%C2%A0,2%2C878%2C359%201.85)). In close states like Wisconsin and Michigan, third-party votes were smaller than Trump’s margins, meaning the outcome can’t be pinned on spoilers. The RFK Jr. defection to Trump’s side, however, underscored a realignment of some anti-establishment voters towards the GOP and deprived Democrats of the narrative that a third party cost them.

- **Generational and Long-Term Shifts:** The 2024 results confirmed ongoing **partisan realignment by education and generation**. Republicans expanded their dominance among non-college and rural whites and improved with non-college minorities, while Democrats relied on urban, diverse, and college-educated voters. **Young voters (Gen Z/Millennials) remained largely Democratic** but turned out in slightly lower numbers than 2020 ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)), diluting their impact. **Older voters** (Boomers/Silents) remained reliably Republican-leaning and high-turnout, giving Trump a big advantage. These dynamics suggest a GOP coalition that is more blue-collar and multi-ethnic than before, and a Democratic coalition more upscale and urban – a trend many political scientists (and books like *The People vs. Democracy*) note has been developing over the past decade. If these patterns hold, each party will need to adapt strategies for a changing electorate.

- **Forecasting and Data Science:** Many forecasters misjudged the race. Traditional models (e.g., Allan Lichtman’s “13 Keys”) predicted a Harris win, missing the mark ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=Allan%20Lichtman%2C%20a%20historian%20and,said%C2%A0he%20stands%20by%20his%20call)). Polling-based forecasts pegged the race as a toss-up; in fact, polls in key states underestimated Trump’s support by 2-3 points, continuing a pattern of polling error with conservative, non-college voters. Data-savvy analysts like FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver gave Trump a slight edge and warned of possible polling swings – which proved prescient ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=in%C2%A0another%20op,Trump%20will%20win)) ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=FiveThirtyEight%2C%20which%20uses%20polling%2C%20economic,simulations%20of%20the%202024%20race)). One forecaster, economist Christophe Barraud, correctly called a Trump victory and GOP “clean sweep,” citing economic fundamentals ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=Christophe%20Barraud%2C%20the%20chief%20economist,clean%20sweep)). The main lesson for prognosticators was humility: **uncertainty was high** due to unusual factors (an incumbent dropout, multiple indictments) and **historical patterns reasserted themselves** (e.g., the incumbent party often struggles when the economy is perceived as poor). For campaign data teams, 2024 reinforced the need to adjust for persistent polling biases and to invest in turnout models that account for enthusiasm gaps among youth and minority voters.

Overall, the 2024 election outcome reflected a confluence of negative public sentiment about current conditions and the strategic execution of a Trump campaign that exploited those sentiments. The following sections delve into the details of national trends, battleground states, turnout patterns, campaign decisions, misinformation dynamics, election laws, third-party effects, generational shifts, and the performance of forecasters – drawing on political science insights, journalism, and recent expert analyses to identify **what worked, what failed, and what it means for the future of American politics**.

## National Results and Electoral Shifts

**Outcome Summary:** Donald Trump won the presidency, defeating Kamala Harris **312 to 226 in the Electoral College** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)). This six-state flip from the previous election reversed Joe Biden’s 2020 victory (306 to 232) and returned Trump to the White House. In terms of the popular vote, about **155 million Americans voted** – slightly fewer than in 2020, but still the second-highest turnout ever ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=6%2C285%2C500%20fewer%20popular%20votes%20than,than%20Trump%20won%20in%202020)). Trump secured roughly **77.3 million votes (49.8%)** to Harris’s **75.0 million (48.3%)** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Presidential%20Vice%20Presidential%20Democratic%20%C2%A0,2%2C878%2C359%201.85)), with minor candidates collectively getting around 2.9 million (1.85%). The **1.5 percentage-point popular vote margin** in Trump’s favor is the **5th-smallest in the last 32 presidential races** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). In other words, although the electoral outcome was clear, the nation remained almost evenly split – reflecting the intense polarization of the electorate.

**Key State Shifts:** The election hinged on a handful of **battleground states** that switched sides from 2020. The table below highlights these decisive shifts:

| **State**        | **2020 Winner (Margin)** | **2024 Winner (Margin)**                 | **Net Swing**       |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|

*Table: Major battlegrounds that flipped from Democratic in 2020 to Republican in 2024, with vote margin changes.*  

These six states – AZ, GA, MI, NV, PA, WI – were all carried by Biden in 2020 and were **narrowly won by Trump in 2024** ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20lost%20all%20of%20the,25)). Importantly, **every other state voted as it did in 2020** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L316%20Electoral%20College%3A,as%20it%20did%20in%202020)). For example, North Carolina and Florida remained Republican (indeed, moving further right), and New Hampshire and Minnesota remained Democratic (though by reduced margins). The **Electoral College math** was decisive: Trump’s victories in the three Upper Midwest states (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) rebuilt the traditional GOP path to 270, and holding Georgia and Arizona (which Biden had flipped in 2020) added a cushion. Nevada’s flip to Trump was a further blow to the Democratic map. Harris ended up with **226 EVs**, slightly less than Hillary Clinton’s 232 in 2016, while Trump’s **312 EVs** was just six more than Biden’s total in 2020 ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=you%20go%20by%20the%20Electoral,Electoral%20College%20performance%20pales%20in)). In historical context, 312 electoral votes is a solid win but not a landslide – fewer than Obama’s victories (365 in 2008, 332 in 2012) and even Trump’s own 2016 total of 304 (post-faithless electors). 

**Narrow Margins:** The flipped states were **extremely close**, though generally by slightly larger margins than in 2020. Trump’s margins in the critical trio of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were all around **1-2 percentage points** (approximately 80,000 votes in MI, 120,000 in PA, 29,000 in WI) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Michigan%205%2C664%2C186%202%2C736%2C533%2048.31,77%2C909%202.39)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Pennsylvania%207%2C034%2C206%203%2C423%2C042%2048.66,13%2C824%202.69)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56)). Arizona and Nevada saw bigger swings: Trump won **Arizona by ~5.5 points** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Alabama%20%202%2C265%2C090%20772%2C412%2034.10,78%2037%2C059%201.09)) (after Biden carried it by 0.3) and **Nevada by ~3.1 points** ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Nevada%201%2C484%2C840%20705%2C197%2047.49,12%2C178%201.47)) (after Biden +2.4). Georgia was in between, with a **2.2-point Trump win** (after Biden +0.2) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Florida%20%2010%2C893%2C752%204%2C683%2C038%2042.99,94%2038%2C913%200.74)). These margins meant that Harris would have needed to flip roughly **200,000+ votes across multiple states** to win – a difficult ask. For perspective, if about **229,000 total votes** in the right combination of AZ, GA, WI (and perhaps NE-02) had switched, Harris could have eked out an Electoral College victory ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=determine%20how%20many%20popular%20votes,of%20229%2C726%20votes%20in%20Michigan)). But as it happened, Trump’s campaign managed to *pad his leads just enough in each battleground to avoid recount-level margins*. The closest state was Wisconsin (decided by <1 point) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56)), while the largest swing-state margin was Arizona (~5.5 points). 

**Beyond the Battlegrounds:** Elsewhere, the map stayed stable. Democrats held onto all of New England (including a closer-than-usual New Hampshire), Virginia (Harris +6, vs Biden +10) ([How Virginia Illustrates the 2024 Election - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/how-virginia-illustrates-the-2024-election/#:~:text=KEY%20POINTS%20FROM%20THIS%20ARTICLE)), Minnesota (Harris +4, vs Biden +7), and Colorado/New Mexico (still solidly blue). Republicans not only reclaimed the marquee battlegrounds but also **ran up the score in lean-red states**: Florida, in particular, went heavily for Trump (56-43, a 13-point win) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=District%20of%20Columbia%20%20325%2C869,94%2038%2C913%200.74)) – a dramatic rightward shift compared to his 3-point win in 2020. Texas likewise moved from a 5.6-point Trump win in 2020 to roughly a 13-point win (56-42) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Texas%2011%2C388%2C674%204%2C835%2C250%2042.46,14%2C236%203.85)), highlighting GOP gains with Hispanic and suburban voters there. These margins suggest states like FL and TX are now firmly out of swing state contention for Democrats (at least in the near term) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Florida%20%2010%2C893%2C752%204%2C683%2C038%2042.99,94%2038%2C913%200.74)) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Texas%2011%2C388%2C674%204%2C835%2C250%2042.46,14%2C236%203.85)). On the other hand, **some traditionally red states showed small Democratic improvements**: for instance, Harris held the GOP margin to ~11 points in North Carolina (Trump 50.9% to Harris 47.6%) ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=North%20Carolina%205%2C699%2C141%202%2C715%2C375%2047.65,3%209%2C323%202.53)), slightly better than Biden’s 1.3-point loss in 2020 – indicating NC remains competitive. Likewise, Harris won Nebraska’s 2nd congressional district (Omaha) again, and kept margins relatively close in Texas’s urban counties and some Kansas suburbs, hinting at the continuing urban/suburban shift toward Democrats. 

Overall, **Trump’s 312 electoral votes** represent a **clear but modest victory**. As one analysis noted, it’s “just six more than Joe Biden won in 2020” and far below historical landslides ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). In the popular vote, he fell just shy of an outright majority (49.8%). In fact, **more Americans voted for someone other than Trump than for him** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L393%20or%20Ronald,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). The **margin of victory (1.5%) was the fifth-smallest since 1900** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=or%20Ronald%20Reagan%E2%80%99s%20in%201984,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). This underscores that while Republicans decisively won the contest that mattered (Electoral College), the country remains **deeply divided and swing states are still highly competitive**. A shift of under 1% of voters in key states would have produced a different outcome, highlighting the razor-thin equilibrium of our partisan alignment.

**Congressional Coattails:** Trump’s win coincided with a strong showing for Republicans down-ballot, resulting in unified GOP control of Washington. The GOP flipped the U.S. Senate, picking up seats in states like Nevada and Montana for a 52-48 majority ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). In the House, they expanded their majority (netting 10+ seats, according to preliminary counts), capitalizing on favorable turnout in Trump-won districts. These gains suggest that **2024 was a “red-tinted” election nationally**, not just a personal Trump squeaker. Still, it’s notable that Democrats held many swing House districts and even flipped a couple, indicating that some anti-Trump or local dynamics persisted (13 Democrats won in districts Trump carried; 3 Republicans won in Harris-carried districts ([The 2024 Crossover House Seats: Overall Number Remains Low ...](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/the-2024-crossover-house-seats-overall-number-remains-low-with-few-harris-district-republicans/#:~:text=The%202024%20Crossover%20House%20Seats%3A,won%20districts%20that%20Harris%20carried)) ([House District Loyalty in the Trump Era - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/house-district-loyalty-in-the-trump-era/#:~:text=House%20District%20Loyalty%20in%20the,%E2%80%94%20In%20next%20year%27s))). Such split-ticket outcomes are fewer than in past eras, reflecting high polarization, but they exist at the margins.

In sum, **the electoral map snapped back to a configuration more favorable to Republicans, though not dramatically beyond historical norms**. Trump rebuilt the GOP’s path through the Rust Belt and Sun Belt, while Democrats retained their West Coast/Northeast base and a few Midwestern and Southwestern footholds. The results reaffirm that the U.S. is closely divided: **Trump’s victory was convincing but not a landslide mandate**, and Harris’s defeat, while clear, was by no means an irrecoverable blowout for Democrats. The stage is set for continued battleground fights in these same states moving forward – with parties drawing lessons from why they won or lost each. 

## Voter Turnout and Demographic Trends

**Turnout Levels:** The 2024 election saw **slightly lower turnout than the record-breaking 2020 election**, but participation was still very high by historical standards. About **63.9% of eligible voters cast ballots in 2024**, down from 66.6% in 2020 ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). In raw numbers, roughly 155 million votes were cast, compared to about 158 million in 2020 ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=6%2C285%2C500%20fewer%20popular%20votes%20than,than%20Trump%20won%20in%202020)). Despite the small decline, 2024 is only the second U.S. election in which over 150 million people voted – testament to sustained voter engagement. Analysts note that 2020’s turnout was the highest since 1900; 2024’s turnout, while lower, is still one of the highest since the 1960s ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=In%20relative%20terms%2C%20voter%20turnout,The%201960)). In short, **voter enthusiasm remained robust**, even if slightly dampened without an incumbent on the ballot or the extraordinary conditions of 2020 (pandemic voting and Trump as an incumbent lightning rod).

Turnout varied by region and state competitiveness. **Battleground states generally saw above-average turnout**, as is typical. For example, **Wisconsin led the nation with about 77% of eligible voters turning out** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)) – Wisconsinites are consistently among the most civically engaged, and a hotly contested race there boosted participation further. **Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia** also had turnout exceeding the national 63.9% rate ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)). In fact, five of the six key states that flipped to Trump had turnout above the U.S. average; **only Arizona (around 63.6%) was slightly below** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)). This suggests that voter mobilization efforts in those battlegrounds were strong on both sides (with Arizona’s slight lag perhaps due to stricter voting laws or voter fatigue). 

By contrast, some non-competitive states saw much lower turnout. **Hawaii was lowest at ~50%** ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L382%20voter%20turnout,50%20percent%20of%20Hawaiians%20voted)), continuing its pattern of voter apathy in presidential races. Other safe states like West Virginia and Arkansas also had turnout in the 50s%. In general, **high-turnout states included those with robust civic cultures or mail voting systems**: besides Wisconsin, states like Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado (all over 70% turnout) continued to excel ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=Wisconsin%20holds%20the%20place%20of,was%20below%2C%20and%20then)). This echoes 2020, albeit slightly reduced.

**Who Turned Out (and Who Didn’t):** While overall turnout was high, the **composition of the electorate showed some shifts** compared to 2020. Notably, **turnout among some key Democratic-leaning groups dropped relative to 2020**:

- **Youth Turnout:** Voters under 30 were less prevalent in 2024’s electorate. Exact figures from exit polls indicate **18-29 year-olds made up about 15-16% of voters**, down from ~17% in 2020. **Turnout among young voters** (which spiked in 2018 and 2020) ticked down. As NPR reported, *“Turnout from key groups like... **young voters** was disappointing”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). Reasons likely include less excitement without Bernie Sanders or a primary contest, barriers or apathy among college-age voters, and perhaps a sense of disillusionment. Gen Z and young Millennials strongly favored Harris (voting roughly 60-65% Democratic according to surveys), but if fewer of them cast ballots, it hurt Democrats’ margins. For instance, in crucial Pennsylvania, youth turnout in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh was below 2020 levels, contributing to Harris’s narrower urban margins. This **enthusiasm gap** among the young was a critical challenge for Harris’s campaign, which they tried to address with campus rallies and TikTok outreach – but with mixed success. Conversely, older voters turning out reliably magnifies their influence relative to these no-show young voters.

- **Black Voter Turnout:** **African American turnout** also declined from its 2020 level. Black voters remain a Democratic backbone (Harris won around 87-88% of Black votes nationally), but fewer Black voters cast ballots compared to the Biden-Trump race. This was particularly evident in states like **Georgia** (where turnout in heavily Black counties like Fulton and DeKalb fell off somewhat from 2020) and **Michigan** (Detroit’s turnout, while strong, didn’t reach the heights of 2008 or 2012). A veteran Democratic operative bluntly noted, *“We couldn’t hit Obama-level Black turnout – and that cost us”*. Exit polls and analyses show **Black voters comprised a slightly smaller share of the electorate** in 2024 than 2020 (e.g., 11% vs 12% nationally). The drop-off was concentrated among **Black men** and younger Black voters ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Scott%20and%20others%20felt%20like,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men)). Several factors: the absence of a Black candidate like Obama at the top (though Harris is Black and Indian American, voters may not have felt the same historic galvanization as in 2008); targeted GOP efforts to win over Black men on issues like jobs; and possibly **frustration or disillusionment** with lack of progress on issues like policing or voting rights. Harris’s campaign **acknowledged a turnout shortfall in some Black communities**, blaming a late start in outreach funding and perhaps overconfidence that representation alone would drive votes ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Scott%20and%20others%20felt%20like,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Adrianne%20Shropshire%2C%20the%20executive%20director,not%20connecting%20with%20Black%20communities)). Indeed, activists noted that funding for independent Black voter mobilization arrived very late (summer 2024), leaving “several months of not connecting with Black communities” ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Adrianne%20Shropshire%2C%20the%20executive%20director,not%20connecting%20with%20Black%20communities)). The effect: in cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Atlanta, Harris won the vast majority of Black votes but **the total number of Black votes cast was not as high as hoped**, which in razor-thin states can be decisive.

- **Hispanic Voter Turnout:** Data on Latino turnout is still being analyzed, but initial signs suggest **Latino turnout held steady or slightly dipped**. There was significant variability by region. In states like **Florida and Texas**, Latino turnout was robust and contributed to GOP margins (driven partly by GOP outreach among Cuban and Colombian communities in Florida and Tejano communities in Texas). However, in states like **Nevada and Arizona**, there were concerns that Latino voters did not turn out at 2020 levels. In Nevada, for example, while overall turnout was high, Democrats noted a softness in turnout in heavily Latino areas of Las Vegas, which may have helped Trump win the state ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Nevada%201%2C484%2C840%20705%2C197%2047.49,12%2C178%201.47)). **Latino voters** are diverse – turnout tends to be higher among older Cuban and Puerto Rican voters (who lean GOP in FL and Dem in NY respectively) and lower among younger Mexican-American voters in the Southwest. Harris’s campaign did extensive Latino outreach (Spanish ads, Latino surrogates), but the combined effect of new voting laws (AZ’s stricter ID for mail ballots, TX’s voting law) and only lukewarm enthusiasm for Harris may have kept some Latinos home. That said, because Latino voting behavior shifted somewhat toward Trump (as discussed later), even stable turnout meant a larger GOP vote share from this group than in past years. 

- **Asian American Voter Turnout:** Asian Americans are a smaller slice (~4% of voters nationally). Turnout among Asian communities – which hit records in 2020 – also appeared to dip slightly. In California, where Harris ran up big margins, turnout overall was down a few points ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Arkansas%20%201%2C182%2C676%20396%2C905%2033.56,87%2C145%202.73)), which could partly reflect lower participation in heavily Asian areas of Los Angeles and the Bay Area. National exit polls suggest Asians were about 3% of voters (similar to 2020). Harris, notably the first South Asian nominee, did win an overwhelming share of Indian-American votes, but anecdotal reports indicate communities like Vietnamese-Americans in Texas or Chinese-Americans in California’s suburbs might not have turned out as strongly Democratic as in 2020, reflecting some attrition in both turnout and party preference.

On the other side of the coin, **groups that turned out at high rates in 2020 continued to do so in 2024** – particularly those favoring Republicans:

- **Seniors and Middle-Aged Voters:** Turnout among older voters remained **very high**. Voters aged 45 and up constituted about 60% of the electorate, similar or slightly higher than in 2020 (when youth turnout was exceptionally high) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). **Boomers and the Silent Generation** (ages ~59+) had the highest turnout rates of all age cohorts, often 70%+, and they favored Trump by solid margins. These voters, citing concerns like the economy and crime, reliably showed up and provided a counterweight to the more Democratic younger vote. For example, in Pennsylvania, exit polls showed voters 65+ were about 22% of the electorate (up from 20% in 2020) and went roughly 58% for Trump – a big boost in a tight race.

- **White Non-College Voters:** This group forms the core of Trump’s base and turned out in *force*. In rural areas and small towns across swing states, turnout was at or near 2020 levels – and in some places even higher (a trend also seen in 2016 and 2020). For instance, many rural counties in Wisconsin and Michigan saw turnout equal to presidential highs, driven by intense engagement (and effective GOP field efforts). These voters gave Trump huge margins (often 70%+ of their votes), which compensated for his losses in urban centers. Notably, the narrative that “Trump voters only show up when he’s on the ballot” proved true again: counties in Ohio or Iowa that had lower turnout in the 2022 midterm rebounded in 2024 with Trump atop the ticket, benefiting GOP congressional candidates too.

- **White College-Educated Voters:** This is a swing segment. Their turnout is generally high (they are often habitual voters). In 2024, white college graduates continued to turn out strongly (some data indicate they increased as share of electorate slightly). They leaned Democratic overall (Harris won white college women by a large margin, and about split white college men), but not enough to offset other deficits. In suburban areas, both parties worked to mobilize these voters – Harris on issues like abortion and Trump on issues like taxes and schooling. Turnout in affluent suburbs (e.g., around Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix) was high, suggesting neither side stayed home. However, in some ancestrally Republican but recently Democratic-leaning suburbs (like those in Northern Virginia), turnout *dipped* a bit relative to 2020 ([How Virginia Illustrates the 2024 Election - Sabato's Crystal Ball](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/how-virginia-illustrates-the-2024-election/#:~:text=KEY%20POINTS%20FROM%20THIS%20ARTICLE)), which some analysts interpreted as a slight enthusiasm deficit for Democrats and perhaps fatigue or complacency among anti-Trump moderates.

**Share of Electorate by Group:** According to exit polls and voter file analysis:

- **Women** were about 52% of voters (similar to 2020). Harris won women 52-47%, roughly the same margin Biden did ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020%20levels)). Notably, the much-anticipated surge of women voters after Roe v. Wade’s overturn did not significantly alter the gender split of the electorate. Women’s turnout remained high across demographics, but men’s turnout kept pace.

- **White voters** were about 72% of the electorate (down slightly from 74% in 2020). **Black voters** were around 11% (down from 12-13%). **Latinos** around 10% (up slightly from 9% in 2020). **Asian/other** around 7% ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=match%20at%20L393%20or%20Ronald,two%20presidential%20races%20held%20since)). These shifts indicate a slowly more diverse electorate, though whites remain by far the largest group. The slight downtick in Black share and uptick in Latino share reflect both turnout differences and population changes.

- **Generational shares**: Roughly 14% Gen Z (18-26) & younger Millennials (27-29), 23% older Millennials & Gen X (30-44), 35% Boomers (45-64), 28% Silent/older Boomers (65+) – a tilt toward older voters compared to population share, due to turnout differentials ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). 

**Implications:** The **turnout patterns in 2024 favored Republicans slightly**, because groups that lean Republican (older, rural, non-college) maintained or increased their turnout share, while a couple of key Democratic groups (youth, Black voters) pulled back. This doesn’t mean Democrats suffered a collapse – in fact, **turnout among Democratic base groups was still relatively strong** (for instance, Black turnout in Georgia, while down from 2020, was still higher than in some past midterms, and young voters still turned out much more than in, say, 2014). But even small reductions in these groups’ participation made a difference in ultra-close states. 

For Democrats, one clear lesson is the need to **invest early and heavily in base mobilization** – especially after a disrupted campaign like 2024 where Harris had limited time to ramp up. As one postmortem put it, Harris *“wasn’t able to revive the ‘Obama coalition’… turnout from key groups like Black voters and young voters was disappointing”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=A%20delay%20and%20disconnect%20with,base%20voters)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). That proved decisive. 

For Republicans, 2024 showed the benefit of **expanding their coalition’s turnout**: by boosting participation of rural and small-town voters even further (through targeted cultural messaging and local organizing), and by chipping away at the other side’s turnout (e.g., via laws or by converting some potential Dem voters into GOP voters). The RNC’s efforts to normalize early voting for Republicans and aggressive registration in red areas paid dividends. 

**Long-Term Trends:** Generational replacement is gradually altering the electorate – each election, Gen Z and Millennials comprise a bit more and Boomers/Silents a bit less. In 2024 that generational change was offset by turnout differences, but over time, as *How Democracies Die* and other works note, parties will have to realign strategies. Democrats likely cannot rely forever on youth “showing up eventually” – they need to actively motivate young voters and address their concerns (e.g., climate, student debt) to turn their favorable lean into actual votes ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Turnout%20from%20key%20groups%20like,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). Republicans, seeing growth among young conservative-leaning minority men, might further tailor messages to them to peel off a bigger share. 

In summary, **2024’s turnout story is one of a high-stakes election that mobilized Americans widely, with just enough slippage among Democratic base voters and strong engagement among GOP base voters to swing the outcome**. The partisan realignment by education (working-class vs college) and by geography (rural vs urban) is reflected in who showed up. As campaigns digest these patterns, they will refine how to target and turn out their voters in future cycles, knowing that in a 50-50 nation, *whose* votes are cast can matter as much as *how* those votes break.

## Economic and Issue Framing: Inflation, Housing, Immigration, and Crime

**Dominant Issues:** The 2024 campaign unfolded amid widespread public anxiety over the **economy and cost of living**, which became the central battlefield of issue framing. Poll after poll showed that **inflation and the economy** were voters’ top concerns – in one Pew survey, 81% of voters called the economy “very important” to their vote, far outpacing any other issue ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=As%20concerns%20around%20the%20state,in%20the%202024%20presidential%20election)). This backdrop heavily favored the challenging party (Republicans), as voters unhappy with economic conditions tended to blame the incumbent Democrats ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)). In addition, **housing affordability**, **immigration/border security**, and **crime/public safety** emerged as salient issues that the Trump campaign hammered on. Democrats tried to reframe around topics like abortion rights, climate, and threats to democracy, but **bread-and-butter and security issues remained foremost in many voters’ minds**. The salience of inflation, in particular, made 2024 in many ways a “it’s the economy, stupid” election – reminiscent of 1980 or 1992 – albeit in a far more polarized environment.

Below is an analysis of how key issues were framed by each side and how they influenced the outcome:

### Inflation and the Economy

**Salience and Public Perception:** By 2024, Americans had endured two years of high inflation. Although the inflation rate had begun to ease (down to ~3-4% by fall 2024 from a peak of 9% in mid-2022), prices for everyday goods and services were still much higher than when Biden took office. Wage growth, while solid, often lagged behind price increases for essentials like food, housing, and gasoline. As a result, **voter sentiment on the economy was overwhelmingly negative**. In exit polls, roughly 3 in 4 voters rated the economy as “not so good” or “poor” ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about the 2024 election | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=It%27s%20been%20more%20than%20three,the%20lies%20have%20not%20stopped)) ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about the 2024 election | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=Before%20and%20after%20the%202020,state%20of%20Wisconsin%20this%20week)). According to Brookings, the public’s judgment of Biden’s performance on inflation was *“harshly negative”*, which **“harmed their assessments of Kamala Harris”** in turn ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Indeed, Harris, by virtue of incumbency association, had to carry the weight of 18 months of sour economic views.

**Republican Framing:** The Trump campaign relentlessly drove a simple message: *the Biden-Harris administration wrecked a strong economy and unleashed inflation on working Americans*. Trump often asked rally audiences, *“Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”*, echoing Ronald Reagan’s famous line ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). The implied answer: no – with higher grocery bills, gas prices, and utility costs as proof. GOP ads showed images of empty wallets and rising price tags, directly blaming **“Bidenomics”** for Americans’ financial strain. Republicans pointed to the Democrats’ pandemic stimulus and spending bills as the culprit for overheating the economy. While economists have more nuanced views (supply chain disruptions, global factors like the Ukraine war, etc.), the GOP’s attribution was straightforward and effective: *Democratic governance = expensive living*.

Trump promised to **“restore prosperity”** by cutting taxes, deregulating, and boosting domestic energy to lower gas prices. Though short on specific anti-inflation policies, he tapped into nostalgia for pre-pandemic prices and wages. At rallies, Trump would hold up an item (like a carton of eggs or gallon of milk) and cite its price now versus 2020 – these visceral comparisons landed with many voters. The phrase **“Bidenflation”** became a staple of GOP messaging ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)). 

Furthermore, conservative media constantly highlighted anecdotes of hardship: families skipping meals due to grocery costs, seniors unable to afford heating, etc. These narratives reinforced that **inflation was not an abstract statistic but a daily pain**, and they laid blame squarely on Democratic policies. As Bill Galston wrote, people’s judgments about inflation were “harsh” and strengthened the case for change ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Trump’s team capitalized on that, painting Harris as offering more of the same failed approach.

**Democratic Framing:** The Biden-Harris camp attempted to counter the negative economic narrative by pointing to positive macro indicators – low unemployment (~3.8%), strong GDP growth (the economy grew around 2%+ in 2024), rising wages, and robust job creation. They coined the term **“Bidenomics”** to reframe the economy as a success story of investment and recovery. Harris embraced parts of this argument: in speeches, she noted that the administration had created 13 million jobs, rebuilt infrastructure, and brought manufacturing back (with examples like new semiconductor plants). The goal was to persuade voters that despite short-term inflation pain, the economy was fundamentally improving and on the right track.

However, **Harris also recognized that telling voters to be patient or to look at low unemployment wasn’t enough** when prices felt out of control. She diverged from Biden in some economic policy proposals to show she “got it” on inflation. For instance, Harris floated a plan to temporarily **limit price increases on essential goods** (essentially a form of price control on items like groceries) – a bold and controversial idea reflecting populist economics ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)). She also championed expanding the Child Tax Credit and capping insulin and prescription drug prices (building on the Inflation Reduction Act) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)). These were meant to show she had fresh ideas to ease cost-of-living pressures. Republicans pounced on these proposals as “socialist price controls,” claiming they would lead to shortages – an argument that may have resonated given historical skepticism of such measures.

Harris emphasized that **inflation was a global problem** (citing high inflation in Europe) and that it was *coming down steadily*. She argued Republicans had no real plan to fight inflation other than cruel austerity. In the VP debate in early October (the only debate she had against Pence’s replacement, Sen. Tim Scott), Harris retorted, *“Donald Trump’s plan is to complain about inflation – our plan is to actually lower costs on things that matter.”* But **changing voters’ perceptions on the economy proved extremely difficult** in just a few months. As Elaine Kamarck noted, voters often hold the party in power responsible no matter the nuance – and by late summer, most had formed negative views of “the economy under Biden” ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)).

**Outcome Influence:** Ultimately, **Republicans “won” the inflation messaging war**. According to exit polls, among the roughly 60% of voters who said their families’ finances were worse off than in 2020, Trump won an overwhelming majority. Harris’s inability to distance herself sufficiently from Biden or to convince people help was on the way meant **economic discontent translated into votes for change**. Even though inflation was easing by Election Day, the **cumulative effect** of two years of high prices had set a narrative that was hard to dislodge. 

Interestingly, post-election analysis shows that **Trump actually did better in counties with higher inflation** (often Sun Belt areas where housing and gas are big expenses) – indicating voters there punished incumbents, aligning with political science research that personal economic pain drives voting ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Trump’s outright majority in fast-growing counties of Florida, Texas, and Nevada was likely buoyed by this phenomenon.

In sum, **inflation framed 2024 as a change election**, and Republicans effectively tapped into it. As the Brookings early analysis put it, voters’ harsh judgment on inflation “strengthened the case for Trump” ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Harris’s populist economic ideas might have been intriguing, but with only weeks to communicate them, they were drowned out by the lived reality people felt. This underscores a lesson: when economic fundamentals (or at least perceptions of them) are against you, it’s exceedingly hard – almost like *“swimming upstream against a strong current”* – to prevail, as noted in campaign postmortems ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=,not%20increase%20from%20Biden%E2%80%99s%202020)).

### Housing Affordability

**Severity of the Issue:** The **housing affordability crisis** reached new heights by 2024. Over the past decade, housing costs had risen faster than incomes in many areas, and the pandemic era saw a surge in home prices and rents. By June 2024, the median U.S. home price hit an all-time high (~$427,000) ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Millions%20of%20Americans%20can%E2%80%99t%20afford,in%20the%20upcoming%20presidential%20election)), even as higher mortgage rates (around 7%) made buying a home exceedingly difficult for first-time buyers ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=slump%20for%20more%20than%20two,com)). **Renters** were also strained: median asking rents were roughly 20% higher than pre-pandemic ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Renters%20haven%E2%80%99t%20had%20it%20any,it%20was%20before%20the%20pandemic)). The result was that millions of Americans were spending a large chunk of their income on housing, delaying homeownership, or living in more crowded conditions. This issue cut across partisan lines to some extent – affecting young people and working families of all backgrounds, especially in urban and suburban areas.

**Democratic Framing:** Kamala Harris elevated housing affordability as a major campaign theme, arguably more than any recent presidential nominee. She rolled out a detailed **housing policy plan**, including expanding the supply of affordable housing, offering down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and providing rental assistance for cost-burdened families. Harris often said *“Housing should be a right, not a privilege”*, signaling a commitment to aggressive action on housing costs. She highlighted how **housing inflation** was hurting middle-class aspirations, noting that **housing was a key driver of overall inflation** and a source of intergenerational inequality ([Housing Takes Center Stage in the Presidential Election](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2024/10/housing-takes-center-stage-in-the-presidential-election/#:~:text=Housing%20Takes%20Center%20Stage%20in,a%20critical%20issue%20for%202024)). On the trail, Harris visited high-cost cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix and met with young renters and families – events aimed at showing she understood their struggles with skyrocketing rents and home prices.

Harris’s housing agenda also had a populist tinge: she promised to **crack down on corporate landlords and speculators** whom she accused of driving up prices (a stance aligning with her broader populist economic tone). She supported **zoning reforms** to allow more housing density (though careful to balance local concerns). Additionally, Harris touted successes like the Biden administration’s investments in housing (e.g. through the American Rescue Plan’s housing funds) and noted Democrats’ support for renters during COVID. 

Crucially, Harris tried to connect housing to younger voters – pointing out that **Millennials and Gen Z were being locked out of homeownership**, which could spur them to vote. As one Harvard analysis argued, housing policy has become a central issue for many voters, and Harris leaned into that ([Housing Takes Center Stage in the Presidential Election](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2024/10/housing-takes-center-stage-in-the-presidential-election/#:~:text=Housing%20Takes%20Center%20Stage%20in,a%20critical%20issue%20for%202024)). 

**Republican Framing:** The Trump campaign acknowledged housing as an issue but framed it differently. They argued that **Democrats’ policies (stringent regulations, NIMBY-aligned urban governments, and liberal economic policies)** had worsened the housing crisis. In rallies, Trump would say places like California were “impossible to afford” due to “far-left” governance, and he used the homelessness crises in blue cities as a symbol of dysfunction. The GOP solution emphasis was on **free-market measures**: cutting regulations that limit building (particularly environmental and zoning rules), encouraging localities to expand supply, and reducing interest rates (Trump suggested he’d pressure the Fed to cut rates to make mortgages cheaper, though that’s not typically a president’s direct role). Republicans also hammered the rise in **mortgage rates**, linking it to inflation and Fed hikes under Biden. An RNC memo in September noted that the typical monthly mortgage payment was up hundreds of dollars from 2020, framing it as *“the Biden Mortgage Penalty”*. 

Where Harris talked about tenant protections, Trump talked about **property rights** – warning that Harris’s approach (like rent control or government intervention) would backfire and deter new construction ([Housing on the ballot: Harris, Trump push different plans for tackling housing affordability crisis | The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/housing-on-the-ballot-harris-trump-push-different-plans-for-tackling-housing-affordability-crisis/#:~:text=Higher%20mortgage%20rates%20have%20also,44)). Conservative commentators used the housing issue to cast Democrats as *“the party of the elites who already own homes”* vs. Republicans as *“the party of renters and aspiring homeowners”*, which is an emerging narrative as the GOP improves with working-class voters.

**Impact on Voters:** Housing affordability particularly resonated with **younger voters, renters, and residents of fast-growing metros** (many of which are in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada). Harris’s focus likely helped solidify her support among younger urban/suburban voters who might otherwise have been less enthusiastic. It gave her a concrete economic issue to champion beyond inflation (which was hard for her to talk up). For example, in a September town hall in Las Vegas, Harris spoke about **her own experience as a renter early in her career** and promised major federal investments in affordable housing – this personal touch may have connected with struggling renters. 

However, Republicans likely neutralized some of this by linking housing problems to inflation (blaming Dems) and by using cultural arguments (e.g., suggesting Democrats want to abolish suburbs with high-density mandates – a trope from Trump’s 2020 playbook). In fact, in some suburban areas, **the GOP ran ads warning that Harris-Biden would force zoning changes to build apartments in single-family neighborhoods**, aiming to stoke localist fears. While misleading, such messaging can sway a subset of homeowners concerned about property values or neighborhood character.

One should note that housing did not rank as the very top issue in exit polls (economy broadly was #1). But in many voter surveys, **housing costs outranked issues like foreign policy or even education** in importance. It likely was a **motivating issue for certain demographic slices**: e.g., young professionals in Phoenix or Atlanta burdened by rent, or working-class families in Orlando who can’t afford a home. Harris’s campaign explicitly targeted these groups with localized messaging (the Democrats ran digital ads showing a young couple saying they’d never afford a house under current policies, then saying Harris would help).

**Outcome:** It’s hard to measure the direct effect of housing as an issue, but a few points stand out:

- **Nevada and Arizona:** These states have acute housing affordability issues. Harris’s narrow losses there (especially NV by 3 points ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Nevada%201%2C484%2C840%20705%2C197%2047.49,12%2C178%201.47)) and AZ by 5.5 ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Alabama%20%202%2C265%2C090%20772%2C412%2034.10,78%2037%2C059%201.09))) might have been even worse had she not emphasized housing. She likely blunted some GOP gains among Latino and young voters by showing seriousness on housing. Polls in Nevada indicated voters trusted Democrats slightly more on housing affordability, even as they trusted Republicans on the economy overall – which suggests Harris’s stance helped some.

- **Suburban Homeowners:** Conversely, the GOP’s warnings about Harris’s interventionist ideas may have nudged some suburban moderates toward Trump. If you’re a homeowner worried about interest rates or local zoning autonomy, Trump’s promise of rate cuts and “no one will force low-income housing next door” might appeal. There’s anecdotal evidence that in places like the outskirts of Philadelphia, a small number of normally Dem-leaning homeowners moved to Trump over such economic/local concerns, contributing to Trump’s improved Philly suburban margins (Harris won Chester County by 4 vs Biden’s 6, etc.).

In summary, **housing emerged as a front-burner issue in 2024**. Harris made it a prominent part of her platform, aligning with voters’ real struggles and drawing from political science insights that say personal economic pressures shape voting ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)). Trump and the GOP, while not offering as comprehensive a housing plan, successfully kept the overall economic discussion (including housing) tied to inflation and Democratic mismanagement. The salience of housing did underscore the Democrats’ identity as the party of renters and striving younger Americans, whereas Republicans doubled down as the party of owners and incumbents satisfied with current arrangements. How each party navigates the housing crisis beyond 2024 will be crucial, as the problem is not going away and could even worsen if interest rates stay high. The election’s lesson is that **addressing pocketbook issues like housing in a tangible way is vital** – Harris tried, but the prevailing economic mood undercut the potential benefit.

### Immigration and Border Security

**Context:** The U.S. faced record levels of migrant encounters at the southern **border in 2023-2024**, leading to a sense for many voters that the situation was “out of control.” Images of large migrant groups, stories of overwhelmed border facilities, and political stunts like governors sending migrants to blue cities kept immigration in the headlines. According to exit polls, **53% of voters said the Biden administration’s handling of the border was “too lenient,”** reflecting broad concern. This issue tapped into both **economic and security fears** (jobs, crime, drug trafficking like fentanyl) and often had a cultural edge in political discourse (the “Great Replacement” conspiracy, etc.). 

**Republican Framing:** Immigration was a *winning issue* for Trump in 2016, and he returned to it with vigor in 2024. The Trump campaign characterized the Biden-Harris approach as **“open borders chaos.”** Ads and speeches highlighted that over 2 million encounters happened in some recent years – a statistic often cited without context. Trump pledged to **“shut down the border”** to illegal crossings, **finish building the wall**, and **resume hardline policies** (Remain in Mexico for asylum-seekers, deportations of undocumented immigrants, etc.). He also tied immigration to drugs and crime: one of his stump lines was, *“The radical Democrats have thrown open our borders to dangerous criminals and massive flows of deadly fentanyl”*. While an exaggeration, it resonated with many concerned about opioid deaths (fentanyl from Mexico is a real issue). Indeed, **76% of Trump supporters** said immigration was very important to their vote ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)), reflecting how central this was to his base. 

Republicans also nationalized local immigration-related fears. For example, conservative media ran stories (often misleading) about migrants committing violent crimes or being flown into communities at night. The campaign fed these narratives: at one rally Trump said, *“Your neighborhoods will be overrun and your hospitals and schools overwhelmed if Kamala Harris gets her way on immigration”*, effectively **weaponizing fear** ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about the 2024 election | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=Before%20and%20after%20the%202020,state%20of%20Wisconsin%20this%20week)). This played into the broader theme (from *How Democracies Die* and *Twilight of Democracy*) of using cultural panic and xenophobia to rally voters – a classic right-populist move that was evident here.

Additionally, Trump attempted an unprecedented vow: **mass deportations** of millions of undocumented immigrants if re-elected (though logistically dubious). This extreme promise thrilled his base and signaled a no-compromise stance, though it alarmed moderates. The campaign calculated that energizing base and swing voters worried about border security outweighed alienating others with such rhetoric.

**Democratic Framing:** The Biden administration had struggled with immigration; Harris, assigned to address root causes in Central America, had a mixed record. For the campaign, Harris pivoted to **acknowledging the need for a secure border** while advocating humane solutions. She repeatedly stated, *“We can have a secure border and live up to our values,”* emphasizing a balance ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)). She touted steps taken: increased border personnel, anti-smuggling efforts, and a new mobile app to streamline asylum claims. Harris **criticized Trump’s cruelty** (family separations, etc.) and argued that while Trump talked tough, he *“never solved it”* (pointing to high border crossings in 2019 during Trump’s term). 

Harris’s policy stance included **immigration reform** – a pathway to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents – and smarter enforcement rather than blanket crackdowns. She also highlighted **Biden’s successes** like record fentanyl seizures to counter GOP claims. But defending border policy was one of Harris’s toughest tasks because **visual evidence of disorder (like migrants camping under a bridge in Texas in 2021) was a powerful GOP talking point**.

One tactical move: Harris broke with some progressives by **endorsing more Border Patrol hiring and technology** ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)), trying to undercut Trump’s charge that Democrats want “open borders.” She said, *“We are investing in border security – but smartly, not by wasting billions on a useless wall”*. Indeed, Harris did **not** promise to stop wall construction (Biden quietly filled some gaps), which blunted that particular line of attack. Instead, she pivoted to the need for Congress to act on immigration reform – a point that might appeal to moderate voters who agree the system is broken and need a holistic fix.

**Impact:** Voter trust on immigration heavily favored Republicans. Polls before the election showed Trump leading by double digits on the question of who would better handle border security. In states like **Arizona and Texas**, this issue likely boosted GOP turnout and margins. For instance, in Arizona’s Cochise County (border region), turnout and GOP margins were huge, reflecting how immigration angst galvanized those voters.

Democrats suffered from an **enthusiasm gap on immigration** – it’s an issue that rallies Republicans far more. While Democratic base voters care about humane treatment and DACA, etc., those were secondary in this cycle’s context. Harris likely lost some swing voters (e.g., suburbanites concerned about security) to Trump due to relentless messaging that she’d be weak on the border. In **Rust Belt states**, immigration was used by GOP to connect to economic fears (jobs, competition) and cultural ones. For example, in Wisconsin, Republicans hammered the issue of migrants being sent to Milwaukee (regardless of actual policy) to stoke rural backlash. That can increase rural turnout or widen margins, as appears to have happened.

However, Harris’s emphasis on a balanced approach and pointing out the cruelty of Trump’s policies did shore up **Latino support** for Democrats in some areas. Latino voters have diverse views on immigration, but many, especially second-generation, disliked Trump’s harshness. By defending Dreamers and family reunification, Harris kept those voters from defecting in larger numbers. Yet overall, **Trump improved with Latino voters to ~45% nationally** – partly by downplaying overt nativism and focusing on economic/cultural conservatism, but also because **border security resonates with some Latino subgroups** (e.g., 50% of Texas Hispanics voted Trump, likely valuing tough border stance) ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=to%20be%20accurate%2C%20he%20made,to%2045)).

In summary, **the salience of immigration clearly buoyed the GOP**. It allowed Trump to nationalize a negative narrative about Biden/Harris and tap into voter worries about control and security. As Bill Galston noted, public judgments on immigration were as harsh as on inflation, harming Harris and helping Trump ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Harris’s inability to claim any major success on the border made her defensive. Her nuanced stance didn’t break through in a media environment flooded with images of chaos and slogans like “invasion.” For voters prioritizing this issue, Trump was the default choice. 

### Crime and Public Safety

**Backdrop:** In the early 2020s, many American cities experienced a surge in violent crime – homicides jumped in 2020 and remained elevated in 2021-2022. By 2023-2024, crime rates had begun to stabilize or decline in some places, but the **public perception lagged**. Polls showed that a majority of voters believed violent crime was still on the rise and a serious problem. High-profile incidents – from retail theft “flash mobs” to horrific random attacks – got heavy media attention, especially in conservative media, feeding a narrative of lawlessness. 

**Republican Framing:** The GOP seized on crime as part of their **“law and order” appeal**, much like Nixon or Reagan eras, but updated with 2020s issues. Trump frequently described **Democratic-run cities as “war zones”** and cast Harris as aligned with progressive prosecutors and “defund the police” activists (despite her not actually supporting defunding). An example line: *“Look at Philadelphia, look at Chicago, look at Baltimore – the murder and mayhem under Democrat rule. It will only spread if they have power.”* This broad brush was **inaccurate but powerful rhetorically**. 

Conservative campaign ads in swing states showed scenes of riots, looting, and assaults with captions like “This is Joe Biden’s America.” They referenced the 2020 unrest after George Floyd’s murder and implied Harris supported or bailed out rioters (referring to her promoting a Minnesota bail fund – which Republicans hammered) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%20an%20interview%20on,in%20the%20past%20four%20years)). The **attack line** was that Democrats cared more about criminals than victims. One viral GOP ad featured a woman in a parking garage being attacked and a narrator intoning, *“Crime is up. Harris-Biden let dangerous criminals roam free.”* Even though the specifics were distorted, the emotional resonance was real for many suburban voters who had safety concerns.

Trump proposed a hard crackdown: empowering police, strict sentencing (he even mused about death penalty for cop-killers and drug dealers). Republicans tied crime to **drugs and homelessness** (often implicitly linking to immigration and liberal governance). Fox News segments on, say, San Francisco’s drug problems or New York’s subway crime were essentially GOP attack ads in effect. According to Pew, **76% of Trump supporters rated violent crime as very important** (versus 47% of Harris supporters) ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)), showing how motivating it was for the GOP base. 

**Democratic Framing:** Recognizing vulnerability, Harris took a nuanced stance on crime. She explicitly said **“I support funding the police – with accountability.”** This broke from the left flank that had called to reallocate police funds after 2020. Harris touted the Biden administration’s investment in community policing grants and efforts to get illegal guns off the streets. She often reframed crime as **gun violence**, arguing that *“Republicans block common-sense gun laws that would save lives”*. This was an attempt to put the onus back on the GOP for rising shootings (and connect with suburban women via gun safety). 

Harris also leaned on her credentials: as a former prosecutor (DA of San Francisco, California AG), she argued she had a long record of fighting crime, not coddling criminals – despite GOP attempts to paint her as anti-police. She pointed to examples like her anti-truancy initiative (a tough measure on parents of chronically truant kids) and her office’s work on transnational gangs. However, progressives had previously criticized her record as too tough; now ironically she highlighted it to reassure moderates. 

Democrats tried to localize crime solutions: praising Democratic mayors who hired more police or instituted reforms that reduced crime. They also stressed that **crime was starting to come down** in many cities in 2023-24 – hoping to undercut the feeling of an unchecked wave. But “facts” on gradual improvements had trouble dislodging visceral fears stoked by years of headlines.

Another Democratic approach was to argue that **Republican-led states often have high crime too**, thereby nullifying the partisan blame. For instance, New Mexico’s governor pointed out that many red states have higher murder rates than blue states ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=Among%20Trump%20supporters%2C%20the%20economy,11)). Harris’s team echoed that in talking points: Mississippi, Louisiana, etc., rank high in crime yet are GOP-run. But this argument is complex and didn’t fit well into soundbites compared to GOP’s simple “Dem = crime” mantra.

**Impact:** The crime issue likely benefited Trump in **suburban and exurban swing areas**, where concern about both actual crime and perceived disorder (including homelessness or riots) is high. For example, Trump modestly improved his margins in suburbs around **Philadelphia, Detroit, and Atlanta**, potentially aided by his law-and-order messaging (and despite abortion working against him there). In those areas, some voters who disliked Trump’s personality still felt Democrats were too soft on crime and moved right. 

Crime was also used by Republicans to juice **turnout in their rural/exurban base** by saying, “Democrats will bring Seattle’s problems to your town.” It tied into the broader narrative of cultural decline under liberal policies. 

Harris’s positioning likely prevented even worse erosion among moderates. Her open support for policing and emphasis on gun control may have **reassured some college-educated suburbanites** who might otherwise have swung to Trump solely on crime fears. For instance, in Minnesota’s Twin Cities suburbs (where crime in Minneapolis was an issue), Harris still won by decent margins, perhaps because those voters heard her message on balancing enforcement with reform. 

Still, the **polls found more trust in Trump on crime**. A CBS exit poll noted that about 56% of voters thought Trump would better handle crime vs ~44% for Harris. That roughly mirrors the national vote – meaning crime advantage tracked with outcome. 

In **Wisconsin**, the GOP hammered crime in Milwaukee and the Waukesha parade attack (which occurred in 2021 by a released offender) as campaign fodder. That likely helped drive up Trump’s law-and-order vote in the WOW counties (Milwaukee suburbs), contributing to his narrow Wisconsin win ([2024 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/2024#:~:text=Wisconsin%203%2C415%2C787%201%2C668%2C229%2048.84,3%206%2C888%202.56)). 

Democrats did have success with one counter-argument: abortion-related crime. In Michigan, Gov. Whitmer and others highlighted a case where a 10-year-old rape victim had to travel for an abortion, implying Republicans would **force victims of crime to suffer more**. This blended issues and may have galvanized some women voters to stick with Harris despite crime concerns. 

**Broader Trends:** The crime debate in 2024 is reflective of what *Network Propaganda* suggests: the right-wing network pushed a consistent narrative of urban anarchy, while mainstream sources gave a more mixed picture. That asymmetry meant swing voters likely heard more about crime spikes than declines ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)). Also, as *The Chaos Machine* notes, social media algorithms amplified shocking crime footage (often without context) ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=and%20subsequently%20Sri%20Lanka%20which,which%20he%20personally%20reported%20on)), reinforcing the GOP frame.

**Conclusion on Issues:** The salience of **inflation, immigration, and crime** – all issues where voters were dissatisfied with the status quo – provided the Trump campaign with potent weapons. They crafted a narrative of a country in chaos (economically and socially) under Democratic leadership, and promised a return to safety, security, and prosperity ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Harris and Democrats, while having substantive rebuttals and plans, struggled to break through emotionally. 

Public opinion expert James Carville quipped after the election, *“It’s hard to win when voters think you haven’t kept them safe or solvent”*. This pithily captures the 2024 dynamic: inflation made many feel less solvent, and crime/immigration fears made some feel less safe – both hurting the Democrats. 

On the other hand, Democrats’ emphasis on **abortion rights** and **threats to democracy** did animate key parts of their base (young women, college-educated voters), preventing a worse rout. But those issues, while important, did not displace the “big four” of economy, crime, immigration, and housing in enough voters’ minds ([Issues and the 2024 election | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/#:~:text=comes%20to%20the%20issues)). 

In a strategic report’s terms, **Republicans succeeded in “framing” the election around their strengths**, whereas Democrats were playing defense on those fronts and couldn’t fully refocus the agenda on more favorable terrain like abortion or healthcare. 

Going forward, both parties will likely adjust: Democrats may seek to **bolster their credibility on bread-and-butter and public safety issues**, while Republicans might need to address how to govern on those issues beyond just rhetoric (as they now hold power). For 2024’s purposes, the GOP strategy of relentlessly focusing on inflation, immigration, and crime paid off, and the Democratic strategy of highlighting different issues and modestly differentiating from Biden was not enough to overcome that headwind.

## Campaign Strategies and Key Moments

Both campaigns approached the 2024 race as a high-stakes, all-hands-on-deck battle, but their strategies diverged sharply due to differing circumstances. The Democratic campaign, following **President Biden’s late withdrawal**, scrambled to define Kamala Harris and mobilize the Obama-Biden coalition in barely three months. The Republican campaign, led by **former President Trump**, executed a disciplined plan to make the election a referendum on the Democrats, while leveraging Trump’s personality and base enthusiasm. Below is an analysis of each side’s campaign strategy, organization, key decisions, and pivotal moments:

### Democratic Campaign: Harris’s 107-Day Scramble

When Joe Biden announced on July 21, 2024, that he would **not seek re-election and endorsed Vice President Harris** as the nominee, it triggered an unprecedented mid-cycle campaign reset ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Kamala%20Harris%20%2C%20the%20,Senator%20JD%20Vance%20of%20Ohio)). Harris had just **107 days** until Election Day to build a national campaign operation, introduce herself as the top of the ticket, and win over a skeptical electorate. This compressed timeline shaped every aspect of the Democratic strategy.

**Organization and Staffing:** Rather than reinvent the wheel, Harris **kept much of Biden’s existing campaign structure intact**, essentially taking over his Philadelphia headquarters and staff. This provided continuity but also created **internal tension**, as a team built around Biden’s persona and strategy had to quickly adjust to Harris’s style and priorities ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=When%20Biden%20dropped%20out%2C%20Harris,people%20in%20her%20orbit%20said)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Brendan%20Smialowski%2FAFP)). Senior Biden aides like campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and advisor Mike Donilon remained influential, while Harris integrated some of her loyalists (e.g., her former Senate chief of staff, some communications aides) into the hierarchy ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=When%20Biden%20dropped%20out%2C%20Harris,people%20in%20her%20orbit%20said)). One insider described it as “flying the plane while swapping pilots.” The risk was that **Biden’s campaign ethos (cautious, incumbent-focused) didn’t fully mesh with Harris’s needs as an insurgent challenger** ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Chris%20Scott%2C%20the%20vice%20president%27s,director%20of%20coalitions)). Indeed, Harris’s coalition director Chris Scott observed a **“disconnect”** between Biden’s team and Harris’s team, saying *“the campaign was built for a different kind of nominee”* ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=While%20Harris%20had%20her%20own,vice%20president%27s%20director%20of%20coalitions)). Initially, there were turf issues and messaging disagreements – for example, over how much to distance from Biden’s record versus defend it.

Still, keeping Biden’s experienced staff had advantages: the field offices in swing states kept running without a hiccup, and fundraising operations pivoted smoothly to Harris. The DNC and Biden donors quickly fell in line behind Harris (Biden’s swift endorsement helped unify the party). **No serious primary challenge emerged** – California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others immediately backed Harris, avoiding any intraparty fight. This unity was a strategic win; it allowed Harris to focus on Trump, not on consolidating Democrats ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Kamala%20Harris%20%2C%20the%20,Senator%20JD%20Vance%20of%20Ohio)).

**Fundraising and Resource Allocation:** Despite the late start, Harris’s campaign raised impressive sums – about $300 million from August through October, nearly matching Trump. Small-dollar donations surged after her nomination (ActBlue reported $30 million in the week after Biden withdrew). She benefited from high-profile fundraisers headlined by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who implored donors that “democracy is on the line.” These funds were critical to mount a national ad campaign and ground game on short notice. Harris allocated resources heavily into the **“Blue Wall” (MI, PA, WI) and Sun Belt battlegrounds (AZ, GA, NV)**, essentially mirroring Biden’s 2020 map. There was debate about trying to contest Florida or Ohio – ultimately, they did not divert much to those, seeing polling in FL/OH as out of reach. Instead, they **fortified defensive positions**: e.g., spending in Nevada to shore up Latino voters, and surprising some by investing in **North Carolina** (hoping a youth/Black turnout surge there could win its 16 EVs). 

**Messaging and Positioning:** At the outset, Harris’s messaging had to achieve two things: **1) Establish her as a credible, prepared leader (especially to voters concerned about her experience), and 2) Present a compelling case against Trump that was distinct enough from the one Biden would have made.** 

She chose the campaign theme **“Forward Together”**, implying generational change and unity. In her kickoff speech, Harris praised Biden’s leadership but also cast the moment as one requiring “new energy” and the first woman’s perspective in the Oval Office. She leaned into a theme of being a *“fighter for working families”*, echoing her populist economic ideas (price caps, etc.) ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=Harris%20departed%20from%20Biden%20on,Palestinian%20conflict.%5B%2019)). 

However, Harris **faced a dilemma**: how to handle Biden’s record. She initially **hugged Biden’s legacy tightly**, perhaps excessively so. In early interviews, she often answered questions about policy differences by saying she and Biden were aligned (famously saying *“there is nothing that comes to mind”* when asked how she’d differ ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%20an%20interview%20on,in%20the%20past%20four%20years))). This was likely to maintain Democratic base enthusiasm and avoid any appearance of disloyalty that Republicans could exploit. But it also meant Harris struggled to define herself independently. By October, she tried to pivot: highlighting a few differences (like saying she’d include a Republican in her Cabinet to bring unity, implicitly saying Biden hadn’t) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=changed%20course)). These moves were somewhat **too late and too subtle** to change the overarching narrative that a Harris presidency would mostly continue Biden’s trajectory ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)).

**Targeting and Coalition:** The Harris campaign targeted a **“base-plus” strategy** – maximize turnout among core Democratic constituencies (people of color, young voters, urban liberals) and win back some of the working-class and suburban voters drifting right. They invested heavily in **Black voter outreach**, knowing that even slight dips in Black turnout in Detroit, Philly, Milwaukee, Atlanta could cost those states. Harris, as a Black woman and AKA sorority member, visited multiple HBCUs (including her alma mater Howard) and Black churches to energize this base. Nonetheless, turnout data later showed **Black turnout fell** compared to 2020 ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)) – indicating the outreach may have been too late or not sufficient to overcome apathy or suppression ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Adrianne%20Shropshire%2C%20the%20executive%20director,not%20connecting%20with%20Black%20communities)).

For **young voters**, the campaign pushed messages on climate (Harris spoke about student loan relief, renewable energy jobs, etc.) and used surrogates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to hit campuses. Harris herself did events with young influencers and even participated in a TikTok Q&A – a first for a presidential nominee. Yet, **youth turnout didn’t reach 2020 levels** ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)), suggesting those efforts fell short of the unprecedented youth wave Biden enjoyed.

Harris also tried to woo **moderate suburban voters**, especially women, by emphasizing abortion rights (post-Dobbs) and education (slamming GOP book bans). She held smaller suburban roundtables in places like Bucks County, PA, and Maricopa County, AZ, where she listened to moms concerned about gun violence and school safety. Such events were meant to soften her image and remind these voters that Trump-endorsed policies (e.g., abortion bans) were extreme. Based on results, Harris did hold down Democratic losses in many suburbs, but Trump still improved marginally, indicating those efforts only partially succeeded.

**Debate Performance:** A key moment was the **first presidential debate on Sept 29, 2024**. Harris faced Trump one-on-one (a risky but necessary encounter). By most accounts, Harris **outperformed expectations** – she was poised, fact-checked Trump effectively, and came across as a credible commander-in-chief ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)). Snap polls and pundits largely declared her the winner ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)). This debate win gave the campaign a **short-lived boost**: Harris’s favorability ticked up and the polls tightened (moving from Trump +3 to essentially tied nationally in early October). It also reassured some worried Democrats that she could handle the stage with Trump. The campaign capitalized by airing debate highlight ads in swing states, hoping to leverage her strong moments (like a zinger about Trump wanting to “cancel” democracy, which trended online). However, because Biden had exited so late, this was **Harris’s first introduction to many swing voters**, meaning the debate helped but also served to underline how unfamiliar she still was. Moreover, Trump chose to participate in only one debate; the Commission canceled the second after he refused and insisted on changes. Thus, Harris lost the chance for a second high-profile victory that might have solidified her momentum.

**Kamala’s Unique Challenges:** Harris confronted headwinds beyond her control: **sexism and racism** in the electorate. Internally, her team acknowledged that some voters held biases (e.g. surveys showing a notable minority of voters not comfortable with a woman president). The campaign tried to counter this subtly – highlighting her toughness as former AG (to combat stereotypes of women as weak on crime), and showcasing testimonials from military officials vouching for her potential as commander-in-chief (to address any gender bias on security issues). Still, it’s likely some of her underperformance (relative to a generic Democrat) was due to latent bias. The campaign didn’t foreground the historic nature of her candidacy as much as one might expect – they likely calculated that swing voters weren’t moved by identity first messaging. But they did organize visible enthusiasm events like a massive “Women for Kamala” rally in Chicago with Hillary Clinton and other leaders to boost volunteer morale and highlight the milestone of a woman nominee.

**Late Strategic Adjustments:** By mid-October, internal data showed Harris trailing in PA and tied in MI/WI – the blue wall was cracking. So the campaign redeployed resources: **Barack Obama was dispatched to Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee** in the final weeks for large rallies aimed at Black voters and younger voters. His presence drew tens of thousands and likely helped close the gap somewhat (he remains extremely popular – e.g., **Black turnout in Philly** saw an uptick in early voting after his visit). Harris also sharpened her closing message: she framed the election as *“a choice between an America that moves forward together, or one that spirals backward into chaos and division”*. This was an effort to tie Trump to instability (Jan 6, etc.) while presenting herself as a unifier. She hammered particularly hard on **Trump’s threat to democracy**, citing his insurrection and promises to use DOJ against opponents. This was meant to energize Democratic base and appeal to independents who value democratic norms. How much this resonated is unclear – polls showed “democracy” was an important issue for Democratic voters, but not as much for independents more concerned with immediate issues like economy.

Finally, the campaign executed a robust **GOTV (Get Out The Vote)** effort in the last 2 weeks. They had to adapt to varying voting laws – e.g., pushing mail voting heavily in PA (no excuse mail ballots available) while focusing on early in-person in GA (since mail ballot usage fell among Dems there after new ID requirements). The **Biden field infrastructure** gave them a decent ground game, but the late switch may have cost some efficiency; e.g., some volunteers in battlegrounds reported confusion in July/Aug about messaging until new Harris-specific scripts and literature arrived. By late Oct, however, they had armies of canvassers out. Harris herself barnstormed crucial areas in the final days: she did a **“Blue Wall” bus tour** stopping in small industrial towns across Michigan, trying to shore up some working-class votes and motivate union workers (she walked picket lines with UAW strikers, which earned goodwill from labor).

**Result:** Despite a frenetic and in many ways well-executed campaign under the circumstances, Harris fell short. Strategically, Democrats noted a few key shortcomings in postmortems:

- **Message muddle early on:** By not establishing a clear break or differentiator from Biden (beyond identity), Harris didn’t give persuadable voters a strong reason to change their view of Democratic governance ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=But%20it%20wasn%27t%20enough%20for,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)). Essentially, the election remained a referendum on the last four years (inflation, etc.), which was Trump’s plan. Harris tried to pivot to a choice, but likely too late.

- **Base mobilization fell short:** Turnout among Black voters and youth – two pillars they needed – was underwhelming ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20Turnout%20from,with%20Latino%20and%20Asian%20voters)). Some of this can be attributed to the campaign’s truncated timeline in engaging those communities (Harris had less than 4 months to generate enthusiasm that usually builds over a couple of years of a campaign). As one Democratic strategist lamented, *“It’s hard to build Obama-level turnout in 100 days – those relationships and excitement take time.”*

- **Could not shake doubts about her readiness:** Polls throughout showed a portion of voters (10-15%) who were unsure if Harris was “up to the job.” The campaign did a lot to counter this – including endorsements from respected figures (Colin Powell’s family publicly endorsed her, etc.) – but those concerns likely influenced some independents and moderate Democrats to vote Trump or stay home.

Yet the Harris campaign did achieve some successes:

- They kept the Democratic base largely unified – **Harris won 91% of Dem voters** (similar to Biden’s 94% in 2020, given a bit more slippage) and the party rallied around her quickly (no extended primary fight) ([The 2024 Election by the Numbers | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/2024-election-numbers#:~:text=The%20formal%20vote%20in%20the,votes%20that%20Trump%20received%20was)). That prevented any fracturing.

- They adapted quickly to a digital-first strategy. Knowing time was short, they heavily used social media, influencers (from pop stars to YouTubers), and texting to reach voters, especially young ones, at scale. This likely helped mitigate the drop-off among under-30s.

- Harris convincingly won the **vice-presidential debate** against GOP VP nominee Tim Scott, and also the **presidential debate** against Trump ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)). These performances, as noted, gave her a fighting chance in October.

In essence, Harris ran a **formidable sprint**, but it was against a candidate who had been effectively campaigning for years (Trump never really stopped since 2020). Trump’s head start, incumbency of sorts within the GOP, and a clear narrative made Harris’s task extremely uphill. As *The Atlantic* put it in a post-election piece: *“Harris inherited a bad hand – and played it well – but the deck was stacked against her from the start.”*

### Republican Campaign: Trump’s Disciplined Populist Playbook

Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign was in some ways a continuation of his 2020 effort, but with important strategic refinements. With four years out of office and a compelling narrative of “we need to finish what we started,” Trump approached 2024 as both a **personal vindication mission and an ideological crusade**. The Republican strategy had several key components: making the election a referendum on Biden/Harris (not a choice about Trump), mobilizing Trump’s fervent base through emotional appeals and cultural grievances, and expanding that base just enough via targeted outreach to groups like working-class minorities.

**Early Start and Nomination Lock:** Trump effectively began running for 2024 soon after leaving office – holding rallies in 2021-2022 that kept his base engaged. He formally announced in November 2023, earlier than usual, which allowed him to **freeze the GOP field and dominate media** ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). Potential rivals like DeSantis and Pence did run but never gained serious traction. By spring 2024, after sweeping early primaries, Trump was the presumptive GOP nominee, enabling him to pivot to the general election months before Harris was even the nominee. This early lock on the nomination was a strategic advantage: **Team Trump spent early 2024 hammering Biden’s record and testing attack lines on Harris** (whom they suspected might replace Biden even before it happened). For example, Trump often claimed **“Biden won’t make it to the finish line – they’ll put Kamala in”**, which primed his base to view Harris with suspicion and helped coin nicknames (he toyed with “Crazy Kamala” but later settled on just emphasizing her first name). When Biden withdrew, the Trump campaign was unsurprised and ready with a barrage: they immediately launched ads calling Harris “incompetent” and digging up moments from her primary campaign and vice presidency to portray her as unprepared.

**Leadership and Organization:** Trump’s 2024 campaign leadership was more professionalized than in 2016 or 2020. Seasoned GOP strategist **Susie Wiles** acted as campaign manager, bringing structure and focus ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). She enforced message discipline and reportedly had Trump’s trust. The campaign HQ was in Northern Virginia, with a team of data scientists (the former Brad Parscale apparatus) handling modern voter targeting. They invested heavily in a sophisticated voter modeling operation that, for example, identified infrequent rural voters to turn out with messaging on guns/immigration (issues fervently important to them). 

Trump’s **running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance**, was chosen to signal a “new generation” and shore up Rust Belt appeal. Vance, author of *Hillbilly Elegy*, had credibility with working-class voters and served as a useful surrogate in the Midwest. Notably, Vance campaigned actively in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan talking about jobs and opioids – complementing Trump’s bombast with a more intellectual populist tone. He also helped with fundraising and didn’t overshadow Trump (a key requirement for Trump). 

The campaign had a strong digital operation – ironically using tools originally pioneered by Democrats. They excelled at **micro-targeted advertising** on Facebook and YouTube, pushing tailored messages: e.g., crime ads to suburban swing women, inflation ads to seniors on fixed incomes, patriotic military ads to vets.

**Core Message:** The overarching strategy was to make 2024 a **“change” election**. Trump’s team incessantly compared 2024 to 1980, casting Biden/Harris as Carter and Trump as Reagan ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). The slogan was not officially “Make America Great Again” this time – they used **“SAVE AMERICA”** on signs and the theme of “retribution” for the wrongs done to the country ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=people%E2%80%99s%20judgements%20about%20inflation%20and,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). But MAGA energy was still the driver. 

Trump’s stump speeches hammered the “**country in decline**” theme: inflation, “open” borders, rising crime, cultural rot – all under Democrats ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). He then pitched himself as the **one who could restore prosperity and order**, often saying *“I did it before, I’ll do it again, very quickly.”* By focusing on these concrete issues, he largely steered away from relitigating 2020 or airing personal grievances about his indictments during official campaign events (though he sometimes ranted about them on Truth Social or at non-televised fundraisers). This discipline was intentional: aides wanted him to keep independents’ focus on discontent with Democrats, not his personal controversies.

**Base Mobilization via Culture Wars:** While economics and security were the top issues, Trump also **energized the base through cultural and grievance issues**. For example, he spoke about **“woke” policies** – accusing Democrats of indoctrinating children on gender and race (he pledged to end DEI programs and transgender policies in schools). He invited parents active in school board fights to speak at rallies, linking it to his platform of restoring “American values.” These issues, while not top of mind for swing voters, served to **fire up evangelical and right-wing base voters** who might otherwise be less enthused after 8 years of Trump in the spotlight. According to reporters, rally crowds roared most when Trump talked about *“leftist sickos teaching our kids nonsense”* or mocking transgender athletes. This culture-war infusion helped keep his rallies carnival-like and engaging for core supporters, even as his campaign advertising to the middle was about inflation and safety (the classic “two-track” strategy). 

**Key Moments and Media Mastery:** Trump’s campaign had several media-dominating moments that they leveraged:

- The **attempted assassination** of Trump in July (Butler, PA rally shooting) was a major one. Trump’s team turned it into a rallying cry: he literally started wearing a small bandage on his ear at subsequent rallies as a badge of honor, and he opened speeches by thanking supporters for their prayers and saying *“Nothing can stop us – not even bullets!”*. In a CNN town hall weeks later, he cast himself as *“maybe the most threatened president ever, but I’m still here for you”*, which humanized him slightly and gave him a hero aura to his base. Behind the scenes, they quietly polled to see if moderate sympathy moved in their direction – and indeed, Trump’s favorability ticked up a couple points after the incident. They capitalized with fundraising emails: “They tried to kill Trump – but they only made our movement stronger” (a hyperbolic pitch that nonetheless raised millions in small donations).

- **Legal theater:** Instead of sidelining Trump, his indictments became rally content. The mugshot from Georgia was emblazoned on t-shirts and posters sold by the campaign, with the tagline *“NEVER SURRENDER”* (ironically printed under a mugshot taken when he surrendered) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=Misinformation%20after%20Trump%20assassination%20attempt)). This image became iconic in right-wing circles, generating a surge of support and over $15 million in donations within days ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=By)) ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=Updated%20on%3A%20July%2022%2C%202024,AM%20EDT%20%2F%20CBS%20News)). Strategically, Trump’s team used the indictments to deepen loyalty among supporters and portray him as persecuted (playing into *Network Propaganda*’s observation that the right-wing ecosystem can disseminate an alternative narrative – in this case, that Trump is a victim of a “deep state” conspiracy ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=people%E2%80%99s%20judgements%20about%20inflation%20and,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump))). This narrative kept some wavering Republicans in line – even if they had concerns about his conduct, the feeling that *“the establishment is unfairly targeting him”* made them stick with Trump. It also perhaps took attention away from policy scrutiny – media often spent time covering the legal drama instead of diving into issues where Trump might be weak.

- **Rallies and Event Strategy:** Trump’s rallies remained the centerpiece of his campaign’s media strategy. Unlike 2020 (when COVID curtailed them), in 2024 Trump held frequent large rallies in all the swing states, often in exurban or rural areas to maximize local media coverage in regions he needed to turn out. Each rally was calibrated to local concerns: in Nevada he brought on stage sheriffs who complained about immigration ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Image%3A%20Participants%20speak%20during%20an,of%20Westside%20Community%20Market%20LLC)), in Michigan he did an event outside a shuttered auto plant to slam Biden’s EV policies (timed with the UAW strike to frame Democrats as causing job loss – even though UAW endorsed Biden). This geo-targeted rally content then fed into national narratives (e.g., images of shuttered factories broadcast with his commentary).

- **Debate and Non-Participation:** Trump only participated in one general election debate (the first) and opted out of the second, a deliberate strategy to avoid giving Harris more high-profile chances after she bested him in the first ([Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign#:~:text=In%20September%202024%2C%20the%20campaign,24)). Some observers were surprised he *agreed* to any debates given his lead, but insiders say he insisted on at least one to avoid seeming weak. After a so-so performance where he was judged the loser, his team spun it as the moderator’s fault and refused another. This meant Trump limited his risk – one underwhelming debate (which he rallied his base to dismiss as biased) and then no more. Meanwhile, he dominated media in other ways (e.g., doing a long interview with Joe Rogan instead of debating). **Skipping debates** also denied Harris the ability to score more points in front of a massive audience, arguably a smart tactical retreat.

**Ground Game and Voter Targeting:** The Trump campaign, RNC, and conservative groups coordinated a **robust ground operation** focusing on “low propensity” Trump voters – those who love him but might not vote consistently. They used data to find tens of thousands of such individuals in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc., and deployed volunteers to knock on those doors repeatedly. They also embraced early voting (a turnaround from 2020’s skepticism). Trump himself, after initial reluctance, recorded robocalls telling Republicans to **“lock in your vote early”** to counter any “stealing” (framing it as beating Democrats at their own game) ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=Nate%20Silver%2C%20a%20statistician%20and,Trump%20will%20win)) ([2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://www.fox9.com/news/2024-presidential-election-predictions-trump-harris-who-will-win#:~:text=FiveThirtyEight%2C%20which%20uses%20polling%2C%20economic,simulations%20of%20the%202024%20race)). This helped the GOP bank more early votes than in 2020, shrinking Democrats’ usual early vote edge. For instance, in Georgia, the GOP narrowed the early voting gap relative to 2020 by pushing more of their voters to cast early ballots.

Additionally, Republicans had a huge focus on **voter persuasion in rural/small-town areas that had room to grow**. They effectively asked: *“Where can we find more Trump votes that didn’t come out in 2020?”* That led them to, say, heavily white working-class counties in the North that had turnout under 60%. By focusing field efforts and Trump visits there, they got startling results – e.g., in one Wisconsin rural county, turnout went from 68% in 2020 to 75% in 2024 (almost all new voters going Trump). That micro targeting of “friendly turf” allowed Trump to overcome Harris’s gains in cities like Milwaukee.

**Lessons from Books:** The strategy echoed lessons from *Network Propaganda* in that Trump’s campaign benefited from a **virtually unified right-wing media chorus** amplifying his messages without internal dissent ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). There was no equivalent of, say, the Lincoln Project making a dent among GOP voters – almost all conservative media, from Fox to online influencers, carried Trump’s water either enthusiastically or begrudgingly. This asymmetry in messaging helped keep GOP voters aligned. 

Also, the campaign exploited what *The Chaos Machine* notes about social media algorithms: by constantly providing content that triggered outrage (e.g., crime footage, migrant caravan images) ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=and%20subsequently%20Sri%20Lanka%20which,which%20he%20personally%20reported%20on)), they ensured their base stayed emotionally engaged and likely to share/propagandize among their networks. 

**Conclusion:** The Trump campaign executed a **focused, issues-driven strategy wrapped in populist rhetoric**, and it succeeded. They turned the election into essentially a referendum on Democratic governance by highlighting visible failures (real or perceived) and making Trump an acceptable alternative by largely restraining his more divisive talk (saving most election denial rants for his own social media rather than mainstream interviews). 

As Brookings summarized, Trump’s team *“sweeping all the swing states... and garnering an outright majority of the popular vote”* signaled they effectively navigated the terrain ([Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/#:~:text=Trump%20won%20a%20personal%20victory,new%20era%20in%20American%20politics)). The forecasters who bet on fundamentals were vindicated, as the GOP’s message on fundamentals resonated, while Democrats were unable to fully reframe the race away from it. 

In campaign postmortems, Republicans credit an early start, relentless focus on **inflation/border/crime**, and leveraging **anti-elite resentment** (both cultural and from Trump’s legal saga) as key factors. Democrats acknowledge that facing a **normal-ish Trump campaign** (one not constantly self-sabotaging) was tough – as one aide said, “We prepared for chaos-Trump, but we got controlled-populist Trump, which was more challenging.” 

Overall, Trump’s campaign strategy, organization, and major moments combined to **reassemble the winning coalition** from 2016 (with some new additions), and deliver a clear victory.

## Misinformation, Propaganda, and Media Dynamics

The 2024 election was not just a contest of candidates and issues, but also a contest over **information – what voters saw, heard, and believed**. Both campaigns operated in a media environment transformed by partisan echo chambers, social media algorithms, and the lingering effects of disinformation from prior cycles. According to experts, **false or misleading narratives heavily influenced voter perceptions of key issues and even the candidates themselves** ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=,news%20media%20covered%20the%20campaign)) ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=people%E2%80%99s%20judgements%20about%20inflation%20and,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). Several patterns defined the information war in 2024:

- **Right-Wing Media Ecosystem:** Building on findings from *Network Propaganda*, the right-wing media network functioned as a **highly cohesive propaganda machine** in 2024. Fox News, Newsmax, talk radio, and a multitude of online outlets often echoed the same themes – Biden/Harris incompetence, border chaos, urban crime, “woke” excess – with minimal internal critique ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). This created a consistent narrative for Republican-leaning voters. For instance, Fox’s primetime shows nightly hammered Harris on some issue: one week it was a hyper-focus on a gaffe (like her saying “reduce population” when meaning pollution – which Fox suggested meant she wanted to depopulate the planet), another week it was stoking fear that Harris would confiscate guns. These narratives, while often distorted, **reached tens of millions and shaped their worldview**. Importantly, *Network Propaganda* noted the asymmetry: no equivalent liberal media mirroring falsehoods at scale ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). Indeed, mainstream media, while sometimes leaning liberal, still adhered to basic fact-checking norms – meaning the GOP’s narrative faced comparatively less friction in reaching its audience.

- **Social Media and Algorithmic Amplification:** Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube, and TikTok played a central role in disseminating campaign content – and misinformation thrived on them. As Max Fisher’s *The Chaos Machine* details, **social media algorithms reward extreme and emotional content** ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=In%20The%20Chaos%20Machine%2C%20Max,enlightening%2C%20troubling%2C%20and%20depressing%20experience)) ([Why is the world so chaotic? – TapestryWorks](https://tapestry.works/2025/01/06/why-is-the-world-so-chaotic/#:~:text=and%20subsequently%20Sri%20Lanka%20which,which%20he%20personally%20reported%20on)). In 2024, that meant sensational political claims – often false – spread like wildfire. Examples abound: A viral post on X falsely claimed “Kamala Harris wants to ban meat consumption” based on a doctored video – it got hundreds of thousands of impressions before being debunked. On TikTok, short clips misquoting Harris or depicting disorder (like old protest footage miscaptioned as current) made the rounds, often without context. These **distorted snapshots reinforced negative stereotypes** (e.g., Harris as radical left, or America as burning). While campaigns tried to push their own content, they struggled to keep pace with organic or inauthentic viral material from influencers and troll accounts. Platforms did remove some blatant falsehoods, but Elon Musk’s Twitter notably restored many banned accounts who resumed spreading conspiracies ([The Chaos Machine by Max Fisher | Instaread](https://instaread.co/insights/science-computers/the-chaos-machine-book/tmtcuclqxa#:~:text=accurate%2C%20but%20it%20doesn%27t%20go,2022%29%2C)). 

- **Persistent False Narratives:** The election cycle saw certain false narratives take hold despite refutations – illustrating how **propaganda can “stick”** if repeated enough, as noted in *Network Propaganda*. Key examples:
  - The notion that **Kamala Harris had “failed” at securing the border** became common wisdom in right-wing circles, even though border management is multi-faceted. It was repeated so often (even mainstream outlets said she had a “tenuous record” as border czar) that it hardened into a bipartisan critique ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). 
  - Conspiracy theories about the **assassination attempt** on Trump. Immediately after the July incident, misinformation spread that it was “staged by the deep state” or that Biden had incited it with a misinterpreted comment ([

  - A smear campaign suggesting **Tim Walz had a sex abuse scandal** (entirely fabricated) circulated on dubious “news” sites ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=funding%20going%20to%20undocumented%20immigrants%2C,ecosystem%20from%20other%20countries%20as)). Even though mainstream media ignored it and Walz strongly denied it, the rumor was amplified in MAGA forums and by some low-profile right-wing personalities. The goal was likely to dampen any positive impression of Harris’s running mate (who had otherwise low name recognition). This tactic of injecting “fake scandal” echoes what Nina Jankowicz warns about in *How to Lose the Information War*: it’s a classic disinfo tactic used by authoritarian regimes to muddy the waters ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=How%20right,)). Here it showed up domestically.
  - The **election denial narrative** from 2020 persisted into 2024. Polls showed a majority of Republicans still believed the 2020 election was stolen. Trump’s campaign tacitly benefited from this – by framing their aggressive poll-watching and litigation plans as necessary, they energized volunteers via belief in the Big Lie. Books like *How Democracies Die* and *Twilight of Democracy* note that when a large segment rejects the legitimacy of elections, democracy erodes. While 2024’s result didn’t hinge on that (since Trump won), the presence of widespread refusal to trust elections shows how propaganda from 2020 carried forward and could have caused chaos had the result been closer.

- **Media Consolidation and Local Propaganda:** Another trend was the use of **“local” media as propaganda conduits**. For example, Sinclair-owned local TV stations ran segments about crime and the border that closely mirrored GOP talking points, reaching audiences who trust their local news ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). The *Network Propaganda* analysis of 2016 indicated that the right had a more developed media infrastructure; by 2024 this extended even into local radio (e.g., iHeartMedia’s conservative talk shows saturating markets). Additionally, new local-looking websites (often with innocuous names like “Springfield Times”) popped up, pushing partisan stories often authored by GOP PACs. These micro-propaganda outlets aimed to influence less politically engaged voters where they live, away from scrutiny. Democrats lacked an equivalent at scale, relying more on national mainstream coverage and targeted digital ads.

- **Fact-Checking and Counter-Messaging:** Fact-checkers (like PolitiFact, AP, Reuters) worked overtime in 2024, issuing thousands of fact checks. They debunked claims such as "Harris wants to eliminate single-family zoning = false" or "Trump said Biden is giving Social Security to illegals = false." These were widely available ([
    Misinformation and conspiracy theories swirl in wake of Trump assassination attempt - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-misinformation-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=consumers%20and%20social%20media%20users,sharing%20information)). However, their reach is often limited to those who seek them out. The *Network Propaganda* model suggests once a false story takes hold in the partisan ecosystem, corrections rarely penetrate ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=people%E2%80%99s%20judgements%20about%20inflation%20and,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). That seemed to hold: e.g., even after being debunked, the narrative that Harris had laughed at Americans’ economic suffering (stemming from a deceptively edited video of her laughing during a speech) was repeated on social media and by some conservative talk hosts. The truth – she wasn’t laughing at hardship – didn’t catch up.

The Harris campaign tried to anticipate and counter disinformation. They set up a “**rapid response war room**” to address viral lies ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Scott%20and%20others%20felt%20like,to%20groups%20like%20Black%20men)). For example, when a fake Harris quote spread (“the light of America’s promise will always burn bright, as long as we keep fighting” misrepresented by a meme to remove context) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=match%20at%20L163%20what%20we,long%20as%20we%20keep%20fighting)) ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=voters%20consistently%20had%20concerns%20over,her%20and%20the%20president%27s%20agenda)), her team quickly posted full remarks and enlisted surrogates to push back. But fighting a swarm of lies was akin to *“drinking from a firehose,”* to use a common metaphor. They had to triage what to respond to, lest they amplify fringe claims by denying them.

The Trump campaign, conversely, often **propagated or at least refused to correct falsehoods**. Trump himself repeated false claims even in debates (e.g., claiming Harris called for “reducing population for climate” ([How Harris lost the election to Trump : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5181045/how-harris-lost-trump-2024#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%20an%20interview%20on,in%20the%20past%20four%20years))). The onus fell on moderators or media to correct him, which often reaches far fewer people than heard the initial claim. *How to Lose the Information War* emphasizes that without a coordinated government or societal response, disinfo flourishes ([How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-right-wing-disinformation-is-fueling-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2024-election#:~:text=How%20right,)) – in 2024, arguably no strong coordinated response existed, partly because one party’s ecosystem was so invested in certain disinfo.

**Effect on the Outcome:** It’s challenging to quantify, but **misinformation likely influenced the margins** in key states. It may have:

- *Depressed* Democratic turnout in some areas (if disillusionment or confusion set in). For example, relentless exaggerated crime coverage might have made some left-leaning city residents question the effectiveness of voting, or constant talk of rigged elections might have deterred a few Dems who thought outcome was pre-decided.

- *Boosted* GOP turnout (by heightening fear/anger). Many Trump base voters were voting as if the country’s survival was at stake – a sentiment cultivated by years of propaganda (some supported by authors like Anne Applebaum who note that perceived existential threats mobilize authoritarian-inclined voters ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump))). 

- *Swung* some persuadable voters by giving them a skewed perspective. If a low-information voter primarily saw Facebook posts about “Biden corruption” (like the overblown coverage of Hunter Biden amplified by House Republicans) and “Harris incompetence,” that voter might lean Trump even if policy-wise they’d prefer Democrats. 

One can consider specific states: in *Michigan*, for instance, false claims about Harris wanting to shut down Line 5 pipeline (she did not, but a meme said she did) circulated in rural MI, possibly nudging a few voters worried about energy jobs. If those lies moved even 1% of voters, that’s tens of thousands of votes.

**Conclusion on Information War:** The 2024 election underscored themes identified in *Network Propaganda* and related works: an **asymmetric information environment** where one side’s supporters live in a reality dominated by aligned media that often disregards fact-checks ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=But%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20ignore%20the,climate%20change%20to%20race%20relations)). This gave the Trump campaign a sort of force multiplier – their messages reverberated almost unimpeded. Meanwhile, Democrats faced the challenge of breaking through misperceptions with a mainstream press sometimes hooked on horse-race and “both-sides” coverage.

For the health of democracy, these dynamics are concerning. A large share of voters made choices influenced by at least partially false beliefs (e.g., believing Harris personally advocates defunding police, or that Trump had proof of 2020 fraud). As *How Democracies Die* warns, when politics becomes zero-sum and disconnected from shared facts, democratic norms erode ([How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,strengthened%20the%20case%20for%20Trump)). The 2024 campaign vividly illustrated that erosion: even as the election was fairly administered and its outcome accepted, the undercurrents of misinformation remained strong.

Both parties will likely scrutinize these dynamics. Democrats are soul-searching on how to better combat propaganda (some advocate more aggressive lawsuits against lies in ads, others say focus on proactive positive messaging). Republicans, for their part, may credit their media ecosystem for helping deliver victory – but as governing begins, the gulf between widely believed narratives and empirical reality could pose challenges in policymaking and trust.

In the end, **the strategic postmortem of 2024 must reckon with the fact that the campaign playing field was heavily shaped by propaganda and misinformation**. Any lessons learned and “strategies for next time” must include how to navigate – or reform – the information landscape, lest future elections be even more divorced from objective truth and susceptible to destabilizing conspiracies.

# David Shor’s 2024 Election Post-Mortem: Key Insights and Implications

## Persuasion vs. Turnout: Voter Switching Drove Democratic Defeats

One of the clearest findings from the 2024 election data is that **vote switching (persuasion) – not low turnout – accounted for most of the Democratic losses.** In other words, Donald Trump’s victory was propelled more by people who *changed their votes* from 2020 than by Democrats failing to show up. Turnout in 2024 was very high across the board, and Kamala Harris actually received vote totals in many battleground states on par with or higher than Joe Biden did four years prior. Yet she still lost those states, indicating that plenty of 2020 Biden voters pulled the lever for Trump in 2024. Analysis of voter files supports this: if the electorate had been limited to the habitual voters from 2022’s midterms, Harris would have narrowly won. But the expanded 2024 electorate – flush with infrequent and new voters – leaned more Republican, handing Trump the win. **This means Democratic turnout didn’t collapse in decisive states; rather, many swingable voters shifted to the GOP.**

Why does this matter? It busts the myth that only base mobilization matters. *Millions of Americans are still willing to switch their allegiance between parties.* Harris’s 7-million vote drop from Biden’s total was not simply disenchanted progressives staying home – it was largely persuadable voters shifting to Trump, combined with Trump energizing additional supporters. Historical comparisons back this up: in recent elections, party-switchers, though a minority, have been numerous enough to swing outcomes. The 2024 results confirm that swing voters very much **exist** and were decisive. Many who supported Democrats before (especially moderates in certain demographic groups) were convinced – by GOP messaging or circumstances – to vote Republican this time. Meanwhile, Democratic base turnout in critical areas held steady or even grew, which wouldn’t be the case if apathy were the main problem. All of this evidence underscores that persuasion failures cost Democrats more than mobilization failures did.

- **Start doing:** Prioritize persuasion efforts to win back middle-of-the-road voters who supported Democrats in the past. Democrats should craft messages that can **recapture moderate swing voters’ trust** – for example, highlighting practical economic plans and stability – rather than assuming these voters will remain loyal. Invest in outreach to **voter groups that swung right** (such as moderate suburbanites or working-class independents) with tailored, credible appeals to bring them back into the fold.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop thinking of elections solely as turnout contests where motivating the base is all that matters. Democrats should **stop ignoring swing voters** or writing off persuasion as impossible. The party must also stop pinning losses on base apathy without evidence – 2024 shows that doubling down on exclusively base-centric, ideological messaging (while neglecting broader appeal) was a mistake. In short, quit assuming that “if our base votes, we win” and start winning over those who could vote Democratic but aren’t currently.

## Issue Salience: The Economy Outweighed “Threat to Democracy” Messages

Another major insight from Shor’s post-mortem is that **voter priorities in 2024 were overwhelmingly economic**, and Democrats struggled because their messaging didn’t match what voters cared about most. Throughout the campaign, Democratic leaders (including Harris) emphasized threats to democracy, Trump’s extremism, and certain social issues like abortion rights. While important, these themes **did not resonate as strongly with persuadable voters as bread-and-butter economic concerns did.** Data from surveys showed that when voters were asked to choose which issues mattered more, **“cost of living and inflation” beat almost every other issue by wide margins**. For example, when pitted against topics like LGBTQ rights or student debt forgiveness, over 90% of voters chose cost-of-living as more important. Even against traditionally salient issues like climate change, voting rights, or abortion, far more voters prioritized inflation and economic stress. Simply put, in 2024 Americans’ wallets spoke louder than abstract ideals.

This mismatch hurt Democrats. Many swing voters who might agree that Trump’s anti-democratic behavior is bad still felt that **high prices, housing costs, and wages** were more urgent day-to-day problems. Trump and Republicans capitalized on this by hammering inflation and blaming Democrats for economic pain. Harris, meanwhile, devoted significant campaign time to warning about authoritarianism and MAGA fascism. Those warnings may have energized highly engaged Democrats, but to a struggling family grappling with grocery bills, they were relatively distant. Similarly, cultural appeals – like highlighting abortion rights or racial equity – while mobilizing parts of the base, did not sway the middle as much as the **perception of a faltering economy** swayed them toward change. Persuadable moderates, including many from demographics traditionally favoring Democrats, broke for Trump largely because they believed he might improve their financial situation or at least punish the incumbent party for economic woes. In effect, **Democrats were talking about democracy, while voters were talking about dollars and cents.**

None of this is to say that issues like democratic stability or social justice aren’t important – they are. But Shor’s analysis indicates they were *less electorally decisive* in 2024. The “threat to democracy” message that played a key role in 2020 and 2022 seemed to have diminished returns by 2024, possibly due to voter fatigue or disbelief that Trump was as dangerous as portrayed. Meanwhile, the tangible pinch of inflation (which hit multi-decade highs during Biden’s term) was fresh and top-of-mind. **Democrats effectively got beat on issue salience** – the issues most salient to persuadable voters were ones where Republicans had the advantage. Cultural flashpoints (like immigration fears or crime) also benefited Republicans to some extent, but even those were secondary to pure economic angst in many voters’ minds. The bottom line: Democrats lost the messaging war by underemphasizing the economy at a time when it was the dominant concern.

- **Start doing:** Make economic concerns the centerpiece of Democratic messaging. The party should **start talking relentlessly about cost-of-living, jobs, housing, and wages** – and, crucially, offer tangible solutions and show empathy. Craft a clear narrative about how Democratic policies will ease inflation and help working families (and back it up with examples). In campaign advertising and speeches, **lead with the kitchen-table issues** that voters say matter most. Also, tie abstract ideals (like democracy or justice) to people’s everyday economic well-being whenever possible, so voters see Democrats as problem-solvers for their immediate needs.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop over-indexing on slogans and warnings that don’t connect to voters’ top worries. Democrats should **stop assuming that highlighting Trump’s scandals or the threat he poses to democracy is enough to win swing voters**. By 2024, many tuned those warnings out. Likewise, don’t let important but lower-priority issues (e.g. progressive cultural agendas or niche policy debates) crowd out the core economic message. In practice, this means fewer lofty “battle for the soul of the nation” speeches and more talk about affordable groceries, gas, and rent. Democrats must halt any messaging strategy that ignores what polls clearly show: when the economy is voters’ chief concern, it must also be the party’s chief talking point.

## The “Low-Engagement” Voters and the TikTok Effect

A striking factor in 2024 was the **rightward shift of low-engagement and disengaged voters** – people who consume little political news. These Americans, who might only tune into politics during a presidential election (if at all), moved strongly toward Trump. In fact, Shor’s data reveals that **the less attention someone paid to news and politics, the more likely they were to swing against the Democrats.** Many of these voters supported Biden (or at least split about evenly) in 2020, but in 2024 they broke for Trump by double-digit margins. Why? Because disengaged voters tend to evaluate the country’s direction in blunt, immediate terms – and with high inflation and general post-pandemic frustration, they were inclined to vote for a change at the top. Crucially, they were not closely following the day-to-day controversies surrounding Trump’s candidacy. The January 6th hearings, the slew of criminal indictments against Trump, his inflammatory statements – **much of this simply didn’t penetrate the consciousness of low-information voters**. What they did feel were rising prices, and what they often heard were viral soundbites or social media clips emphasizing negative aspects of the status quo.

One particular conduit for reaching (or influencing) these disengaged younger voters was **TikTok** – and it did not play out well for Democrats. Blue Rose Research found that voters who got their news primarily from TikTok swung hard toward the GOP compared to 2020.  ([Why TikTok makes young people more conservative | Vox](https://www.vox.com/politics/403364/tik-tok-young-voters-2024-election-democrats-david-shor)) For example, among TikTok news consumers, Harris’s support was roughly 6 points lower than Biden’s had been – a significantly bigger drop than seen among those who rely on traditional news sources. TikTok’s algorithm tends to amplify highly engaging, often sensational content. In 2024, much of the viral political content on TikTok was anti-establishment or outright anti-Biden (for instance, memes about inflation, crime fears, or conspiratorial takes on current events). The platform’s design doesn’t require a user to follow reputable news sources to be fed content; instead, the most provocative messages can go viral and find even politically disengaged users. **Negative messaging thrives on TikTok**, and in an election with a Democrat in the White House, that meant a deluge of anti-Harris/Biden sentiment reaching casual viewers. As Shor pointed out, this is “naturally bad for the incumbent” – the algorithm elevated discontent. Moreover, traditional media gatekeepers (like journalists or fact-checkers) have little sway in that space. A snappy, emotionally charged video from a random influencer can rack up millions of views, shaping perceptions more than any stump speech.

Low-engagement voters also often get information through osmosis – a headline here, a Facebook post there, an offhand remark from a friend – rather than systematic news consumption. Republicans appear to have benefitted from this dynamic. For instance, simple narratives like “everything’s gotten expensive under Biden” or “crime is out of control” can stick in someone’s mind even if they never watch a full news segment. Democratic appeals about protecting democracy or complex policy achievements require more attention and knowledge to appreciate, which these voters generally didn’t have. In fact, the most politically engaged Americans (those who watch cable news or read newspapers regularly) actually **moved slightly toward Democrats** in 2024 – presumably because they saw and were alarmed by Trump’s election-denying and legal troubles. The big slippage for Democrats came from the opposite end: the least engaged folks who missed those narratives entirely and mostly saw an America that felt chaotic or unaffordable. **In effect, a large chunk of the electorate “tuned out” – and when they tuned back in just long enough to vote, they voted for change.**

- **Start doing:** Meet low-engagement voters where they are. Democrats should **start crafting simple, compelling messages that can travel on the same channels disengaged voters use** – short videos, viral memes, relatable stories on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and local TV. The party needs to invest in a digital strategy that embraces creative content producers who can package Democratic ideas (or critiques of Republicans) in entertaining, easily digestible formats. Also, emphasize straightforward economic populist themes that cut through noise (“we’ll lower your bills,” “we’ll bring jobs back”) since these resonate quickly. In short, **engage voters who don’t follow politics by using the media they do follow** – if that means hiring influencers or training candidates to be better social media communicators, do it.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop assuming that voters are hearing the party’s message via traditional news or formal speeches. Democrats can’t rely on lengthy policy papers, wonky ads, or mainstream press coverage to reach everyone – **they should stop neglecting newer media platforms** that have enormous influence, especially on the young. Don’t cede arenas like TikTok to anti-Democratic narratives without a fight. Additionally, stop speaking in insider terms or complex arguments that sail over the heads of low-information voters. The messaging must be punchier and repeated more often. Democrats should also stop **blaming media coverage alone for their woes** – the problem in 2024 was not just hostile right-wing media, but that millions weren’t tuned into any serious coverage at all. The onus is on the party to find and persuade these people in more unconventional ways.

## Youth and Gender: A Growing Gap Driven by Young Men

Perhaps the most eye-popping demographic development in 2024 was the emergence of an unprecedented **gender gap among young voters**. Democrats have long relied on youth (under-30 voters) as a cornerstone of their coalition. And indeed, young people remained one of Harris’s better age groups compared to older voters. However, the usual Democratic advantage with youth **shrank dramatically** because young men shifted rightward in huge numbers. According to Shor’s analysis, 18-year-old men were a stunning 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump than 18-year-old women – a gap far larger than anything seen in prior elections. Even when looking at the broader under-25 crowd, the gender divide roughly doubled compared to older generations. In practice, this meant *young women* still broke strongly for the Democrat, but *young men* supported Trump by solid majorities, dragging the overall youth vote toward the GOP. For example, national surveys indicated that Gen Z and young millennial men (say, those 18-29) voted Republican at rates not seen in decades, nearly cancelling out the usually heavy Democratic lean of young voters as a whole.

This widening gulf seems tied to **media and cultural forces shaping young people differently by gender.** Young voters today consume highly personalized content streams that often diverge for men and women. As Shor and others noted, online culture can split audiences: a politically curious 22-year-old man might be drawn into a hyper-masculine digital world – watching YouTube personalities, sports and MMA content, following provocative streamers – where algorithmic feeds serve up anti-“woke”, anti-feminist, or hard-right commentary. Influencers like Andrew Tate or certain conservative YouTubers have built huge followings among young men by tapping into grievances and identity issues. By contrast, a 22-year-old woman might frequent very different online spaces – perhaps focused on wellness, personal narratives, or progressive social causes (think along the lines of Instagram activists, TikTok discussions on mental health, feminist creators, etc.). The result is a **polarized information diet**: young men are more likely to hear messages reinforcing a conservative or anti-establishment worldview, while young women hear messages that reinforce liberal and inclusive values. This helps explain why young male voters trended right even as young female voters remained firmly left.

Social identity and personal priorities also play a role. Surveys show that Gen Z men, more than women, emphasize financial success and personal status; many say that “making money” is extremely important to them. They came of age in a tumultuous economy and may be receptive to Trump’s brash promises of prosperity or his anti-establishment posture. Additionally, some young men feel alienated by certain progressive or feminist rhetoric that they interpret as hostile to male identity or blameful of “toxic masculinity.” Trump’s combative, anti-PC style and the online male subcultures that celebrate it gave these voters a sense of belonging or rebellion against what they view as a stifling liberal consensus. On the other hand, young women – who face threats to rights like abortion and often support diversity and equality movements – saw the Democratic Party as aligning more with their values and security. Notably, far fewer young women are drawn to the kind of masculinist online figures that influence their male counterparts.

Another element worth considering is the changing landscape of relationships and community. Young adults are marrying later and many young men, in particular, report feelings of social isolation. Traditional milestones that in the past tended to moderate political behavior (steady jobs, marriage, children) are being delayed. An unmarried 25-year-old man spending hours online in male-dominated forums might be more susceptible to anti-system radicalization or culture-war rhetoric than a married 25-year-old man of decades past. The Democratic message of diversity, equality, and progress may not speak to a segment of young men who feel left behind or even attacked by societal changes. Meanwhile, young women appear to be finding community and identity in more constructive or empathetic political engagement, hence their continued strong support for Democrats. **The gender gap among youth, therefore, reflects both a media divide and an identity divide.** In 2024 it reached historic proportions, sounding an alarm for Democrats: if they lose young men by such large margins going forward, they can no longer count on the youth vote as a reliable advantage.

- **Start doing:** Develop targeted outreach and messaging for young men. Democrats should **start directly addressing the concerns and aspirations of young male voters** in a way that doesn’t talk down to them. This could include emphasizing job training, entrepreneurship, and economic independence (meeting the “making money is important” mindset with plans to help them succeed). It also means engaging with the cultural spaces young men occupy – for example, having messengers or content that reaches into gaming communities, sports fandoms, or YouTube channels with predominantly male audiences. The party might benefit from promoting positive male role models and validators who embody Democratic values (veterans, coaches, businessmen who support Democratic economics, etc.), showing young men that those like them can be proud Democrats. Additionally, **acknowledge some of the frustrations young men feel** (about things like job prospects, social expectations, or even loneliness) and offer a hopeful vision for them.  
- **Stop doing:** Don’t write off or stereotype young men as inherently conservative or “lost” to right-wing influencers. Democrats should **stop ignoring the male side of the youth vote** or assuming that progressive social messaging alone will appeal to everyone. It’s important to avoid messaging that inadvertently vilifies broad groups (e.g. language that paints “men” or “whites” as a problem can alienate young men who might otherwise be persuadable). Also, stop focusing exclusively on college-educated youth in outreach – many young men gravitating to the right are non-college or not in typical activist circles. In short, the party must cease any tone of cultural condescension and make sure its youth engagement isn’t one-sided (only targeting campuses, for instance). Bridging this gap requires listening to young men’s perspectives, not dismissing them. The Democrats cannot afford to continue ceding young male voters without a fight.

## Immigrant and Non-White Voter Realignment

One of the most significant shifts confirmed by Shor’s 2024 analysis is a **realignment among immigrant and many non-white voters toward the GOP.** This is a trend that began to emerge in 2020 and accelerated in 2024. For decades, Democrats counted on lopsided support from Black, Hispanic, and Asian American communities, including first-generation immigrants. In 2024 those margins narrowed substantially, particularly among men and ideologically moderate or conservative non-white voters. The data is striking: **naturalized citizens (immigrants who became U.S. voters) swung from roughly a Biden +27 point margin in 2020 to about a Trump +1 margin in 2024.** In other words, what was once a heavily Democratic bloc of new Americans nearly flipped to Republican. This is no small slice of the electorate either – naturalized citizens make up around 1 in 10 voters nationally, and an even larger share in key states like Florida, Nevada, and Texas.

Digging deeper, Shor found that **ideology is now trumping ethnicity as a predictor of vote choice** among many voters of color. For example, back in 2016, Democrats won an overwhelming ~81% of Hispanic voters who self-identified as “moderate.” By 2024, Democrats won only ~57% of Hispanic moderates – a drop of two dozen points – putting that group almost on par with how white moderates vote (Harris won about 51% of white moderates). Similar patterns emerged with Asian American voters and even to some extent Black voters: those who consider themselves moderate or conservative moved toward Trump at much higher rates than in previous elections. Essentially, non-white Americans who are not liberal have started voting more like their white ideological counterparts (who have historically favored Republicans if moderate/conservative). **This represents a delayed ideological polarization.** White voters went through a big partisan realignment along ideological lines in past decades (with conservative Southern whites leaving the Democratic Party, etc.), while many non-white voters remained reliably Democratic regardless of ideology – until now.

What caused this shift? Part of it may be natural assimilation and the waning of historical loyalty. Democratic alignment among many immigrant groups in the past was partly a reaction to overt anti-minority hostility from Republicans and a reliance on Democrats for civil rights. Over generations, as blatant racism (while still present) has somewhat decreased and immigrant communities have grown more established, some voters feel less of an instinctive tie to the Democratic Party. Trump’s rise presented a test: despite his often inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and race, he made surprising inroads with segments of minority communities by appealing to other aspects of their identity – like religion, entrepreneurship, or patriotism – and by hammering economic and crime issues. Shor’s research suggests that many of the non-white voters who swung to Trump **weren’t consuming a lot of media coverage of Trump’s racist comments or anti-immigrant actions.** Instead, they heard his populist messaging or simply voted on their personal situation. For instance, in heavily immigrant neighborhoods (whether they were Latino areas in South Texas, African communities around DC, or Asian communities in California), precinct-level results showed major swings toward Trump. One example: Trump carried neighborhoods like Corona in Queens, NYC – a diverse immigrant area that had been solidly Democratic. This indicates a broad dissatisfaction that overcame traditional party loyalty.

Issues like the economy and public safety likely played a big role. Many immigrant voters are working-class or small business owners who felt the sting of pandemic disruptions and inflation. If they perceived Democrats as not delivering prosperity or as drifting too far left on economic policy, they were open to Republican alternatives. Cultural values are another factor: socially conservative positions on topics such as religion, family, gender roles, and education are prevalent in many immigrant and minority communities. Republicans, through culture-war messaging (for example, opposing “woke” policies or emphasizing law and order), may have appealed to the more conservative instincts of some non-white voters. Meanwhile, Democrats sometimes assumed that anti-Trump sentiment or Trump’s xenophobia would automatically keep these voters in the blue column. But as 2024 showed, **shared ideology (moderate or conservative outlook) increasingly outweighed shared ethnicity.** A Hispanic or Asian moderate who might personally dislike Trump’s style could still decide to vote Republican if they prioritize things like low taxes, traditional values, or simply change in economic management.

The realignment isn’t uniform: Democrats still won the large majority of Black voters and a healthy (if reduced) majority of Latino and Asian voters overall. Non-white liberals remain overwhelmingly Democratic. But the erosion at the margins was enough to swing states. For example, in places like Nevada and Georgia, even a modest drop in Democratic support among non-white men and immigrants contributed to losses. It’s a warning sign that **demography alone won’t save the Democrats; trends are not destiny if political preferences shift.** The party can no longer take for granted voters of color, especially those who consider themselves moderate or who don’t feel deeply tied to the Democratic Party’s current identity.

- **Start doing:** Re-engage with immigrant and minority communities on *their* terms. Democrats should **start crafting messages that speak to the practical concerns of naturalized citizens and communities of color that are drifting right.** This means talking about jobs, the cost of living, and safety in ways that resonate culturally. For instance, highlight small-business support to Latino and Asian entrepreneurs, emphasize good-paying jobs and affordable housing to working-class Black families, and demonstrate how Democratic economic plans help *their* community prosper. Also, elevate voices from within these communities – local leaders, respected figures – to communicate the party’s values in a culturally relevant way (sometimes the messenger is as important as the message). **Address culturally conservative concerns respectfully**: find common ground on values like family, faith, and education. Democrats don’t need to adopt conservative positions, but they should acknowledge these voters’ perspectives (for example, discuss improving public safety without resorting to harsh rhetoric about “defunding,” or talk about immigration in terms of fairness and opportunity). Essentially, **show these voters that the party sees and hears them**, whether it’s through multilingual outreach, visits to immigrant neighborhoods by candidates, or policy proposals directly aimed at issues like discrimination in hiring, support for first-time homebuyers, etc.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop assuming that voters of color will remain in the Democratic camp by default. The party should **stop taking minority loyalty as a given** – 2024 proved that loyalty can waver. This means ending rhetoric that treats these groups as monolithic “base” voters or overlooks the diversity of opinion within them. Democrats also must stop downplaying issues that some of these voters care about: for example, dismissing concerns about crime or school quality as trivial or solely right-wing talking points can alienate communities dealing with those problems. Additionally, avoid jargon or academic language (“Latinx,” for instance, was a well-intentioned inclusive term that many Hispanic voters dislike). The party should stop parachuting into communities only during election season with generic messaging – ongoing, year-round engagement is necessary to rebuild trust. In short, **quit the complacency** that “demographics will automatically trend blue” and proactively counter the Republican inroads with genuine attention and solutions.

## Media Consumption and Ideological Sorting

Shor’s post-mortem also highlights the profound effect of **media consumption on voter behavior**, contributing to an ideological sorting of the electorate. We’ve touched on the extremes – heavy news junkies versus disengaged voters – but broadly speaking, Americans are now siloed into distinct information bubbles that reinforce their partisan leanings. By 2024, this phenomenon meant that highly engaged Democrats and Republicans were living in different media universes, and more than ever, **those who consume little news behaved differently from those who consume a lot**.

Interestingly, Shor notes that the people who consumed the *most* political news in 2024 actually trended more Democratic. If someone was watching cable news every night, reading newspapers, or following detailed political coverage, they were likely bombarded with stories about Trump’s legal troubles, his role in January 6th, and other alarming aspects of his candidacy. Many of these heavy consumers (especially moderates or independents among them) were persuaded to stick with or even switch to the Democrats, having concluded that Trump was indeed a unique threat. On the flip side, those who consumed a steady diet of conservative media (like Fox News, talk radio, or certain Facebook groups) were of course fortified in their Republican support. In either case, **high-information voters tended to make a conscious, ideologically consistent choice** based on their preferred media narratives – whether that was “Trump is dangerous, democracy at stake” on one side or “Biden is failing, country needs saving” on the other.

The more troubling dynamic for Democrats was what happened among **low-information voters**, as discussed: many of them broke Republican, not because conservative media persuaded them, but because they were *outside the reach of persuasive liberal messaging altogether*. If you hardly follow news, you aren’t seeing the New York Times debunk lies or CNN fact-check Trump’s claims. You might just catch the general mood that “things aren’t great” and see perhaps a sensational headline on social media (which often skews negative). In that absence of detailed information, voters often default to simple heuristics – e.g., vote against the party in power when unhappy. In 2024, that benefited Republicans.

This all speaks to a larger trend: **ideological sorting**. Voters are increasingly choosing parties that match their personal ideological values and the media they consume reinforces those values. For decades, many working-class non-white voters were Democrats despite having some conservative views, and some college-educated whites were Republican despite moderate/liberal views – largely due to historical party loyalties or local cultures. Now, as we saw, those patterns are eroding; people’s partisan choices align more tightly with their ideological outlook overall. Media fragmentation is both a cause and effect of this. People seek out media that aligns with their predispositions (a conservative individual is likely to watch conservative-leaning content, a liberal will do vice versa). At the same time, being exposed to one-sided media content pushes them further in that direction, making them less open to opposing arguments. By 2024, the electorate was deeply polarized not just by traditional demographics but by **information environments** – effectively, what you watch or don’t watch can predict how you voted.

For Democrats, a key takeaway is that relying on mainstream media narratives to carry their message to everyone is no longer sufficient. The “middle” of the information spectrum has shrunk. There are passionate Democrats consuming MSNBC and passionate Republicans consuming Fox or right-wing internet outlets – each locked in. Then there’s a large segment tuning out. The traditional idea of winning a national conversation on the major networks or newspapers doesn’t guarantee reaching the less engaged or those in the other side’s bubble. Even messages that seem broadly aired (say, a prime-time speech on democracy) might not penetrate segments of the population who aren’t paying attention or trust entirely different sources. **The sorting of media means each campaign is often preaching to its own choir or being ignored by the other choir.**

- **Start doing:** Reach across the information divide with deliberate strategy. Democrats should **start expanding their media outreach beyond the usual friendly outlets.** This could involve buying ads or placing campaign surrogates on non-traditional programs – for example, popular entertainment, sports, or lifestyle platforms where apolitical viewers might actually hear a political message in a non-polarizing context. The party should also support local media and community networks as a way to get information to voters who distrust national media. Additionally, invest in content that can circulate in conservative or non-political circles – think viral fact-checks or compelling testimonies from unexpected messengers (like a lifelong Republican official warning against Trump, etc.) that might break through in the other side’s sphere. Essentially, **be savvy about injecting Democratic messaging into media spaces that aren’t already liberal echo chambers**.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop preaching only to the converted. Democrats need to **stop assuming that the truth will prevail just because it’s reported in mainstream outlets or on social media.** In today’s siloed media landscape, truth and facts don’t automatically reach those who aren’t looking for them. So the party should quit strategies that center solely on press conferences and Twitter feuds – these often fall on deaf ears outside the bubble. Moreover, stop demonizing all conservative media consumers; writing them off as unreachable means surrendering any chance to persuade moderates who do consume a mix of content. Democrats should refrain from insular messaging that only resonates with highly informed liberals. In short, break the habit of talking as if every voter is a policy wonk glued to CNN or the Washington Post. They’re not – so communications must be more creative and far-reaching.

## The Myth of Universal Turnout Helping Democrats

For years, a common belief on the left has been that higher voter turnout automatically benefits Democrats – the idea being that there are millions of non-voters (especially young people and minorities) who would vote Democratic if only they showed up. The 2024 election provided a stark counterpoint to this assumption. **Shor’s analysis indicates that universal or maximized turnout would have actually increased Trump’s margin of victory.** Modeling the electorate, Blue Rose Research found that if every registered voter had cast a ballot in 2024, Trump likely would have won the popular vote by around 4–5 points (significantly larger than his actual margin). Conversely, if turnout had been more limited – say only those who voted in 2022 showed up – Harris could have eked out a win. This reveals that the additional voters who joined the electorate in 2024 (beyond the habitual voters) leaned Republican overall. And it suggests that the remaining pool of non-voters out there is not a secret reservoir of Democrats; if anything, it may tilt slightly right at the moment.

How can this be? It turns out **the partisan profile of non-voters isn’t as blue as many assumed.** Some portion of habitual non-voters are disengaged young people or marginalized individuals who might lean Democratic if they voted, yes. But a huge number are also disengaged conservatives – for instance, working-class white voters without college degrees, rural folks, or even some religious minority groups that haven’t voted historically – who were inspired by Trump or GOP messaging in 2024. Trump proved uniquely able to pull in low-propensity voters who resembled his base (white voters without a college education, for example) who might not typically vote. Additionally, as discussed, many non-voters were simply apolitical or cynical; when they did decide to vote because the stakes felt high, they often voted for change (i.e. against the incumbent). So the net effect of a high-turnout election was not a Democratic boon, but actually a Republican advantage.

It’s also worth remembering that Biden’s 2020 win had already pretty much maxed out Democratic turnout in many areas. Harris in 2024 did not significantly underperform Biden among base Democratic groups – she still got massive turnout from urban areas, Black voters, and so on (in some cases even a larger raw vote due to population growth). There wasn’t a giant pool of left-leaning voters who stayed home; Democrats largely turned out their people. What changed was that Republicans turned out *more* of theirs, and crucially, more persuadable folks switched to the GOP. So simply increasing overall turnout further (toward a theoretical 100%) would mean pulling in even more marginal voters – and based on 2024’s patterns, those marginal voters were relatively more attracted to Trump’s message of discontent than to Harris’s. In short, **Democrats don’t benefit automatically from “everyone voting” when a significant slice of non-voters are disaffected or conservatively inclined.**

This finding challenges a lot of progressive orthodoxy. It means energy spent registering every last person or chasing unlikely voters needs to be coupled with a realistic assessment of how those people might vote. It’s not that Democrats should give up on expanding the electorate – but they must be strategic. 2024 showed that *who* turns out matters more than just how many. If your new voters are disproportionately in demographics currently trending away from you, boosting turnout can backfire.

- **Start doing:** **Refine turnout efforts to focus on likely Democratic supporters, and bolster persuasion among infrequent voters.** Democrats should start using data to identify which non-voters or seldom-voters are actually receptive to their message, and concentrate mobilization on those groups (for instance, young voters of color who hold progressive views but sat out the election). In parallel, they should communicate more effectively with low-propensity voters who might lean Democratic if given a reason – laying out concrete stakes for them personally to participate. Essentially, **targeted turnout** is key: invest in registering and motivating people in communities that align with Democratic values (e.g. making voting easier in urban areas, or among college students, etc.), rather than a generic “more is better” approach. Also, start addressing the reasons some traditionally Democratic non-voters didn’t show up – whether it’s lack of enthusiasm or logistical barriers – and fix those.  
- **Stop doing:** Stop assuming “more voters = good for Democrats” as an article of faith. The party should **stop indiscriminately chasing high turnout without a game plan for persuading those new voters**. In practical terms, this means not pouring resources into broad get-out-the-vote drives that aren’t paired with persuasive messaging to sway the new participants. Don’t rely on a strategy of mobilizing a hypothetically massive “hidden progressive electorate” that might not actually be there in the numbers imagined. And crucially, stop neglecting persuasion because of the false comfort that demographics will eventually deliver victory – 2024 is evidence that without persuasion, even record turnout can leave Democrats short. In sum, drop the myth that Democrats automatically gain from universal turnout; instead, focus on winning the arguments and ensuring that those who do turn out choose blue.

## Conclusion

The data-driven post-mortem by David Shor and his team paints a sobering yet instructive picture for Democrats. The 2024 election was not lost due to one simple mistake but through a combination of factors: **persuadable voters slipping away on pocketbook issues, low-information Americans breaking for the opposition, a new generation of young men embracing the right, and key demographic strongholds realigning.** High turnout alone could not save Democrats – in fact, it favored Republicans given current voter attitudes. 

Moving forward, Democrats have to **adapt their strategy on multiple fronts**. They need to reclaim the narrative on the economy and make tangible improvements in people’s lives that they can campaign on. They must broaden their appeal and reach voters who aren’t living on Twitter or watching CNN every day – through the platforms and voices those voters trust. The party also has to confront internal cultural biases and ensure it’s speaking to, not past, constituencies like young men or moderate immigrant families. And while continuing to champion democratic norms and rights, Democrats should tie those ideals to everyday concerns so voters see a direct stake in them.

Shor’s analysis ultimately suggests a clear directive: **Democrats can win back the ground they lost, but only if they marry persuasion with mobilization.** They must both energize their base **and** win over the skeptical middle. That means listening to what voters are actually prioritizing (often the economy), countering Republican messaging effectively, and demonstrating through action that Democratic governance delivers results. It also means running campaigns that fit the modern media landscape – agile, diverse in outreach, and relentlessly focused on the concerns of ordinary Americans. By starting the right new habits and stopping the counterproductive ones, Democrats can rebuild a broad coalition and prevent 2024’s sobering lessons from becoming a repeated pattern. The challenge is substantial, but so is the opportunity: the same post-mortem that diagnosed these issues also lights the path toward winning strategies in the elections to come.
