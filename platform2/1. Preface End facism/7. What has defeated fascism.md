## 2. Permanent Structures for Enduring Community Engagement
Permanent structures serve as a foundation for sustained community engagement, extending beyond isolated events or single-issue campaigns. They offer continuity and provide a framework for long-term interaction and resilience. The following are various forms such structures might take:

### Community Councils
- **Advisory Councils:** Bodies that provide strategic perspectives by linking community needs with potential policy responses. They often serve as intermediaries between grassroots initiatives and broader governance structures.

### Neighborhood Assemblies
- **Regular Assemblies:** Scheduled gatherings where community members review local challenges, exchange updates, and discuss prospective actions, thereby sustaining engagement over time.
- **Open Forums:** Inclusive meetings designed to solicit diverse perspectives, ensuring that community voices remain integral to the ongoing dialogue.

### Other Sustainable Structures
- **Local Hubs and Resource Centers:** Physical spaces that act as meeting places, information centers, and logistical bases, reinforcing community resilience.
