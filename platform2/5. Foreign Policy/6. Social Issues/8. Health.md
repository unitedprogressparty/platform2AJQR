## Promoting Health as a Human Right and Global Public Good

Global health challenges—including infectious disease outbreaks, pandemics, chronic non-communicable diseases, maternal and child mortality, and health inequities—transcend borders and impact international security, economic development, and human well-being. Investing in global health is not only a moral imperative but also essential for protecting U.S. health security and promoting a more stable and prosperous world.

Our platform advocates for robust U.S. leadership and investment in global health. We support strengthening international cooperation, building resilient health systems worldwide, ensuring equitable access to essential health services and technologies, and addressing the social determinants that drive health disparities.

### Key Strategies for Advancing Global Health:

1.  **Strengthen Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness:**
    *   Increase U.S. funding and support for global disease surveillance networks, rapid response capabilities, and the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency preparedness functions. (See also Domestic Agenda section 6.2).
    *   Invest in research and development for vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for pandemic threats and neglected tropical diseases.
    *   Promote international agreements on data sharing, transparency, and coordinated response during public health emergencies.

2.  **Invest in Strengthening Health Systems Globally:**
    *   Increase U.S. development assistance focused on building resilient and equitable health systems in low- and middle-income countries. This includes support for primary healthcare, health workforce training and retention, supply chain management for medicines and commodities, and health information systems.
    *   Support efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) globally, ensuring everyone can access essential health services without financial hardship.

3.  **Combat Major Infectious Diseases:**
    *   Maintain strong U.S. commitment and funding for global initiatives combating HIV/AIDS (e.g., PEPFAR), tuberculosis, and malaria (e.g., the Global Fund).
    *   Support global vaccination programs (e.g., Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance) to increase immunization coverage worldwide and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

4.  **Improve Maternal, Child, and Reproductive Health:**
    *   Increase investment in global programs aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality, improving access to voluntary family planning and reproductive healthcare services, and promoting adolescent health. (See also section 6.6 Demographic Trends).

5.  **Address Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**
    *   Support global efforts to address the rising burden of NCDs (like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases) through prevention strategies (tobacco control, healthy diets, physical activity) and strengthening health systems to manage chronic conditions.

6.  **Promote Health Equity and Address Social Determinants:**
    *   Ensure U.S. global health programs prioritize reaching the most vulnerable and marginalized populations and address health disparities based on gender, income, ethnicity, geography, and other factors. (See also section 6.13 Health Disparities).
    *   Support multi-sectoral approaches that address the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health (e.g., poverty, education, clean water, nutrition).

### Conclusion:

Investing in global health is an investment in shared security, prosperity, and humanity. By strengthening global health security, supporting resilient health systems, combating major diseases, promoting maternal and child health, and advancing health equity, the United States can lead efforts to create a healthier world for all. This commitment reflects American values and is essential for addressing transnational threats and building a more stable international order.
