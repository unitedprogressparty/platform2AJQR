## Towards a Safe, Orderly, and Rights-Based Approach to Global Migration

International migration is a complex global phenomenon driven by diverse factors, including economic inequality, conflict, persecution, environmental degradation, and climate change. While migration can bring significant benefits to both migrants and host countries, it also presents challenges related to border management, social integration, protection of vulnerable individuals, and addressing the root causes of displacement. A purely restrictive or enforcement-focused approach is often inhumane and ineffective.

Our platform advocates for a U.S. foreign policy that promotes a safe, orderly, and rights-based approach to global migration. This requires international cooperation, addressing the drivers of forced migration, upholding the rights of migrants and refugees under international law, and creating fair and accessible pathways for legal migration.

### Key Strategies for Addressing Global Migration:

1.  **Address Root Causes of Forced Migration:**
    *   Focus U.S. foreign policy and development assistance on addressing the underlying drivers that compel people to leave their homes, including poverty, lack of opportunity, violence, poor governance, human rights abuses, and climate change impacts. (See sections 4.7, 4.11, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1).

2.  **Uphold International Refugee and Human Rights Law:**
    *   Reaffirm U.S. commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its Protocol, ensuring access to asylum procedures for those fleeing persecution.
    *   Promote adherence to international human rights standards for the treatment of all migrants, regardless of their legal status, including prohibitions on arbitrary detention and refoulement (returning individuals to places where they face serious threats).

3.  **Promote Safe and Orderly Migration Pathways:**
    *   Work multilaterally and bilaterally to expand safe, legal pathways for migration, including family reunification, labor migration programs (with strong worker protections), educational opportunities, and humanitarian visas.
    *   Support international efforts, like the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to improve cooperation on migration governance.

4.  **Support Humanitarian Assistance for Refugees and Displaced Persons:**
    *   Maintain robust U.S. funding for international humanitarian organizations (like UNHCR, IOM, WFP) providing assistance and protection to refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and other migrants in vulnerable situations.
    *   Support durable solutions for refugees, including voluntary repatriation when safe, local integration in host countries, and resettlement to third countries like the U.S. (See section 4.3).

5.  **Combat Human Trafficking and Smuggling:**
    *   Strengthen international cooperation to combat transnational criminal organizations involved in human trafficking and smuggling, while ensuring that anti-trafficking efforts protect the rights of victims.

6.  **Promote Integration and Combat Xenophobia:**
    *   Support programs in host countries (including the U.S.) that facilitate the social and economic integration of migrants and refugees.
    *   Use public diplomacy and domestic policies to combat xenophobia, racism, and discrimination against migrants and refugees. (See Domestic Agenda section 2.3).

### Conclusion:

Addressing global migration requires a comprehensive, humane, and cooperative approach. By focusing on the root causes of displacement, upholding international law, expanding safe and legal pathways, providing humanitarian assistance, combating trafficking, and promoting integration, the United States can contribute to a more orderly, rights-respecting global migration system. This approach aligns with American values and enhances global stability and shared prosperity.
