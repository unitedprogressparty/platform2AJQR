## Ensuring Access to Nutritious Food for All Through Sustainable Systems

Global food security—ensuring all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food—is fundamental to human dignity, health, and stability. Yet, hundreds of millions worldwide suffer from hunger and malnutrition, a crisis exacerbated by climate change, conflict, economic inequality, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Achieving global food security requires a comprehensive approach that boosts sustainable food production, improves access and affordability, reduces food loss and waste, and builds resilience in food systems.

Our platform advocates for U.S. leadership in global efforts to end hunger and malnutrition. We support policies and investments that promote sustainable agriculture, empower smallholder farmers, strengthen food systems resilience, and ensure equitable access to nutritious food for all.

### Key Strategies for Advancing Global Food Security:

1.  **Invest in Sustainable Agriculture Research and Development:**
    *   Increase U.S. support for international agricultural research (e.g., through CGIAR) focused on developing climate-resilient, high-yield crop varieties (including locally adapted and traditional crops), sustainable farming techniques (agroecology, conservation agriculture), and efficient water management practices. (See also Domestic Agenda section 1.4.3).

2.  **Support Smallholder Farmers:**
    *   Target development assistance towards empowering smallholder farmers, particularly women, in developing countries. Provide access to credit, inputs (like quality seeds and biofertilizers), extension services, market information, and secure land tenure.
    *   Support farmer cooperatives and organizations to improve bargaining power and market access.

3.  **Build Resilient Food Systems:**
    *   Invest in infrastructure that supports food security, including rural roads, storage facilities (to reduce post-harvest loss), and cold chains.
    *   Promote diversification of food production systems to reduce reliance on a few staple crops and enhance nutritional diversity.
    *   Support the development of early warning systems for food crises and strengthen social safety nets (like food assistance or cash transfers) to protect vulnerable populations during shocks.

4.  **Promote Fair Trade and Market Access:**
    *   Advocate for international trade rules that support food security in developing countries, avoiding policies (like export restrictions or excessive agricultural subsidies in wealthy nations) that distort global markets and harm vulnerable producers and consumers. (See section 4.2).

5.  **Reduce Food Loss and Waste:**
    *   Support global initiatives aimed at reducing food loss and waste throughout the supply chain, from farm to table, through improved infrastructure, technology, and consumer awareness campaigns.

6.  **Address Conflict and Climate Change as Drivers of Hunger:**
    *   Integrate food security considerations into conflict prevention and resolution efforts, recognizing that conflict is a primary driver of famine.
    *   Support climate adaptation measures in agriculture to help farmers cope with changing weather patterns, droughts, and floods. (See section 6.1).

7.  **Ensure Humanitarian Food Assistance:**
    *   Maintain robust U.S. funding for international humanitarian food assistance programs (like those run by the World Food Programme) to respond to acute food crises, while simultaneously investing in long-term solutions to build self-sufficiency.

### Conclusion:

Ending global hunger and achieving food security for all is an achievable goal, but it requires sustained international commitment and a shift towards more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems. By investing in sustainable agriculture, supporting smallholder farmers, building resilient food systems, promoting fair trade, reducing waste, and addressing the root causes of hunger like conflict and climate change, the United States can play a vital role in creating a world where everyone has access to the nutritious food they need to thrive.
