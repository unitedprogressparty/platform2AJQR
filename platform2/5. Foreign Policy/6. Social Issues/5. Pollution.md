## Protecting Shared Environments Through International Action

Pollution does not respect national borders. Air pollution, plastic waste in oceans, hazardous chemical contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions travel across continents and seas, impacting ecosystems and human health far from their source. Addressing these transboundary and global pollution challenges requires concerted international cooperation, strong domestic regulations, and holding polluters accountable.

Our platform advocates for U.S. leadership in global efforts to prevent and reduce pollution in all its forms. We must work with international partners to strengthen environmental agreements, promote clean technologies, support pollution control efforts in developing countries, and ensure corporations adhere to high environmental standards globally.

### Key Strategies for Combating Global Pollution:

1.  **Strengthen International Environmental Agreements:**
    *   Actively participate in and work to strengthen multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) addressing issues like air pollution (e.g., Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution), chemical safety (e.g., Stockholm and Minamata Conventions), plastic pollution (e.g., negotiating a global plastics treaty), and hazardous waste (e.g., Basel Convention).
    *   Advocate for robust monitoring, reporting, verification, and compliance mechanisms within these agreements.

2.  **Reduce Transboundary Air Pollution:**
    *   Engage diplomatically with neighboring countries and major global emitters to reduce emissions of pollutants (like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, mercury) that contribute to acid rain, smog, and health problems across borders.
    *   Support international cooperation on monitoring air quality and sharing best practices for pollution control technologies.

3.  **Combat Marine Plastic Pollution:**
    *   Lead efforts to negotiate and implement an ambitious global treaty to end plastic pollution, addressing the full lifecycle of plastics from production and design to waste management and cleanup.
    *   Support international initiatives to improve waste management infrastructure, particularly in developing countries, to prevent plastics from entering waterways and oceans.
    *   Promote innovation in sustainable alternatives to plastics and circular economy approaches. (See also Domestic Agenda section 3.4).

4.  **Address Chemical and Hazardous Waste:**
    *   Strengthen international controls on the production, use, and trade of hazardous chemicals and pesticides.
    *   Support capacity building in developing countries for the sound management and disposal of hazardous waste, preventing illegal dumping and environmental contamination.
    *   Promote the adoption of green chemistry principles globally to reduce the generation of hazardous substances.

5.  **Promote Corporate Environmental Accountability:**
    *   Encourage and potentially require U.S. multinational corporations to adhere to high environmental standards in their global operations, equivalent to or exceeding U.S. domestic standards.
    *   Support international efforts to establish corporate sustainability reporting standards that include environmental impacts.

6.  **Integrate Pollution Control into Development and Trade:**
    *   Ensure that U.S. development assistance programs support environmentally sound infrastructure and industrial practices. (See section 4.7).
    *   Include enforceable environmental provisions in trade agreements to prevent pollution havens and promote clean production. (See section 4.2).

### Conclusion:

Protecting the global environment from pollution requires collective action and shared responsibility. By strengthening international agreements, tackling transboundary air and marine pollution, managing hazardous chemicals and waste, promoting corporate accountability, and integrating environmental considerations into all aspects of foreign policy, the United States can lead the way towards a cleaner, healthier planet for all.
