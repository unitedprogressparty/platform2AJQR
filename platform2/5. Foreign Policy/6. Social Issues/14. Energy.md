## Powering the World Sustainably: A Global Imperative

The global energy system, currently dominated by fossil fuels, is the primary driver of the climate crisis and a source of geopolitical instability and health problems related to air pollution. Transitioning the world to clean, sustainable, and affordable energy sources is essential for mitigating climate change, improving public health, enhancing energy security, and promoting equitable development.

Our platform advocates for strong U.S. leadership in accelerating the global energy transition. We must leverage diplomacy, international finance, technology cooperation, and trade policy to support the worldwide deployment of renewable energy, enhance energy efficiency, and ensure a just transition away from fossil fuels, particularly for developing countries and vulnerable communities.

### Key Strategies for the Global Energy Transition:

1.  **Champion Global Renewable Energy Deployment:**
    *   Set ambitious international goals for renewable energy deployment (solar, wind, geothermal, sustainable hydro) through forums like the UNFCCC, G20, and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
    *   Provide significant financial and technical support (climate finance, development aid) to help developing countries build renewable energy infrastructure and integrate it into their grids. (See sections 4.7, 6.1).

2.  **Promote Global Energy Efficiency Standards:**
    *   Work internationally to establish and harmonize ambitious energy efficiency standards for buildings, appliances, vehicles, and industrial processes.
    *   Support technology transfer and capacity building to enable countries to adopt energy-saving measures. (See section 4.5).

3.  **Phase Out Fossil Fuel Subsidies Globally:**
    *   Lead diplomatic efforts to secure international commitments to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies worldwide, redirecting those resources towards clean energy and social support.

4.  **Support a Just Transition Globally:**
    *   Provide support (financial, technical) to developing countries and communities heavily reliant on fossil fuel production to help them diversify their economies and manage a just transition for affected workers and regions.

5.  **Foster Clean Energy Innovation and Cooperation:**
    *   Increase international collaboration on research, development, and deployment (RD&D) of next-generation clean energy technologies, energy storage, smart grids, and sustainable fuels (like green hydrogen). (See section 4.5).
    *   Promote open access to clean energy research and facilitate technology transfer on fair terms.

6.  **Ensure Sustainable Supply Chains for Clean Energy:**
    *   Work with international partners to ensure that supply chains for clean energy technologies (including critical minerals) are secure, sustainable, and adhere to high environmental and labor standards. (See section 4.6).

### Conclusion:

Accelerating the global transition to clean and sustainable energy is critical for tackling climate change and building a more prosperous and secure world. Through international leadership, increased climate finance, technology cooperation, and a commitment to a just transition, the United States can play a pivotal role in powering the future sustainably and equitably. This requires a whole-of-government approach that integrates energy considerations into diplomacy, development, trade, and security policies.
