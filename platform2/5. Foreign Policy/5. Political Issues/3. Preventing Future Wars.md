## Building a More Peaceful World Through Proactive Conflict Prevention

Preventing future wars and large-scale violent conflict is a paramount goal of U.S. foreign policy. Military intervention should always be a last resort, employed only when absolutely necessary and legally justified. A proactive strategy focused on diplomacy, arms control, strengthening international institutions, and addressing the root causes of conflict offers a more sustainable and effective path to global peace and security.

Our platform advocates for a foreign policy that invests heavily in the tools of conflict prevention and resolution, reducing reliance on military solutions and fostering a global environment where disputes are resolved peacefully.

### Key Strategies for Preventing Future Wars:

1.  **Prioritize Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Invest significantly in diplomatic capacity, empowering the State Department and supporting international mediation efforts to address disputes before they escalate into violence.
    *   Support regional diplomatic initiatives and conflict resolution mechanisms.
    *   Promote dialogue and engagement even with adversaries to manage tensions and prevent miscalculation.

2.  **Advance Arms Control and Disarmament:**
    *   Pursue new arms control treaties and strengthen existing ones (like New START successors) to limit nuclear arsenals, prevent proliferation, and reduce the risk of nuclear war.
    *   Work towards international agreements regulating destabilizing conventional weapons, lethal autonomous weapons systems, and the militarization of space.
    *   Strengthen export controls and international cooperation to prevent the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons that fuel conflicts.

3.  **Strengthen International Institutions and Law:**
    *   Reinvest in and reform international institutions like the United Nations, empowering them to play a more effective role in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding.
    *   Uphold and promote adherence to international law, including the UN Charter's prohibitions on the aggressive use of force.
    *   Support international justice mechanisms to deter and punish war crimes and crimes against humanity. (See also section 5.7 International Law).

4.  **Address Root Causes of Conflict:**
    *   Focus development assistance and diplomatic efforts on addressing the underlying drivers of conflict, including poverty, inequality, resource scarcity, poor governance, corruption, human rights abuses, and the impacts of climate change. (See relevant sections under 4. Economic and 6. Social Issues).
    *   Support inclusive governance, democratic reforms, and reconciliation processes in fragile states.

5.  **Promote Global Cooperation on Transnational Threats:**
    *   Foster international cooperation to address shared threats like climate change, pandemics, and transnational terrorism, recognizing that these challenges require collective action and can exacerbate conflict if left unaddressed.

6.  **Responsible Use of Military Force:**
    *   Maintain a strong defense capability primarily for deterrence and the defense of the U.S. and its core allies.
    *   Establish strict criteria for the use of military force, requiring clear objectives, strong legal justification (including Congressional authorization), proportionality, measures to minimize civilian harm, and a viable exit strategy. Avoid unilateral interventions.

### Conclusion:

Preventing future wars requires a sustained commitment to diplomacy, arms control, international law, and addressing the root causes of conflict. By shifting U.S. foreign policy away from over-reliance on military intervention towards proactive conflict prevention and resolution, we can build a more peaceful, secure, and just world. This approach not only saves lives and resources but also strengthens global stability and enhances U.S. leadership through cooperation and adherence to international norms.
