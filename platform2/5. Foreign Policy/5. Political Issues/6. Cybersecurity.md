## Protecting Digital Infrastructure and Promoting Responsible Behavior in Cyberspace

Cyber threats—ranging from state-sponsored espionage and attacks on critical infrastructure to ransomware targeting businesses and individuals, and online disinformation campaigns—pose a significant and growing challenge to national security, economic stability, and democratic processes worldwide. Effectively addressing these threats requires a comprehensive strategy that enhances domestic cybersecurity resilience, fosters international cooperation, establishes clear norms of behavior in cyberspace, and deters malicious actors.

Our platform advocates for a proactive and collaborative approach to cybersecurity, strengthening defenses at home while working with allies to build a more secure and stable global cyberspace, grounded in international law and respect for fundamental rights.

### Key Strategies for Global Cybersecurity:

1.  **Strengthen Domestic Cybersecurity Resilience:**
    *   Invest heavily in protecting U.S. critical infrastructure (energy, finance, communications, healthcare, water) from cyberattacks through enhanced public-private partnerships, mandatory minimum security standards for critical sectors, and improved threat intelligence sharing (coordinated by CISA and other agencies).
    *   Promote cybersecurity best practices for federal agencies, state and local governments, businesses, and individuals through funding, technical assistance, and awareness campaigns.

2.  **Develop International Norms and Confidence-Building Measures:**
    *   Actively participate in and lead international efforts (e.g., at the UN) to develop and promote norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, including prohibitions against attacking critical infrastructure, interfering in elections, and conducting widespread commercial espionage.
    *   Engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues, including with adversaries, to establish communication channels, reduce the risk of miscalculation, and build confidence regarding cyber activities.

3.  **Enhance International Cooperation and Capacity Building:**
    *   Strengthen cybersecurity cooperation with allies and partners through joint exercises, intelligence sharing, coordinated incident response, and collaborative efforts to attribute and counter malicious cyber activity.
    *   Provide cybersecurity capacity-building assistance to developing countries to help them strengthen their defenses and participate effectively in global cybersecurity efforts.

4.  **Deter and Respond to Malicious Cyber Activities:**
    *   Develop and clearly articulate a deterrence posture for cyberspace, indicating that significant malicious cyber activities targeting the U.S. or its allies will face consequences.
    *   Utilize a range of tools—diplomatic, economic (sanctions), law enforcement (indictments), and potentially cyber responses—to hold state and non-state actors accountable for harmful cyber operations. Ensure responses are proportionate and consistent with international law.

5.  **Protect Privacy and Civil Liberties:**
    *   Ensure that domestic and international cybersecurity efforts are conducted in a manner consistent with privacy rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law. Maintain strong oversight and transparency for government cyber activities. (See also Domestic Agenda section 5.3).

6.  **Combat Cybercrime:**
    *   Enhance international law enforcement cooperation (through organizations like Interpol and Europol, and bilateral agreements) to investigate and prosecute transnational cybercrime, including ransomware gangs, online fraud operations, and dark web markets.

### Conclusion:

Securing cyberspace requires a sustained, collaborative effort both domestically and internationally. By strengthening our own defenses, working with allies to establish clear norms and enhance cooperation, deterring malicious actors, and upholding privacy and civil liberties, the United States can help create a more stable, secure, and trustworthy digital environment for all.
