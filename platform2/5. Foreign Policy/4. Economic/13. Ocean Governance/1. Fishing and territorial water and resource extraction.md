## Ensuring the Health and Equitable Use of Marine Ecosystems

The world's oceans are vital ecosystems that regulate climate, provide food and livelihoods for billions, and support immense biodiversity. However, they face unprecedented threats from overfishing, pollution, climate change (acidification, warming), habitat destruction, and disputes over maritime boundaries and resources. Effective ocean governance requires robust international cooperation, science-based management, and a commitment to sustainability and equity.

Our platform advocates for strong U.S. leadership in promoting sustainable ocean governance through international law, regional cooperation, and domestic action. We must ensure the long-term health of marine ecosystems while managing resources like fisheries and seabed minerals responsibly and equitably.

### Key Priorities for Sustainable Ocean Governance:

1.  **Combat Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing:**
    *   Strengthen international cooperation and enforcement mechanisms to combat IUU fishing, which depletes fish stocks, harms marine ecosystems, and undermines legitimate fishing communities.
    *   Utilize satellite monitoring, vessel tracking systems, port state measures, and targeted sanctions against entities involved in IUU fishing.
    *   Promote transparency in global fishing fleets and seafood supply chains.

2.  **Promote Sustainable Fisheries Management:**
    *   Advocate for science-based fishing quotas and ecosystem-based management approaches within Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) and in domestic waters.
    *   Support efforts to reduce bycatch, protect vulnerable marine species (like sharks, sea turtles, marine mammals), and eliminate destructive fishing practices (like bottom trawling in sensitive habitats).
    *   Support small-scale fishing communities in adopting sustainable practices.

3.  **Establish and Expand Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):**
    *   Work internationally and domestically to expand the network of effectively managed MPAs to conserve critical marine habitats, protect biodiversity hotspots, and rebuild depleted fish stocks, contributing to the global "30x30" goal for ocean conservation. (See also Domestic Agenda section 3.5).

4.  **Regulate Deep Seabed Mining and Resource Extraction:**
    *   Advocate for a precautionary approach to deep seabed mining within the framework of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and international law. Ensure rigorous environmental impact assessments, development of strong environmental regulations, and equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms *before* any commercial exploitation proceeds.
    *   Support research into the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea resource extraction.

5.  **Uphold International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS):**
    *   Accede to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to strengthen U.S. credibility and leadership in ocean governance.
    *   Promote the peaceful resolution of maritime boundary disputes based on international law and established procedures. Respect territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs).

6.  **Address Ocean Pollution:**
    *   Lead international efforts to combat marine pollution, particularly plastic waste, through global agreements, improved waste management infrastructure on land, and innovation in biodegradable materials. (See also Domestic Agenda section 3.4).
    *   Address land-based sources of pollution, such as agricultural runoff and industrial discharge, that harm coastal and marine ecosystems.

7.  **Integrate Climate Change into Ocean Management:**
    *   Support research on the impacts of climate change (warming, acidification, deoxygenation) on marine ecosystems and fisheries.
    *   Integrate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into ocean management plans.

### Conclusion:

Sustainable ocean governance is essential for the health of our planet and the well-being of humanity. By combating IUU fishing, promoting sustainable fisheries, protecting marine habitats, carefully regulating resource extraction, upholding international law, and addressing pollution and climate change, the U.S. can lead efforts to ensure our oceans remain healthy, productive, and equitably managed for generations to come.
