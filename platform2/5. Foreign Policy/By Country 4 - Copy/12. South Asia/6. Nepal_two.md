---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Nepal has historically been characterized by mutual respect and cooperation, particularly in areas such as development assistance, humanitarian aid, and counterterrorism. In recent years, U.S. engagement has focused on promoting democracy, human rights, and economic development in Nepal, particularly following the devastating earthquake in 2015 that significantly impacted the nation. The U.S. has provided substantial humanitarian assistance and funding for rebuilding efforts. Nepal's strategic position between China and India adds complexity to U.S. foreign policy, as Nepal navigates its relationships with these two powerful neighbors.

In 2021, Nepal's political landscape witnessed significant changes, including the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, amid ongoing political instability and power struggles. This has raised concerns regarding governance and stability in Nepal, presenting both challenges and opportunities for U.S. engagement. Furthermore, recent events surrounding Nepal's participation in the Indo-Pacific Strategy highlight the increasing importance of Nepal in regional geopolitics, as the U.S. seeks to counter China's influence in South Asia.

### **Crises:**

Nepal currently faces several crises, including political instability, economic challenges, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The political landscape is marked by factionalism and power struggles among various political parties, which have hindered effective governance and policy implementation. This instability has implications for U.S. interests, as a stable and democratic Nepal is essential for regional security and cooperation.

Economically, Nepal is grappling with challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, including a declining GDP, rising unemployment, and increased poverty levels. The pandemic has disrupted remittances, which are crucial for the Nepali economy, and has strained public health systems. These economic difficulties create an urgent need for U.S. assistance in areas such as economic diversification and technological support.

In addition to political and economic crises, Nepal is also dealing with environmental challenges, particularly related to climate change. The country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including floods and landslides, which threaten livelihoods and infrastructure. As climate change continues to impact Nepal, the U.S. can play a significant role in supporting climate resilience initiatives and disaster preparedness.

Looking ahead, Nepal faces potential future crises, including increased competition between China and India, which could exacerbate regional tensions. Additionally, the rise of domestic extremism and the potential for violent conflict remain concerns. The U.S. must remain engaged in supporting democratic governance and stability to mitigate these risks and ensure a prosperous future for Nepal.

**Frank Narrative** 

Nepal can significantly contribute to U.S. strategic interests in South Asia by serving as a stabilizing force in a region marked by geopolitical tensions. Historically, Nepal has partnered with the U.S. in counterterrorism efforts, particularly in addressing extremist groups that pose a threat to regional security. The U.S. has provided training and resources to Nepal's security forces, enhancing their capacity to manage internal security challenges. In the future, the U.S. seeks to strengthen this partnership by expanding counterterrorism cooperation, intelligence sharing, and joint training exercises to address emerging threats effectively.

Furthermore, Nepal's geographic location makes it a crucial player in regional trade routes and energy security. The U.S. has interests in enhancing regional connectivity and trade partnerships, particularly through initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact. By investing in infrastructure development, the U.S. can help Nepal become a transit hub for goods and energy, facilitating trade between India and China while promoting economic growth. In the future, the U.S. would like to see Nepal actively engage in regional economic forums and initiatives that align with U.S. interests.

In return, Nepal expects robust support from the U.S. to address its domestic challenges, particularly in economic development, disaster recovery, and climate resilience. U.S. assistance in technology transfer, capacity building, and investment can help Nepal diversify its economy and reduce dependence on remittances. Additionally, Nepal seeks support for strengthening democratic institutions and governance, which are vital for fostering a stable environment conducive to economic growth and social progress.

The U.S. can facilitate this cooperation by establishing frameworks for joint projects that address both countries' interests. Collaborative efforts in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness can create opportunities for economic growth while addressing pressing challenges. By investing in Nepal's development, the U.S. not only enhances its strategic partnership but also contributes to regional stability and prosperity.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Nepal has a history of contributing to U.S. strategic interests, particularly in counterterrorism and regional stability.

In the future, the U.S. hopes to see Nepal continue to play a role in regional security initiatives, particularly in countering extremism and fostering cooperation among South Asian nations.

The U.S. would like to strengthen Nepal's capacity to respond to regional challenges by enhancing military cooperation and intelligence sharing. Additionally, U.S. support for Nepal's participation in regional dialogues and initiatives can help align Nepal's interests with U.S. strategic goals in South Asia.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Nepal requires support from the U.S. and the international community to address its domestic challenges, particularly in economic diversification and disaster recovery. The U.S. can play a pivotal role by providing technological assistance, investment in infrastructure, and support for sustainable development initiatives.
