**Eswatini (Swaziland): Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The Kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a landlocked country in Southern Africa bordered by South Africa and Mozambique. The current relationship between the United States and Eswatini has been characterized by a focus on development assistance, health initiatives, and governance reforms. Recent events have highlighted the ongoing political unrest within the country, particularly following protests in 2021 advocating for democratic reforms and greater political freedom. As Eswatini navigates these challenges, the U.S. can play a critical role in supporting stability and democratic processes.

### **Crises**:

Eswatini is currently facing significant political unrest and civil discontent stemming from calls for democratic reforms. In 2021, protests erupted across the nation as citizens demanded an end to the absolute monarchy and greater political representation. The government responded with force, leading to a crackdown on dissent and raising concerns over human rights violations. This unrest is compounded by economic challenges, including high unemployment rates and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have exacerbated existing social inequalities.

Regionally, Eswatini's situation is influenced by the broader Southern Africa context, where economic disparities and governance issues persist. Neighboring countries, such as South Africa, are experiencing their own political tensions and economic challenges, creating a precarious environment for regional stability. The potential for spillover effects from Eswatini's unrest into neighboring countries presents a risk to regional security and could provoke further instability.

Looking ahead, Eswatini may also face challenges related to internal violence from extremist groups or disgruntled factions if the government fails to address the root causes of discontent. Additionally, the lack of political dialogue and reform could lead to an escalation of protests and unrest, which may further complicate U.S.-Eswatini relations. The international community, including the U.S., must remain engaged to support peaceful resolutions and promote democratic governance.

The ongoing crises in Eswatini highlight the urgency for the international community to advocate for human rights and democratic reforms. The U.S. can leverage its influence to encourage dialogue between the government and opposition groups, while also providing support to civil society organizations working towards democratic governance. Failure to address these challenges may not only destabilize Eswatini but could also have implications for broader regional stability in Southern Africa.

**Frank Narrative**

Eswatini presents a complex landscape for U.S. foreign policy interests in Southern Africa. The country has been a recipient of U.S. development assistance aimed at improving health outcomes, particularly in combatting HIV/AIDS, and supporting economic diversification. Over the years, Eswatini has cooperated with the U.S. in various initiatives, demonstrating a commitment to improving health systems and enhancing education. However, the recent political upheaval has raised concerns about governance and human rights, which are essential factors for continued U.S. support.

The U.S. seeks to strengthen its partnership with Eswatini by promoting democratic values and human rights. This entails encouraging the Eswatini government to implement reforms that allow for greater political participation and the establishment of a more transparent governance framework. The U.S. can facilitate this by providing diplomatic support for dialogue between the monarchy and opposition groups, ensuring that the voices of the citizens are heard and respected. American NGOs and civil society organizations can also play a pivotal role in this process by fostering grassroots movements advocating for reform.

In terms of economic cooperation, Eswatini stands to benefit from U.S. investments that promote sustainable development and job creation. The U.S. has an interest in diversifying the Eswatini economy, which is heavily reliant on agriculture and textiles. Supporting initiatives that focus on technology and innovation can help bolster economic resilience and reduce unemployment. The U.S. may also encourage trade agreements that provide market access for Eswatini's goods, which can contribute to economic stability and growth.

Looking to the future, the U.S. can play a proactive role in addressing the socio-economic challenges faced by Eswatini. By bolstering support for education, health, and economic diversification, the U.S. can help Eswatini build a more stable and prosperous society. In return, Eswatini can enhance its cooperation with the U.S. on regional security matters, including counterterrorism and the promotion of peace and stability in Southern Africa. This mutual benefit will create a foundation for a stronger U.S.-Eswatini partnership based on shared values and interests.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Eswatini is a small, landlocked country with a population of approximately 1.2 million people. The country is characterized by its mountainous terrain and diverse ecosystems. Eswatini operates under a monarchy, with King Mswati III holding significant political power. The GDP of Eswatini is around $4.4 billion, with a per capita income of approximately $3,570. While the country has made strides in improving access to education and healthcare, challenges remain, particularly in terms of economic inequality and unemployment. According to the Freedom House index, Eswatini scores poorly in terms of political rights and civil liberties, reflecting the limitations on democratic governance.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Eswatini's stability is crucial for regional security in Southern Africa, particularly given its geographical location. The country serves as a key transit point for trade and commerce in the region, making it important for economic partnerships. Additionally, Eswatini's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and improve public health align with U.S. global health initiatives, making it a strategic partner in health-related matters. The U.S. is also interested in promoting economic diversification in Eswatini to reduce its dependence on a few sectors, thereby enhancing regional economic stability.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Eswatini is characterized by an absolute monarchy, with substantial limitations on democratic freedoms. The ruling party, led by King Mswati III, maintains control over the government and suppresses dissent. Governance practices reveal significant discrepancies between the official structures and real-world political dynamics, with limited public participation in decision-making processes. Given the recent protests and calls for reform, it is clear that the need for democratic change is pressing, but the ruling regime has yet to embrace such reforms.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The diplomatic relationship between Eswatini and the U.S. has evolved over the years, with significant milestones including the establishment of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has facilitated trade between the two nations. In 2003, the U.S. and Eswatini signed a bilateral agreement aimed at enhancing trade and investment.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Historically, the U.S. has provided substantial development assistance to Eswatini, particularly in the health sector. However, tensions have arisen due to concerns about human rights abuses and the lack of democratic governance. The U.S. has urged the Eswatini government to adopt reforms that align with international human rights standards.

Additionally, the U.S. can advocate for international support to strengthen Eswatini's political institutions and enhance democratic governance.
