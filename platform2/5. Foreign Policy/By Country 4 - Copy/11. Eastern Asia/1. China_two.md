**China: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The relationship between the United States and China has dramatically evolved over the last few decades, characterized by both cooperation and tension. Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing trade disputes, have further complicated this relationship. The Biden administration has emphasized a strategy of competition with China, focusing on areas such as technology, trade, and global influence while also seeking avenues for cooperation on issues like climate change and public health. As China continues to assert its presence on the global stage, it has become crucial for the U.S. to navigate this complex landscape carefully.

### **Crises**:

China faces several crises both domestically and regionally. The recent resurgence of COVID-19 in various forms has raised concerns over public health management and economic recovery. This has led to increased social discontent, with protests emerging in various cities over lockdown measures and economic conditions. Additionally, the ongoing tensions in Hong Kong and the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang have drawn international criticism, impacting China's global image and relations with several nations.

Regionally, China's assertive military posture in the South China Sea has escalated tensions with neighboring countries, raising fears of conflict over territorial waters. The ongoing rivalry with Taiwan remains a significant flashpoint, with China ramping up military exercises near the island and the U.S. reaffirming its commitment to Taiwan’s defense. Furthermore, the economic challenges posed by trade relations with the U.S. and other countries, alongside the need for technological advancements, create a precarious situation for China's future stability.

Looking ahead, the potential for internal violence and unrest remains a concern, particularly if economic conditions worsen or if the government fails to address social grievances. The rise of nationalism and the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could lead to further crackdowns on dissent. Additionally, China's increasing involvement in Africa and Latin America raises questions about its long-term strategic goals and how these might conflict with U.S. interests.

**Frank Narrative**

China has been an essential player in the global economy, and its contributions to U.S. strategic interests cannot be overstated. As a major trading partner, China plays a significant role in the supply chain for numerous industries, including technology, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. U.S. companies benefit from access to China's vast market, and American consumers enjoy lower prices as a result of imports. However, the U.S. has also sought to address issues such as intellectual property theft and trade imbalances, which have strained relations. Moving forward, it is crucial for both nations to work collaboratively on issues like climate change, where China’s participation is vital for global efforts to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy.

In the context of security, China has been a partner in certain counterterrorism efforts, particularly in the fight against extremist groups within its borders. However, the U.S. expects China to take a more proactive role in addressing regional security threats, such as North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the instability in Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. In the future, the U.S. would like to see China engage in multilateral initiatives to foster stability in the Asia-Pacific region, promoting dialogue and cooperation with neighboring countries to mitigate tensions.

China also requires support from the U.S. and the global community to address its domestic challenges. Economic diversification is a pressing need, as reliance on exports and manufacturing has led to vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic. Technological assistance from the U.S. could help accelerate China's transition to a more innovation-driven economy. Additionally, China's efforts to improve its environmental policies could benefit from U.S. collaboration, particularly in renewable energy research and sustainable development practices.

The U.S. must seek to engage China positively while holding it accountable for its actions. This requires a delicate balance of diplomacy and firmness, ensuring that the U.S. maintains its commitment to human rights and democratic values while also recognizing the importance of economic interdependence. Through constructive dialogue and mutual respect, both nations can work towards achieving shared goals that contribute to global stability and prosperity.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

China, officially known as the People's Republic of China, is the world's most populous country, with over 1.4 billion people. It covers approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, making it the fourth largest country by area. Politically, China is governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and operates as a one-party state. As of 2021, China's GDP was approximately $17 trillion, making it the second largest economy globally. The quality of life varies widely, with significant urban-rural disparities. According to the Freedom House index, China scores poorly in terms of political freedoms and civil liberties, reflecting the restrictive governance practices under the CCP.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

China's strategic location and vast resources, including rare earth minerals and significant energy reserves, play a pivotal role in global supply chains. Its political stance, often at odds with U.S. interests, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, has implications for regional stability. The U.S. views China as a competitor in areas such as technological innovation, military capabilities, and influence over international institutions. As a major player in climate change discussions, China's policies will significantly impact global efforts to address environmental challenges.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in China is dominated by the CCP, which exercises strict control over political expression and dissent. While the Chinese government has made some attempts to project a façade of democratic governance through local elections, the overarching authority of the CCP undermines genuine democratic practices. The current leadership under Xi Jinping has further consolidated power, leading to increased repression of civil society and dissent. Human rights abuses, particularly in regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, remain significant concerns that strain bilateral relations with the U.S. and other western nations.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
The relationship between the U.S. and China has been shaped by several key events, including President Nixon’s historic visit to China in 1972, which marked the beginning of formal diplomatic relations. The 2001 accession of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) signaled a new era of economic engagement but also set the stage for future trade tensions. In recent years, issues such as trade disputes, human rights violations, and military posturing in the South China Sea have led to escalating tensions.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
The U.S. and China have engaged in various partnerships, including the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue and cooperative initiatives on climate change. However, conflicts have arisen over trade imbalances, technology transfer, and territorial disputes. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in an effort to address these issues, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war. Relations have been strained by China's assertive foreign policy, raising concerns about its intentions in the Indo-Pacific region.

Future collaboration could involve joint exercises or dialogues aimed at crisis management and conflict prevention.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

**Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**  
China plays a significant role in shaping regional and global diplomacy, particularly within organizations like the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

Engaging China in multilateral forums can pave the way for collaboration on global issues such as climate change and health crises.

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**  
China has the potential to act as a mediator in regional conflicts, leveraging its relationships with countries like North Korea. The U.S. can encourage China to participate in multilateral efforts to resolve conflicts, fostering a cooperative approach to global challenges.
