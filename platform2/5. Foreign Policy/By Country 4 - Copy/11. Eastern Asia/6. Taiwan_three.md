---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Taiwan has been characterized by mutual interests in democracy, security, and economic stability. In recent years, Taiwan has become increasingly important to U.S. foreign policy due to rising tensions with China, which claims sovereignty over the island. The U.S. has continued to strengthen its unofficial relationship with Taiwan, providing military support and engaging in high-level diplomatic visits. Recent events, such as the U.S. passing the Taiwan Travel Act and increased arms sales to Taiwan, highlight the U.S.'s commitment to Taiwan's defense and democratic governance. Additionally, Taiwan's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has garnered international praise, further solidifying its status as a key ally in Asia.

### **Crises**:

Taiwan faces a multitude of crises, both internally and regionally, particularly concerning its relationship with China. The ongoing threat of Chinese military aggression remains a significant concern as military drills and incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone have escalated. This has created a climate of insecurity for the Taiwanese people, prompting calls for enhanced defense capabilities. Additionally, Taiwan has dealt with internal political challenges, including social divisions regarding its identity and relationship with China. The recent elections have underscored these divisions, impacting public sentiment and political stability.

Regionally, Taiwan's situation is compounded by China's assertive foreign policy, which has led to increased tensions in the South China Sea and with other neighboring countries. The geopolitical landscape in East Asia is shifting, with the potential for conflict escalating if diplomatic solutions are not prioritized. The U.S. has a vested interest in maintaining stability in the region, as a conflict over Taiwan could have significant implications for global trade and security. Furthermore, Taiwan's relationship with its neighbors, particularly Japan and the Philippines, is critical in countering Chinese influence, but it also poses risks of regional escalation.

In summary, Taiwan is navigating a precarious situation with immediate threats from China and internal challenges that could affect its governance and stability. The U.S. must consider these factors when formulating its foreign policy toward Taiwan, ensuring that it supports the island's defense while promoting democratic values and regional stability.

**Frank Narrative**

Taiwan's strategic location in East Asia makes it a critical partner for the United States in achieving regional stability and countering Chinese influence. The U.S. has historically supported Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, recognizing that a stable and democratic Taiwan contributes to the overall security of the Asia-Pacific region. The ongoing military threat from China necessitates that the U.S. continues to strengthen its military cooperation with Taiwan, including arms sales and joint military exercises, to deter potential aggression. Furthermore, Taiwan's robust democracy serves as a counterexample to authoritarian governance, aligning with U.S. values and interests.

In addition to security cooperation, Taiwan has been a vital player in global supply chains, particularly in the semiconductor industry. The U.S. has a direct interest in ensuring that Taiwan remains a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, as these technologies are essential for various sectors, including defense and technology. The Biden administration's focus on strengthening supply chains and reducing reliance on China has highlighted the importance of Taiwan as a strategic partner in this regard. Moving forward, the U.S. should work with Taiwan to enhance its technological capabilities and foster innovation, ensuring that both nations benefit from a strong economic partnership.

Moreover, Taiwan's proactive approach to public health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has demonstrated its ability to respond effectively to global health challenges. The U.S. can collaborate with Taiwan in areas such as vaccine development and distribution, public health research, and pandemic preparedness. This partnership not only addresses immediate health concerns but also reinforces Taiwan's role as a responsible global actor. By supporting Taiwan in these areas, the U.S. can help to solidify its international standing and showcase the benefits of democratic governance.

Ultimately, the U.S. must navigate its relationship with Taiwan with a clear understanding of the risks and opportunities. Supporting Taiwan's self-defense and democratic values while fostering economic ties will be critical in ensuring that the island remains stable and secure in the face of external pressures. The U.S. must continue to advocate for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and highlight its contributions to regional stability, reinforcing the idea that a secure Taiwan is beneficial not just for the island itself but for the broader Asia-Pacific region.
