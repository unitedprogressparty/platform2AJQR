**Zimbabwe: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between Zimbabwe and the United States has been complex and often strained, particularly since the late 1990s when political and economic crises began to escalate in Zimbabwe. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on various Zimbabwean officials and entities due to human rights abuses and electoral misconduct. However, recent years have seen a slight thaw in relations, with the U.S. expressing a willingness to engage with the new Zimbabwean administration led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Robert Mugabe in 2017. In 2022, the U.S. re-engaged with Zimbabwe through a series of diplomatic initiatives aimed at supporting democratic reforms, economic recovery, and addressing humanitarian needs. 

### **Crises**:

Zimbabwe is currently facing a multitude of crises, both domestically and regionally. Economically, Zimbabwe struggles with hyperinflation, high unemployment rates, and a declining agricultural sector, which have led to widespread poverty and food insecurity. Human rights abuses remain rampant, with reports of state-sponsored violence against political opponents and civil society activists. The political landscape is also unstable, with the potential for unrest leading up to the 2023 elections, as opposition parties and civil society question the legitimacy of the electoral process.

Regionally, Zimbabwe is impacted by the socio-political instability of neighboring countries such as South Africa and Mozambique. The influx of refugees from conflict zones adds pressure on Zimbabwe's already strained resources. Additionally, the ongoing effects of climate change, such as droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, threaten agricultural output and exacerbate food shortages. The potential for rebel activity and civil unrest in the region poses a future risk, as discontent among the population could lead to increased violence.

In summary, Zimbabwe’s current crises encompass economic turmoil, human rights violations, political instability, and regional pressures. The country's ability to navigate these challenges will significantly impact its relations with the United States and the broader international community.

**Frank Narrative**

Zimbabwe has long been a country of interest for the United States, primarily due to its strategic location in Southern Africa and its rich natural resources. The U.S. has expressed its commitment to supporting democracy and human rights within Zimbabwe, and this is where Zimbabwe can play a crucial role in helping the U.S. achieve its regional goals. By committing to genuine democratic reforms, including free and fair elections, Zimbabwe can contribute to the stability of the Southern African region, thereby aligning its interests with those of the U.S.

Past contributions from Zimbabwe to U.S. strategic interests include its role in regional peacekeeping efforts and its participation in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Although the relationship has been fraught with tensions, the U.S. recognizes the potential for Zimbabwe to act as a stabilizing force in the region, particularly in fostering dialogue among neighboring states. In the future, the U.S. would like Zimbabwe to enhance its commitment to human rights, implement economic reforms that attract foreign investment, and contribute to regional security initiatives.

On the other hand, Zimbabwe has its own expectations from the United States. The country seeks economic assistance to revitalize its economy, which has been devastated by years of mismanagement and sanctions. Zimbabwe is in urgent need of technical assistance to improve governance and transparency, as well as support for infrastructure development and investment in key sectors such as agriculture and energy. By providing this support, the U.S. can help Zimbabwe address its domestic challenges while simultaneously advancing its own foreign policy objectives.

In essence, Zimbabwe has the potential to be a valuable partner for the U.S. if it can commit to the necessary reforms and stability measures. The U.S. must balance its support with a commitment to holding Zimbabwe accountable for its human rights record and governance practices. The mutual benefits of cooperation could pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future for both nations.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*Past and present contributions to U.S. strategic interests (e.g., counterterrorism, energy security).*

Zimbabwe has historically contributed to regional stability in Southern Africa through its participation in peacekeeping missions and its role in negotiations surrounding conflicts in countries such as Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.S. has a vested interest in ensuring that Zimbabwe remains a stabilizing force in the region, especially as rising tensions and conflicts in neighboring countries could have spillover effects. The U.S. would like to see Zimbabwe take a more active role in regional security initiatives, including collaborations on counter-terrorism efforts and the fight against human trafficking.

*What we would like in the future*

In the future, the U.S. aims to foster a partnership that supports democratic governance in Zimbabwe, encourages economic reforms, and promotes human rights. This includes seeking Zimbabwe's cooperation in participating in regional dialogues aimed at resolving conflicts and stabilizing the Southern African region. By engaging with Zimbabwe on these fronts, the U.S. can help create a more conducive environment for trade and investment, which is essential for regional growth.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

*Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges (e.g., economic diversification, technological assistance).*

Zimbabwe requires substantial assistance to address its pressing domestic challenges, particularly in economic diversification and technological advancements. The U.S. can play a pivotal role by providing technical assistance to help Zimbabwe transition from an economy heavily reliant on agriculture to one that embraces innovation and technology. This could involve training programs aimed at enhancing the skills of the workforce, as well as investments in renewable energy and infrastructure development.

Moreover, Zimbabwe needs support in combating corruption and improving governance, which are critical to attracting foreign investment. The U.S. can assist by promoting best practices in transparency and accountability and supporting civil society organizations that advocate for democratic reforms. By fostering these improvements, the U.S. can help create a more stable environment for economic growth in Zimbabwe.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Zimbabwe is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, bordered by South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, and Botswana. It has a population of approximately 15 million people and a GDP of about $21 billion as of 2023. The country’s economy has been in decline for over a decade, primarily due to hyperinflation, land reform policies, and poor governance. The quality of life for many Zimbabweans is low, with high unemployment rates and limited access to basic services. The Freedom House index ranks Zimbabwe as "Not Free," reflecting significant human rights abuses and restrictions on political freedoms.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Zimbabwe's strategic location provides access to key trade routes in Southern Africa, making it an important player in regional trade and security dynamics. The country is rich in natural resources, including minerals like platinum, gold, and diamonds, which are of interest to global markets. The political stance of Zimbabwe, particularly regarding human rights and governance, influences the stability of the entire Southern African region. A stable Zimbabwe could serve as a counterbalance to unrest in neighboring countries, thereby contributing to U.S. strategic interests in regional stability and security.

**Democracy Score:**

Zimbabwe's political landscape is characterized by a long history of authoritarian rule, particularly under former President Robert Mugabe. The current ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), has maintained a tight grip on power, often resorting to violent repression of opposition parties and civil rights activists. Despite recent promises of reform from President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the actual governance practices have not shown significant improvement. While the government has made efforts to open dialogue with opposition groups, the ruling party continues to face accusations of electoral fraud and human rights violations.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S. and Zimbabwe established formal diplomatic relations in 1980 after Zimbabwe's independence from British colonial rule. In the late 1990s, relations soured due to widespread human rights abuses and electoral fraud, leading to the imposition of sanctions. The U.S. has since focused on promoting democratic governance and human rights within Zimbabwe.

- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Major treaties and partnerships between Zimbabwe and the U.S. include the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) of 2001, which aimed to promote democracy and economic recovery. However, these relations have been strained due to ongoing human rights abuses and lack of political accountability. The bilateral relationship has seen some improvement under the Mnangagwa administration, though concerns remain about the government's commitment to democratic reforms.

### **2. Strategic Importance**

**Economic Interests:**

- **Trade Relationships:**  
  The U.S. is not among Zimbabwe's largest trading partners; however, bilateral trade exists, primarily in agricultural goods and minerals. Zimbabwe exports tobacco, cotton, and minerals to the U.S. while importing machinery and vehicle parts. The trade relationship has been hindered by sanctions and Zimbabwe's economic difficulties, but opportunities for growth exist through potential trade agreements.

- **Strategic Resources and Economic Partnerships:**  
  Zimbabwe possesses significant mineral resources, including platinum and diamonds, which are critical for global markets. The U.S. could benefit from partnerships aimed at responsible resource management and extraction practices while assisting Zimbabwe in diversifying its economy beyond mineral extraction.

**Security & Defense:**

- **Shared Security Concerns or Threats:**  
  Zimbabwe faces internal security threats stemming from political instability and potential civil unrest. The rise of opposition movements and dissatisfaction among the populace could lead to violence, particularly as the country approaches elections. Furthermore, regional security threats from neighboring countries experiencing conflict or instability could spill over into Zimbabwe, impacting U.S. interests.

- **Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**  
  Zimbabwe has historically engaged in joint military exercises with neighboring countries and has participated in regional peacekeeping missions. The U.S. could explore opportunities for military cooperation in areas such as training and capacity building to enhance Zimbabwe's ability to manage internal and regional security threats.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

- **Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**  
  Zimbabwe has a critical role in regional organizations such as the African Union (AU) and SADC. Its participation in these bodies can influence regional trade agreements and diplomatic negotiations pertaining to security issues. The U.S. can leverage Zimbabwe's diplomatic influence to promote stability and cooperation within the region.

- **Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**  
  Zimbabwe has the potential to act as a mediator in regional conflicts, given its historical experience and relationships in Southern Africa. The U.S. can support Zimbabwe in this role, fostering multilateral cooperation to address shared challenges and promote regional stability.

### **3. Current Challenges and Opportunities**

**Political & Governance Issues:**

- **Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Considerations:**  
  Human rights abuses in Zimbabwe remain a significant concern, with reports of harassment, violence, and intimidation against political opponents and activists. The U.S. should advocate for reforms that promote accountability and transparency while supporting civil society organizations that work to protect human rights and foster democracy.

- **Government Stability and Policy Continuity:**  
  The political dynamics in Zimbabwe are precarious, with potential for unrest as the 2023 elections approach. Internal divisions within the ruling party and opposition groups could lead to power struggles, impacting governance and stability. The U.S. should engage with both the government and opposition to encourage dialogue and peaceful transitions of power.

- **What agreements and treaties and organizations are we currently in together. List them all.**  
  Current agreements include the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) and various partnerships with civil society organizations aimed at promoting human rights and governance reforms. Zimbabwe is a member of the African Union (AU) and SADC, which play pivotal roles in regional cooperation and conflict resolution.

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

- **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**  
  Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries have limited Zimbabwe's access to international markets, constraining its economic recovery. The U.S. should consider a review of sanctions in exchange for tangible progress in human rights and governance improvements to facilitate trade and investment.

- **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**  
  The U.S. can explore new trade agreements that focus on agricultural exports and sustainable resource management. By promoting fair trade practices and investment opportunities, both nations can benefit economically.

**Security and Geopolitical Tensions:**

- **Regional Conflicts or Alliances Affecting Bilateral Relations:**  
  Zimbabwe's relations with neighboring countries are influenced by regional conflicts, particularly in Mozambique and South Africa. The U.S. should support Zimbabwe's engagement in regional dialogues to address these tensions and promote stability.

- **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**  
  The threat of terrorism in Southern Africa is increasing, particularly with the rise of extremist groups in the region. The U.S. can assist Zimbabwe in strengthening its counter-terrorism capabilities and enhancing cybersecurity measures.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

- **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**  
  Zimbabwe has experienced significant outward migration due to political and economic instability, leading to a diaspora that has influenced public opinion in the U.S. Cultural exchanges can help foster understanding and improve relations between the two nations.

- **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**  
  While both countries value democracy and human rights, Zimbabwe's governance practices often conflict with these ideals. The U.S. must navigate these differences while promoting shared values through diplomatic engagement.

**Climate Change and Environmental Challenges:**

- **Impact of Climate Change on Both Nations:**  
  Climate change poses severe risks to Zimbabwe's agricultural sector, leading to food insecurity and economic instability. The U.S. should collaborate with Zimbabwe on climate resilience initiatives and sustainable agricultural practices.

- **Opportunities for Joint Climate Initiatives and Renewable Energy Projects:**  
  The U.S. can invest in renewable energy projects in Zimbabwe, helping the country transition to sustainable energy sources while addressing climate challenges.

- **Environmental Risks Affecting Bilateral Stability and Regional Security:**  
  Environmental degradation and resource scarcity could exacerbate tensions within Zimbabwe and the region. The U.S. should prioritize environmental cooperation to mitigate these risks.
