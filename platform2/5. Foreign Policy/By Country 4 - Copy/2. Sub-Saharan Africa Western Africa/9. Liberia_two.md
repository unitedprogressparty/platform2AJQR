**Liberia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Liberia, a country located on the West African coast, shares a complex and evolving relationship with the United States, rooted in historical ties dating back to the 19th century when freed American slaves established the nation. Recent events, particularly the democratic elections of 2017 and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have shaped the current dynamics between the two nations. The U.S. has been a key partner in Liberia's post-civil war recovery, supporting peacekeeping efforts and democratic governance. However, challenges such as corruption, economic instability, and health crises remain critical issues that can impact bilateral relations moving forward.

### **Crises**:

Liberia faces several crises that stem from both historical challenges and contemporary issues. The country is still grappling with the legacies of its brutal civil wars, which lasted from 1989 to 2003. Although peace has been restored, political instability and social unrest continue to pose risks. The recent tensions surrounding the 2023 presidential elections illustrate the fragility of Liberia's democratic processes, with fears of electoral violence and political polarization emerging. Furthermore, the nation faces a public health crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has strained its healthcare system and economic resources.

The region is also affected by broader security concerns, including the rise of extremist groups in West Africa and transnational organized crime. Liberia's geographic location along the coast makes it vulnerable to illicit trafficking and potential spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea. The country has made strides in improving its security forces, but the potential for insurgency or civil unrest remains a pressing concern.

Additionally, economic challenges, including high unemployment rates and reliance on a narrow range of exports, contribute to social discontent. The impact of climate change, leading to flooding and resource scarcity, further exacerbates these issues, threatening both agricultural productivity and infrastructure. Without a concerted effort to address these vulnerabilities, Liberia risks slipping back into instability, which could have far-reaching consequences for regional security.

In summary, Liberia's current crises are multifaceted, involving political, economic, and social dimensions. The U.S. must remain engaged to help Liberia navigate these challenges and promote stability in the region.

**Frank Narrative** 

The United States has significant interests in Liberia, particularly in promoting democratic governance and regional stability. Liberia's strategic location along the West African coast provides critical access to shipping routes and trade networks. The U.S. has historically supported Liberia's transition to democracy, especially following the end of its civil wars. By providing economic aid, technical assistance, and security cooperation, the U.S. has aimed to foster a stable and democratic Liberia that can serve as a bulwark against regional instability. 

In the context of counterterrorism, Liberia's location makes it a pivotal player in combatting the spread of extremist ideologies in West Africa. The U.S. has an interest in bolstering Liberia's security forces to counter potential threats from extremist groups operating in the region. By enhancing military cooperation and intelligence sharing, the U.S. hopes to create a more secure environment that can prevent the emergence of violent extremism and ensure the safety of its own interests in West Africa.

Moving forward, the U.S. would like to see Liberia take a more proactive role in regional security initiatives and peacekeeping operations. By strengthening its military capabilities and engaging in joint exercises with U.S. forces, Liberia can contribute to a more stable West African region. Additionally, the U.S. is interested in promoting economic diversification within Liberia, encouraging growth in sectors beyond rubber and mining. This would not only enhance Liberia's resilience but also create opportunities for U.S. businesses.

In light of the ongoing crises, the U.S. must continue to support Liberia in building institutional capacity, promoting good governance, and addressing corruption. By fostering a strong civil society and independent judiciary, the U.S. can help Liberia achieve its long-term goals of stability and prosperity, ultimately aligning with American interests in a secure and prosperous West Africa.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

Liberia has the potential to significantly contribute to U.S. strategic interests in West Africa, particularly in areas of counterterrorism and regional stability. The country’s historical ties to the U.S. provide a foundation for cooperation in promoting democratic governance and economic development. In the past, Liberia has played a crucial role in peacekeeping efforts under the auspices of the United Nations, showcasing its capacity to contribute to regional security.

In the future, the U.S. would like Liberia to enhance its participation in regional security initiatives, particularly in collaboration with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). By strengthening its military capabilities and engaging in joint exercises with U.S. forces, Liberia can help combat emerging threats of terrorism and instability in the region. Furthermore, the U.S. seeks to work with Liberia to promote economic diversification, reducing its reliance on traditional exports and fostering sustainable growth.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Liberia requires support from the U.S. and the international community to address its key domestic challenges. Economic diversification is critical, as the country remains heavily reliant on agriculture and primary commodities. U.S. investment in infrastructure, technology, and education can help Liberia build a more resilient economy. Additionally, technical assistance in governance and anti-corruption measures is essential for strengthening institutions and promoting transparency.

Moreover, Liberia's healthcare system needs significant improvement, particularly in light of recent public health crises. Collaboration with the U.S. on public health initiatives can enhance Liberia's capacity to respond to pandemics and improve overall health outcomes. By addressing these critical areas, the U.S. can help Liberia achieve its goals while advancing its own strategic interests in the region.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Liberia is located on the West African coast and is bordered by Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire. The country has a population of approximately 5 million and an economy primarily based on agriculture, mining, and exports of rubber and iron ore. The GDP of Liberia is around $3 billion, with significant challenges related to poverty and unemployment. The Human Development Index (HDI) score reflects low quality of life, with issues such as access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure remaining critical. Liberia ranks low in freedom indices, facing challenges related to governance, rule of law, and human rights.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Liberia's location makes it strategically significant for U.S. interests in West Africa. The country serves as a vital link in shipping routes and trade networks, with potential resources such as iron ore and rubber that are of interest to global markets. Furthermore, Liberia's political stability is crucial for regional security, as instability could lead to spillover effects in neighboring countries and hinder U.S. efforts to combat extremism in West Africa.

**Democracy Score:**

Liberia has made strides in its democratic governance since the end of its civil wars, but challenges remain. The ruling party, the Coalition for Democratic Change, has faced criticism for governance practices and alleged corruption.

Significant moments include the U.S. support for Liberia during the civil wars and the subsequent peacekeeping efforts led by the United Nations.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
Bilateral relations have been influenced by various agreements and partnerships, including the 2003 Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the civil wars. The U.S. has also provided substantial economic and military assistance to Liberia during its recovery. However, relations have been strained by issues of corruption and governance, which threaten to undermine the progress made in rebuilding the nation.
