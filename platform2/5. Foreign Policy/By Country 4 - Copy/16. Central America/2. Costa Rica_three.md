**Costa Rica: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Costa Rica has long been regarded as a stable and peaceful nation in Central America, known for its commitment to democracy and environmental sustainability. Recently, Costa Rica has faced challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted its economy, particularly in tourismâ€”a key sector. The Biden administration has expressed a desire to strengthen ties with Costa Rica, particularly in areas such as climate change, human rights, and regional security. A recent notable event was Costa Rica's election in February 2022, which resulted in the leadership of President Rodrigo Chaves Robles, signaling a commitment to reforms and addressing economic challenges.

### **Crises**:

Currently, Costa Rica is grappling with several crises, including economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, rising crime rates, and the effects of climate change. The pandemic severely impacted its tourism-dependent economy, leading to increased unemployment and social unrest as citizens demand more support from the government. In the broader region, Central America faces challenges such as political instability, migration pressures, and gang violence, which have significant implications for Costa Rica, a nation that prides itself on its peaceful reputation.

Additionally, the economic fallout from global events, including the Russia-Ukraine war, has led to rising fuel prices and inflation, straining Costa Rica's ability to provide basic services. Environmental crises, particularly related to climate change, are anticipated to become more severe, threatening biodiversity and leading to resource scarcity. Increased migration from neighboring countries due to violence and poverty also presents challenges, as Costa Rica finds itself balancing humanitarian obligations with national security concerns.

In the near future, Costa Rica may face additional crises related to food security and potential internal unrest as citizens grapple with economic hardships. The ongoing pressures from drug trafficking and organized crime, although historically lower than in neighboring countries, could escalate as these groups seek to exploit vulnerabilities within Costa Rican society. The U.S. has a vested interest in supporting Costa Rica through these crises, as stability in the region directly correlates with U.S. national security interests.

**Frank Narrative**

Costa Rica has been an essential partner for the United States in Central America, especially regarding regional stability and environmental protection. Historically, Costa Rica has contributed to U.S. strategic interests by promoting democracy and human rights in the region. The country has also been a leader in environmental conservation efforts, showcasing sustainable practices that align with global climate goals. As the U.S. seeks to address climate change, Costa Rica's initiatives in reforestation and renewable energy could serve as a model for collaboration.

In terms of security, Costa Rica has cooperated with the U.S. in countering drug trafficking and organized crime. Joint initiatives have focused on enhancing border security and intelligence-sharing to combat transnational crime. While Costa Rica has maintained a standing military for over 70 years, its police forces and law enforcement agencies are critical in addressing security challenges. Looking to the future, the U.S. may seek to deepen military cooperation and provide technical assistance to strengthen Costa Rica's law enforcement capabilities further, ensuring regional stability.

The U.S. must also support Costa Rica in tackling its domestic challenges, particularly regarding economic diversification and technological advancement. The country has relied heavily on tourism, making it vulnerable to external shocks like the pandemic. By fostering economic partnerships and investments in emerging sectors such as technology and green energy, the U.S. can help Costa Rica create a more resilient economy. This support could also pave the way for U.S. companies to invest in Costa Rican startups, enhancing innovation and economic growth.

Finally, as Costa Rica continues to navigate its political landscape under President Chaves, the U.S. should engage diplomatically to reinforce democratic values and good governance. Encouraging transparency and accountability within Costa Rican institutions will be vital for maintaining stability and fostering a thriving partnership. The U.S. has a unique opportunity to bolster Costa Rica's efforts in social justice, labor rights, and gender equality, aligning with broader U.S. foreign policy objectives.
