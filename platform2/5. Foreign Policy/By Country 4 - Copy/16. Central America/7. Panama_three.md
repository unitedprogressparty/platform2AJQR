**Panama: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and Panama has been historically significant due to Panama's strategic geographic position as the location of the Panama Canal, a crucial trade artery. In recent years, Panama has strengthened its ties with the U.S. through cooperation on security, trade, and counter-narcotics efforts. The U.S. has provided assistance to Panama in combating drug trafficking and organized crime, which remain pressing issues in the region. A recent event of note was the U.S. support during Panama's efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccine distribution and public health initiatives. However, challenges remain, including concerns over governance, corruption, and human rights practices in Panama.

### **Crises**:

What, if any, crises is this country, and region currently facing, crises very recently overcome, or anticipating crises to occur in the near future? Include both country and region.

Panama is currently facing several crises that have implications for both domestic stability and regional security. One pressing issue is the ongoing challenge of organized crime, particularly related to drug trafficking, which has seen an uptick in violence and corruption. The rise of gangs has led to increased tensions in urban areas, particularly in Panama City, where clashes between rival factions pose a risk to public safety and governance. Additionally, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated existing inequalities, leading to protests and social unrest as citizens demand better economic opportunities and government accountability.

Regionally, Central America is grappling with migration pressures as individuals flee violence and poverty, often seeking refuge in the U.S. This situation places additional strain on Panama, which serves as a transit country for migrants heading north. The potential for increased migration flows could lead to humanitarian crises and challenge Panama's border management capabilities. Furthermore, there are concerns about the environmental impact of climate change, particularly in relation to rising sea levels and deforestation, which threaten Panama's biodiversity and ecological stability.

Anticipating future crises, Panama may face challenges related to political instability if corruption remains unchecked and public dissatisfaction continues to grow. The upcoming elections in 2024 could also lead to heightened tensions, particularly if the political process is perceived as compromised. Additionally, the potential for increased drug trafficking and gang violence may continue to threaten the security landscape, requiring sustained cooperation with external partners like the U.S. to address these multifaceted challenges.

**Frank Narrative** 

Panama holds a strategic position in Central America, acting as a vital conduit for international maritime trade through the Panama Canal. This geographic advantage translates into a unique opportunity for the U.S. to collaborate with Panama on regional stability and security initiatives. Historically, Panama has been a partner in U.S. efforts to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, contributing to the broader goal of ensuring safe and secure trade routes. The U.S. has provided training, resources, and intelligence-sharing to strengthen Panama's security forces and enhance their capabilities in addressing these challenges.

As Panama navigates its own internal struggles with corruption and governance, it is imperative for the U.S. to engage in constructive dialogue that emphasizes the importance of democratic values and accountability. By supporting initiatives aimed at enhancing transparency and reducing corruption, the U.S. can foster a more resilient partner in the region. This approach aligns with the U.S. interests of promoting stability and prosperity throughout Central America, ultimately contributing to a more secure hemisphere.

Looking forward, the U.S. would benefit from a continued partnership with Panama to address shared interests, particularly in the areas of counter-narcotics and economic development. As Panama seeks to diversify its economy beyond the canal and finance sectors, U.S. investment in technology, renewable energy, and infrastructure could yield mutual benefits. In return, the U.S. must remain committed to supporting Panama's efforts to strengthen its democratic institutions and promote social equity, recognizing that a stable and prosperous Panama is integral to regional security.

In conclusion, the future of U.S.-Panama relations hinges on a commitment to cooperative engagement that prioritizes shared goals in security, governance, and economic development. By addressing the root causes of instability and supporting Panama in its pursuit of democratic progress, the U.S. can help ensure a lasting partnership that contributes to the welfare of both nations and the broader Central American region.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

* Past and present contributions to U.S. strategic interests (e.g., counterterrorism, energy security).  
  * What we would like in the future

Panama has been instrumental in U.S. strategic interests, particularly in the realms of counterterrorism and combating drug trafficking. The country has provided intelligence and logistical support to U.S. efforts aimed at reducing the flow of narcotics through Central America. Furthermore, Panama's role as a financial hub makes it pivotal in the fight against money laundering and other financial crimes that underpin global terrorism. Looking to the future, the U.S. would like Panama to continue enhancing its law enforcement capabilities while also fostering economic growth that reduces the appeal of gang involvement and drug-related activities.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

* Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges (e.g., economic diversification, technological assistance).

Panama requires U.S. support in various domains to address its domestic challenges, including economic diversification away from reliance on the canal and finance sectors. Assistance in developing sectors such as technology, renewable energy, and agriculture could provide sustainable economic opportunities for its citizens. Additionally, Panama needs technological assistance to enhance its cybersecurity infrastructure, particularly given the rising threats posed by cybercrime and data breaches.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Panama is located in Central America, bordered by Costa Rica to the west and Colombia to the southeast, with coastlines on both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The country has a population of approximately 4.4 million people and an economy that relies heavily on the Panama Canal, banking, and commerce. As of 2022, Panama's GDP was estimated at $66.9 billion, with a per capita income of around $15,000. The quality of life in Panama is relatively high, with a Human Development Index score of 0.795, indicating a moderate level of development. However, challenges persist, including income inequality and corruption, which impact overall societal well-being.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Panama's strategic location at the crossroads of North and South America, combined with its control of the Panama Canal, positions it as a critical player in global trade. The canal facilitates approximately 5% of global maritime traffic, making Panama essential for international shipping and logistics. The U.S. has a vested interest in maintaining stability in Panama to ensure the uninterrupted flow of goods through this vital waterway. Additionally, Panama's cooperation in counter-narcotics and regional security efforts aligns with U.S. national security interests.

**Democracy Score:**

Panama's political landscape is characterized by a democratic system, but it faces significant challenges related to governance practices. The ruling party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), has been criticized for corruption and inefficiency, leading to public dissatisfaction. Recent governance practices have raised concerns about the rule of law and the protection of civil liberties. While elections are regularly held, the political dynamics often reflect a struggle for power among elite groups rather than genuine democratic representation.

**Historical Context:**

* **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S.-Panama relationship has evolved since the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 20th century. The signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977 marked a significant milestone, leading to the transfer of control of the canal to Panama in 1999. These treaties established a framework for cooperation on security and trade.

* **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Previous agreements have focused on counter-narcotics cooperation, trade relations, and security partnerships. The U.S. has engaged with Panama in various initiatives, including the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which has bolstered trade ties. Relations have been strained at times due to concerns over corruption and governance issues, leading to calls for reform from both domestic and international stakeholders.

  The U.S. and Panama are involved in several agreements, including the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), various counter-narcotics cooperation agreements, and the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation. Both countries are also members of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Central American Integration System (SICA).

**Economic & Trade Concerns:**

* **Trade Imbalances, Sanctions, or Market Access Issues:**  
  Trade imbalances persist, with Panama importing more from the U.S. than it exports. Addressing these imbalances could enhance bilateral relations and provide economic benefits for both nations. Additionally, any potential sanctions related to governance issues could impact trade dynamics.

* **Opportunities for New Trade Agreements or Partnerships:**  
  The U.S. should explore opportunities for new trade agreements that focus on sectors such as technology, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture. These partnerships could stimulate economic growth and address Panama's diversification needs.

  The geopolitical landscape in Central America is complex, with ongoing conflicts and tensions. Panama's stability is affected by the influence of neighboring countries, particularly in relation to drug trafficking and organized crime. The U.S. must remain engaged in supporting Panama's security efforts while addressing regional challenges.

* **Terrorism, Cybersecurity, and Military Escalation Risks:**  
  Emerging threats such as cybercrime and the potential for military escalations due to gang violence must be addressed proactively. Strengthening Panama's cybersecurity infrastructure and enhancing military cooperation can mitigate these risks.

**Social & Cultural Dynamics:**

* **Migration, Cultural Exchange, and Public Opinion:**  
  Migration trends have become increasingly pronounced, with many Panamanians seeking opportunities abroad. The U.S. should foster cultural exchange programs and initiatives that promote mutual understanding and strengthen ties between the two countries.

* **Shared or Divergent Societal Values:**

* Encouraging sustainable development and technological cooperation.

**Public Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**  
Panama's public health system has faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing gaps in healthcare infrastructure and access. The U.S. should collaborate with Panama to strengthen its public health system, enhance vaccine distribution capabilities, and support research partnerships. This cooperation can be achieved through targeted funding and technical assistance, ultimately improving health outcomes for both nations.

**Migration, Refugees, and Border Management:**  
Panama serves as a transit country for many migrants heading to the U.S., leading to increased pressure on its border management systems. The U.S. should work with Panama to establish humanitarian response frameworks that address refugee needs while ensuring secure borders. This cooperation can help stabilize the region and alleviate migration pressures.

***Corruption, Governance, and Institutional Transparency:***  
Addressing corruption and promoting good governance in Panama is essential for strengthening bilateral ties. The U.S. should support initiatives aimed at enhancing judicial independence and institutional transparency, fostering a more robust partnership that prioritizes democratic values.

***Regional Multilateral Engagement and International Institutions:***  
Panama's active participation in regional organizations presents opportunities for collaborative efforts to address shared challenges. The U.S. should leverage these platforms to promote multilateral cooperation and conflict resolution strategies.

***Human Rights and Social Justice Beyond Governance:***  
The U.S. must emphasize the importance of human rights, labor rights, and gender equality in its engagement with Panama. Supporting initiatives that promote social justice will not only enhance bilateral relations but also contribute to a more stable and equitable society in Panama.

**Tariff Report:**

As of 2023, Panama has a relatively open trade regime with the U.S., with tariffs generally low under the CAFTA agreement. However, specific goods may face tariffs that could be addressed through continued negotiation for trade facilitation.

**Immigration to the USA Report:**

Panama has seen a steady flow of migration to the U.S., with individuals seeking better economic opportunities and security. The U.S. should work with Panama to address the root causes of migration while ensuring humane treatment of migrants.

**Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens to Visit:**

U.S. citizens can travel to Panama without a visa for stays of up to 180 days. However, they must present a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and, in some cases, proof of sufficient funds for their stay.
