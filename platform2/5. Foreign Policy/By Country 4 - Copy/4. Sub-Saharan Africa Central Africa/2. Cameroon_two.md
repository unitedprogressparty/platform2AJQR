**Cameroon: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### Preface

Cameroon, located in Central Africa, has a complex relationship with the United States characterized by both cooperation and tension. Recently, the U.S. has expressed concern over the ongoing civil conflict in the English-speaking regions, where separatist movements have led to significant humanitarian crises. The U.S. aims to encourage the Cameroonian government to engage in dialogue with separatist groups and address human rights violations that have occurred during the conflict. While the country remains a strategic partner in regional security, particularly in counterterrorism efforts against Boko Haram, the U.S. must also navigate the delicate balance between supporting democratic reforms and addressing security concerns.

### Crises:

Cameroon is currently facing several crises that pose significant threats to both its internal stability and regional security. The ongoing civil war in the Anglophone regions has resulted in thousands of deaths, displacement of over half a million people, and severe human rights abuses. The separatist movement, which emerged in 2016, has led to armed conflict between government forces and separatist militias. This situation has created a humanitarian emergency, with widespread reports of violence against civilians, arbitrary arrests, and torture.

In addition to the civil conflict, Cameroon is grappling with the threat of Boko Haram, a terrorist group that has carried out attacks in the northern regions. This ongoing insurgency has not only destabilized the area but has also led to an increase in the number of internally displaced persons. The Cameroonian military's response to Boko Haram has been criticized for human rights abuses, complicating the U.S.'s position in supporting counterterrorism efforts while advocating for human rights.

Looking ahead, the risk of further escalation in the Anglophone crisis remains high. As separatist factions become more entrenched, the potential for violent conflict to spread to other regions increases. Additionally, the economic ramifications of these crises, including the disruption of trade and agriculture, could lead to broader regional instability. The U.S. must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing these challenges to foster a more stable Cameroon.

Moreover, the socio-economic impacts of climate change, such as food insecurity and resource scarcity, could exacerbate existing tensions and lead to new conflicts. The U.S. should prioritize support for climate resilience initiatives to mitigate these risks and promote sustainable development in Cameroon.

**Frank Narrative**

The United States expects Cameroon to play a pivotal role in achieving regional stability and security, particularly in the context of counterterrorism efforts against Boko Haram. Historically, Cameroon has been a key ally in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad Basin, providing troops for multinational forces. The U.S. seeks to enhance this collaboration by offering military training and assistance while urging the Cameroonian government to adopt human rights-centered approaches in its counterterrorism strategy. Future cooperation could involve joint intelligence-sharing initiatives and capacity-building programs that prioritize human rights.

In addition to security collaboration, the United States values Cameroon's resources, particularly in energy and agriculture, as critical components of regional stability. The U.S. has an interest in diversifying its energy sources and reducing dependence on oil from politically unstable regions. By fostering investments in renewable energy projects and sustainable agricultural practices, the U.S. can help Cameroon enhance its energy security while addressing domestic economic challenges. Future initiatives should focus on technological assistance and partnerships that promote environmental sustainability.

Cameroon, in turn, seeks support from the U.S. in addressing its internal challenges, particularly in governance and economic development. The Cameroonian government is under pressure to implement democratic reforms and improve human rights practices, especially in light of international scrutiny over its handling of the Anglophone crisis. U.S. engagement in promoting good governance and supporting civil society organizations can facilitate this process. Moreover, economic diversification efforts supported by the U.S. can help reduce Cameroon’s reliance on oil revenues and build a more resilient economy.

Finally, the U.S. and Cameroon share common interests in promoting regional stability in Central Africa. As the region faces challenges from violent extremism, climate change, and political instability, both nations can benefit from enhanced diplomatic engagement and multilateral cooperation. The U.S. can leverage its influence to encourage Cameroon to take a more active role in regional organizations and peacekeeping efforts, thereby strengthening its position as a key player in Central African geopolitics.

### 1. Overview

**Country Profile:**

Cameroon is a Central African nation bordered by Nigeria, Chad, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. It has a population of approximately 27 million people and a GDP of around $39 billion, with a per capita income of about $1,500. The country exhibits a diverse political landscape, with a presidential republic system currently led by President Paul Biya, who has been in power since 1982. Although Cameroon is rich in resources, including oil, timber, and agricultural products, it faces significant challenges related to governance, human rights, and economic stability.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Cameroon's strategic location at the crossroads of Central and West Africa makes it crucial for regional security and trade. The country serves as a hub for transportation and trade routes, providing access to landlocked countries such as Chad and the Central African Republic. The U.S. has vested interests in ensuring stability in Cameroon to prevent the spillover of terrorism and unrest into neighboring countries. Additionally, Cameroon’s energy resources and agricultural potential contribute to U.S. energy security and food supply chains.

**Democracy Score:**

Cameroon has a mixed democracy score, characterized by a dominant ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), which maintains tight control over political processes. While the constitution guarantees certain democratic rights, in practice, political repression, limited press freedoms, and corrupt practices undermine true democratic governance. The ruling party's grip on power has led to widespread discontent, particularly among Anglophone communities seeking greater autonomy. The U.S. has an interest in promoting democratic reforms and supporting civil society to enhance governance and human rights.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**

The U.S.-Cameroon relationship has evolved over decades, marked by both cooperation and tension. In 1960, Cameroon gained independence from France and has since maintained a strategic partnership with the U.S. In the 1990s, the U.S. supported Cameroon’s transition to multiparty democracy. However, the relationship has faced challenges due to human rights violations and governance issues.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**

Bilateral relations have included military cooperation, trade agreements, and humanitarian assistance. The U.S. has provided support for Cameroon’s efforts to combat Boko Haram through training and funding. However, the U.S. has also expressed concerns over the Cameroonian government’s response to the Anglophone crisis, which has strained relations. Moving forward, it is essential to balance security cooperation with advocacy for human rights and governance reforms.
