# **Saudi Arabia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Saudi Arabia have maintained a complex relationship that has evolved over decades, marked by mutual interests in security, energy, and political stability. Recently, the relationship has been redefined by Saudi Arabia's attempts to assert itself as a regional leader, particularly in light of the ongoing tensions with Iran and the normalization of relations with Israel. Additionally, the U.S. has been engaging Saudi Arabia in discussions regarding its human rights record and the war in Yemen, both of which present significant challenges. As the U.S. navigates its foreign policy objectives, it must balance its strategic interests with the pressing need for reforms in Saudi Arabia.

### **Crises:**

Saudi Arabia currently faces several crises that impact both its domestic stability and regional influence. The ongoing conflict in Yemen, which has created a humanitarian disaster, continues to strain relations with the U.S. and other Western nations. Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen has drawn criticism for exacerbating the humanitarian situation and raising concerns about human rights violations. Additionally, the potential for increased violence from Houthi rebels, who have launched missile attacks into Saudi territory, poses an ongoing security threat.

The kingdom is also navigating a complex internal landscape characterized by socio-economic challenges and demands for reform. The Vision 2030 initiative, aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing dependence on oil, has faced hurdles, including socio-political resistance and the impact of global economic fluctuations. Youth unemployment remains a pressing issue, and the challenges of modernizing a conservative society are compounded by public demands for increased freedoms and rights.

Regionally, the threat from Iran and its proxies remains a significant concern for Saudi Arabia. The recent rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, brokered by China, raises questions about the future of their rivalry and the implications for U.S. interests in the region. Additionally, the shifting dynamics in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and relations with neighboring countries, such as Qatar, highlight the fragility of regional alliances in the face of external pressures.

Looking ahead, the risks of internal unrest cannot be overlooked. Economic pressures, alongside ongoing human rights issues, could fuel dissent among the population, particularly among younger Saudis who are increasingly vocal about their aspirations for political and social reforms. The U.S. must remain vigilant in monitoring these dynamics to effectively engage with Saudi Arabia on shared interests.

**Frank Narrative**

Saudi Arabia has historically served as a critical ally to the United States in the Middle East, primarily due to its vast oil reserves and strategic geopolitical positioning. The kingdom has been a key player in stabilizing global oil markets and facilitating energy security for the U.S. and its allies. In recent years, however, the relationship has faced challenges, particularly in light of rising tensions in the region. Saudi Arabia's military involvement in Yemen has drawn international scrutiny, raising questions about the U.S.'s continued support amidst humanitarian crises. The U.S. must navigate this delicate situation while advocating for greater transparency and accountability from Saudi leadership.

In terms of counterterrorism, Saudi Arabia has been a crucial partner, providing intelligence and logistical support in the fight against extremist groups. The kingdom has made strides in its domestic counterterrorism efforts, which have significantly reduced the threat of domestic attacks. Moving forward, the U.S. must encourage Saudi Arabia to enhance its efforts in combating the underlying causes of extremism, including socio-economic disparities and ideological radicalization. By fostering a cooperative relationship, the U.S. can help Saudi Arabia address these challenges while ensuring regional stability.

The U.S. also has a vested interest in Saudi Arabia's efforts to diversify its economy through the Vision 2030 initiative. As the country seeks to reduce its reliance on oil, there are opportunities for American businesses to invest in various sectors, including technology, tourism, and renewable energy. The U.S. should actively promote partnerships and investments that align with Saudi Arabiaâ€™s vision, thereby fostering economic growth while advancing American economic interests in the region.

As the U.S. engages with Saudi Arabia, it must also prioritize human rights and governance issues. The ongoing crackdown on dissent, restrictions on freedom of expression, and the treatment of women and minorities are areas where the U.S. can exert influence. By promoting human rights and supporting reform initiatives, the U.S. can help create a more stable and prosperous Saudi Arabia that aligns with American values and interests.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Saudi Arabia is located in the Middle East, occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. It has a population of approximately 35 million people and is known for its vast oil reserves, which are the backbone of its economy. The Kingdom operates under an absolute monarchy, with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud currently at the helm. The country's GDP is heavily influenced by oil exports, with fluctuations in global oil prices significantly impacting economic indicators. Saudi Arabia ranks low on various freedom indices, reflecting restrictions on political expression, freedom of the press, and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Saudi Arabia plays a pivotal role in global energy markets as one of the largest oil producers and exporters. Its location in the Gulf region also makes it strategically important for U.S. military operations and counterterrorism efforts. The kingdom's political stance, particularly its opposition to Iran's influence in the region, aligns with U.S. interests in promoting stability and countering extremism.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Saudi Arabia is characterized by the dominance of the ruling family and limited political pluralism. While there have been attempts at reform, such as allowing women to drive and increased participation in municipal elections, significant challenges remain regarding governance practices and democratic freedoms. The current ruling party is the Saudi royal family, with King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, driving policy decisions.

**Historical Context:**

- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:** The U.S.-Saudi relationship began in the 1930s with the discovery of oil and the establishment of diplomatic ties. Significant events include the 1973 oil crisis, the Gulf War in the 1990s, and the post-9/11 era, where Saudi Arabia's role in combating terrorism became a focal point.
- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:** The 2005 Saudi-U.S. bilateral cooperation agreement solidified ties in defense and counterterrorism. However, the U.S. has faced criticism for its support amid Saudi involvement in Yemen and human rights violations. Relations have become strained over differing approaches to regional conflicts and governance issues.
