### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The United States and Kuwait have maintained a strong bilateral relationship since Kuwait’s independence in 1961. This partnership was significantly solidified during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 when the U.S. led a coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. Recently, Kuwait has been a vital ally in the region, cooperating with the U.S. on various fronts, including counterterrorism efforts, military operations, and energy security. The two nations have engaged in numerous joint military exercises and collaborations aimed at enhancing regional stability and security. In 2023, Kuwait reaffirmed its commitment to working with the U.S. to address common security threats, particularly regarding the rising influences of Iran in the region.

### **Crises**:

Kuwait faces several challenges, both internally and regionally. One significant crisis is the ongoing geopolitical tension with Iran, which poses a threat to Kuwait's security and stability. Iran's influence in the region and its support for proxy groups raise concerns for Kuwait, which has a large Shiite population. The possibility of spillover from conflicts in neighboring Iraq and Syria also remains a persistent risk. Additionally, Kuwait’s economy, heavily reliant on oil, has been affected by fluctuating global oil prices and the need for economic diversification. The government has initiated reforms to address these issues, but progress has been slow.

Another crisis is the internal political tensions, which often manifest in public protests and parliamentary gridlock. There have been frequent clashes between the parliament and the ruling family, leading to a challenging governance environment. The ongoing struggle between pro-reform factions and traditionalists complicates the political landscape and can hinder effective policymaking. The country is also grappling with youth unemployment, which has fueled discontent among the younger population.

Kuwait has also experienced environmental crises, particularly with regard to oil spills and air pollution, which have raised concerns about public health and environmental degradation. The government has been criticized for its slow response to these issues, leading to public dissatisfaction. Furthermore, Kuwait's commitment to climate change initiatives has been questioned, as its economy continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels.

Looking ahead, the potential for increased regional instability remains a concern. The rise of militant groups and the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria could lead to a resurgence of violence in the region, impacting Kuwait's security landscape. Additionally, the need for economic reform and diversification remains critical, as the country faces the long-term consequences of climate change and resource depletion. As Kuwait navigates these crises, the role of the U.S. in providing support and fostering stability will be crucial.

**Frank Narrative** 

Kuwait has proven itself to be a significant ally for the United States in the Middle East, particularly in efforts to counter terrorism and ensure regional security. The country has actively participated in coalition operations, sharing intelligence and resources that have bolstered U.S. military objectives. Kuwait's strategic location in the Gulf makes it an essential partner for the U.S. in efforts to maintain stability and freedom of navigation in critical maritime routes. Furthermore, Kuwait's cooperation in combating extremist ideologies and countering Iran’s influence aligns with U.S. interests.

In the future, the U.S. would like Kuwait to take a more prominent role in regional security initiatives, particularly in multilateral frameworks that include Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) partners. The U.S. is keen on seeing Kuwait increase its defense spending and capabilities to address security threats independently. Additionally, enhancing cooperation in counterterrorism operations and intelligence sharing would further cement Kuwait's role as a key ally in the region. By reinforcing Kuwait's military capabilities, the U.S. can help ensure that Kuwait remains a stable partner in the face of ongoing regional tensions.

Kuwait, on the other hand, requires continued U.S. support to address its domestic challenges, particularly in economic diversification and governance reforms. The country is seeking assistance in transitioning from an oil-dependent economy to one that embraces technology and innovation. U.S. investments and partnerships in sectors such as renewable energy, education, and healthcare can significantly bolster Kuwait's efforts to create a more sustainable and resilient economy. Furthermore, promoting good governance and transparency is essential for Kuwait to maintain stability and foster public trust in its institutions.

The relationship between the U.S. and Kuwait, therefore, is mutually beneficial, as both nations have distinct goals that align with each other. By fostering a collaborative approach to security, economic development, and governance, the U.S. can help Kuwait navigate its current challenges while also ensuring that its strategic interests in the region are safeguarded.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**
