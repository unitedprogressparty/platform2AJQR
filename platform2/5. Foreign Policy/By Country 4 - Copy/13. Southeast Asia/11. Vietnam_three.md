**Vietnam: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The United States and Vietnam share a complex relationship characterized by a history of conflict followed by a gradual normalization and strengthening of ties. Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, diplomatic relations were formally established in 1995, which has since evolved into a comprehensive partnership focused on trade, security, and regional stability. Recent events have seen Vietnam becoming an increasingly critical player in countering China's influence in the South China Sea, with the U.S. supporting Vietnam's claims to territorial waters and promoting joint military exercises. The Biden administration has emphasized the importance of Vietnam in its Indo-Pacific strategy, particularly in light of supply chain resilience and economic diversification efforts.

### **Crises**:

Vietnam currently faces several crises, both domestically and regionally. Domestically, the country is grappling with the impacts of climate change, particularly rising sea levels that threaten its extensive coastline. The Mekong Delta, which is vital for agriculture, is at risk, leading to potential food security issues. Regionally, tensions in the South China Sea remain high, with Vietnam contesting China's extensive territorial claims and militarization of artificial islands. This situation creates a precarious balance of power in Southeast Asia, with the potential for conflict impacting the U.S. interests in maintaining freedom of navigation and regional stability.

Another significant crisis is the ongoing struggle for human rights and political freedoms in Vietnam. The government's tight grip on dissent and freedom of expression has led to widespread criticism from international human rights organizations. The U.S. is increasingly vocal about these issues, indicating that progress in human rights could be linked to the strengthening of bilateral relations. Economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have also affected Vietnam’s growth trajectory, highlighting vulnerabilities in its healthcare system and economic dependence on global supply chains.

Looking to the future, potential crises could arise from internal political instability or economic challenges exacerbated by global shifts, such as the ongoing effects of climate change and the need for economic diversification. The risk of civil unrest due to economic disparities or environmental degradation is a concern that could impact Vietnam's governance and stability.

**Frank Narrative** 

Vietnam is positioned as a crucial ally for the United States in Southeast Asia, particularly in the context of countering China's assertiveness in the region. The U.S. seeks to leverage Vietnam's strategic location and growing military capabilities to enhance regional security frameworks and promote stability in the South China Sea. Vietnam's cooperation in joint military exercises and information sharing is pivotal to these efforts. In the future, the U.S. hopes to deepen military ties through arms sales, joint training initiatives, and further integration into regional security dialogues.

Moreover, Vietnam can contribute significantly to U.S. economic interests through its role as a manufacturing hub and a key player in supply chain diversification. The ongoing trade relationship, bolstered by the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement, provides opportunities for both nations to strengthen economic ties. The U.S. is particularly interested in Vietnam's participation in trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which aims to enhance trade liberalization and economic cooperation in the region.

In terms of addressing domestic challenges, Vietnam requires support from the U.S. in areas such as technological advancement and environmental sustainability. As the country faces the impacts of climate change, U.S. assistance in renewable energy projects and disaster preparedness could significantly benefit Vietnam's resilience. Furthermore, economic diversification efforts are essential for reducing dependency on certain industries, and U.S. investment could help foster growth in emerging sectors.

Lastly, the U.S. must continue to advocate for human rights and democratic governance in Vietnam. By linking economic cooperation and trade benefits to human rights improvements, the U.S. can encourage Vietnam to adopt more progressive policies while also enhancing bilateral relations. The expectation is that as Vietnam continues to develop, it will align more closely with U.S. values, creating a partnership that is both economically beneficial and politically stable.
