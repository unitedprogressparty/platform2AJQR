# **Sweden: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Kingdom of Sweden share a deep and enduring partnership based on shared democratic values, strong economic ties, a commitment to multilateralism and human rights, and increasingly close security cooperation. Historically non-aligned militarily, Sweden fundamentally shifted its security policy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, applying for and achieving **NATO membership in March 2024**. This historic step has significantly deepened the U.S.-Sweden strategic relationship. Sweden is a leading member of the European Union, known for its innovation, commitment to development aid, and active role in international diplomacy, particularly on issues like climate change, disarmament, and conflict resolution. Current relations are **excellent, marked by Sweden's integration into NATO**, close coordination on supporting Ukraine, alignment on countering Russian aggression, and cooperation on global challenges. The U.S. strongly supported Sweden's NATO accession and views it as a highly capable ally strengthening transatlantic security, particularly in the Baltic Sea region and the High North.

### **Crises**

The primary crisis impacting Sweden is the **regional security crisis** precipitated by Russia's aggression against Ukraine and its broader challenge to the European security order. This prompted Sweden's historic decision to abandon centuries of military non-alignment and join NATO. Adjusting to its new role as a NATO ally, integrating its forces into Alliance structures, and contributing to collective deterrence against Russia are key ongoing tasks within this crisis context. Relatedly, Sweden faces heightened risks from **Russian hybrid warfare**, including disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, espionage, and potential provocations in the Baltic Sea region or the Arctic. Maintaining societal resilience and enhancing capabilities to counter these threats are crucial.

Domestically, Sweden has faced challenges related to the **integration of large numbers of immigrants and refugees** received over recent decades, leading to social tensions and challenges in certain urban areas, including issues with organized crime and gang violence, which has become a significant political concern. While Sweden remains a stable democracy, managing these integration and security challenges is an ongoing focus.

Economically, Sweden, like other European nations, has dealt with **inflationary pressures** and energy price volatility following the war in Ukraine, though its economy remains robust. Ensuring long-term **energy security** and managing the **green transition** of its industry (e.g., steel production) are important economic challenges.

Anticipated future crises revolve mainly around the **regional security environment**. Potential escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, further Russian aggression or provocations in the Baltic Sea or Arctic regions, or intensified hybrid threats against Sweden or its neighbors (Finland, Baltics) pose significant risks. Maintaining NATO unity and deterrence, strengthening national defense, and enhancing societal resilience are key mitigation strategies. Domestically, failure to effectively manage integration challenges or gang violence could lead to social instability, although the democratic system is strong. **Climate change impacts** (e.g., on forests, Arctic environment) also represent a long-term challenge.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Sweden, now as a NATO ally, is poised to significantly enhance its contributions to U.S. regional and global goals. Historically, even as a non-aligned partner, Sweden played a valuable role. It has been a strong **advocate for democracy, human rights, and multilateralism**, often aligning with U.S. positions in international forums and providing substantial **development and humanitarian aid** globally, supporting U.S. goals of promoting stability and prosperity. Sweden possesses a **highly advanced defense industry** (e.g., Saab producing Gripen fighters, submarines, radar systems) and sophisticated, albeit relatively small, armed forces that maintained high levels of interoperability with NATO even before accession, frequently participating in NATO exercises. Sweden has contributed forces to international **peacekeeping and crisis management operations** (e.g., in Afghanistan, Mali historically, Kosovo). Its location provides strategic depth in the **Baltic Sea region** and the **High North/Arctic**, areas of increasing geopolitical importance. Sweden has also been a key partner in **scientific research and technological innovation**, collaborating with the U.S. in various fields. Since 2022, Sweden has been a staunch **supporter of Ukraine**, providing significant military (including advanced systems like Archer artillery, CV90 infantry fighting vehicles) and financial aid, fully aligning with U.S. policy.

Looking forward, Sweden's **NATO membership** dramatically increases its potential contributions. The U.S. expects Sweden to fully integrate its formidable military capabilities into NATO defense plans, significantly strengthening **deterrence and defense on the eastern flank**, particularly in the Baltic Sea region (where its navy and air force are highly capable) and the High North. Continued commitment to high levels of **defense spending** (reaching/exceeding 2% GDP) and modernization is crucial. Sweden's advanced **defense technology** can benefit the Alliance. The U.S. seeks continued strong **support for Ukraine** and close coordination within NATO and the EU on policies towards Russia. Sweden's role as a **leader in innovation and green technology** can help advance transatlantic goals on climate change and energy transition. Its strong commitment to **democratic values and multilateralism** makes it a key partner in upholding the rules-based international order and countering authoritarian influence globally. Concrete actions could include Sweden taking lead roles in specific NATO maritime or air policing missions in the Baltic, hosting NATO exercises, contributing expertise on Arctic security, co-leading initiatives on green defense technology, and continuing its strong diplomatic advocacy for democracy and human rights. Accountability is maintained through NATO defense planning, bilateral defense consultations, and coordination within EU/G7/Nordic-Baltic formats.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a new NATO ally adapting to a changed security environment, Sweden's primary need is the **full realization of NATO's collective defense guarantees (Article 5)** and seamless integration into Alliance structures. This includes clear U.S. commitment to Baltic Sea regional security and the High North. Sweden needs close **defense and security cooperation** with the U.S. and key allies (UK, Germany, Nordics, Baltics) to enhance interoperability, participate fully in NATO planning and exercises, and potentially acquire specific enabling capabilities (e.g., advanced ISR, air/missile defense integration). Continued robust **intelligence sharing** regarding regional threats (Russia, hybrid warfare) is vital.

Economically, Sweden needs a **stable and open global trading system** for its export-oriented economy (machinery, vehicles, tech, pharmaceuticals, timber/paper). It benefits from strong **transatlantic trade and investment** and relies on the smooth functioning of the **EU single market**. U.S. policies supporting free trade, avoiding protectionism (especially U.S.-EU disputes), and upholding multilateral trade rules (WTO) are important. Sweden also needs international cooperation on **climate change** and support for its ambitious **green transition** goals (e.g., green steel production), requiring access to technology, finance, and international carbon pricing mechanisms.

Diplomatically, Sweden needs continued **U.S. engagement and leadership in European security** and support for **multilateralism** and international law. It seeks partnership in addressing global challenges (climate, health, development) through international institutions. Support for **Ukraine's sovereignty and defense** remains a critical shared need requiring sustained international solidarity and burden-sharing. Sweden also benefits from international cooperation in managing regional challenges like **Baltic Sea security** and **Arctic governance**. Finally, support for its efforts to **counter disinformation and hybrid threats**, including sharing best practices and intelligence, is an important need.

## 4. Impact of Trump’s Second Term on Bilateral Relations

*(Note: This section analyzes hypothetical impacts based on general Trump administration tendencies, as a second term did not occur.)*

- A hypothetical second Trump term could have created significant challenges, particularly regarding **NATO commitment**. Trump's rhetoric questioning Article 5 or demanding increased burden-sharing could have deeply concerned Sweden, especially as a new ally relying on collective defense guarantees.
- Potential U.S. withdrawal from climate agreements or imposition of trade tariffs on EU could have caused major friction, given Sweden's strong stances on these issues. Skepticism towards multilateralism would clash with Swedish foreign policy tradition.
- Impact could have been strained relations, potentially undermining confidence in U.S. security commitments and pushing Sweden towards closer European defense cooperation as a hedge, though shared concerns about Russia would likely maintain a baseline security partnership.

## 5. Restoring Bilateral Relations and Revitalizing Agricultural Partnerships

- To restore relations post-hypothetical Trump term, the U.S. should **immediately reaffirm ironclad commitment to NATO Article 5** and Baltic/Arctic security. Re-engage fully with EU/NATO allies. Prioritize multilateralism and climate action (rejoin Paris Agreement). Resolve trade disputes with EU amicably.
