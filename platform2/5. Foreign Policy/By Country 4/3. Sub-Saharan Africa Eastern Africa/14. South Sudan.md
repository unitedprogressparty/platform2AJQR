### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The relationship between the United States and South Sudan has evolved since the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The U.S. was instrumental in supporting South Sudan's independence through diplomatic efforts and humanitarian assistance during the prolonged civil war in Sudan. However, the relationship has faced challenges, particularly following the outbreak of civil war in South Sudan in 2013, which has led to significant internal strife and humanitarian crises. Recent events, including peace agreements and ongoing tensions between rival factions, have kept the U.S. engaged in efforts to promote stability and humanitarian assistance in the region.

### **Crises**:

South Sudan is currently grappling with multiple crises, including ongoing conflict, humanitarian emergencies, and economic instability. The civil war that erupted in 2013 has continued to create a humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating a dire need for food and medical assistance. Despite the signing of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) in 2018, sporadic violence persists, particularly in areas where ethnic tensions remain high. Additionally, the economic situation is precarious, with inflation rates soaring and a reliance on oil revenues that has been affected by fluctuating global oil prices.

The broader region is also facing challenges that affect South Sudan's stability. Neighboring countries, including Sudan and Ethiopia, are dealing with their own political conflicts and economic issues, which can spill over into South Sudan. The interconnections between these nations mean that a resolution in South Sudan is contingent upon broader regional stability. The presence of armed groups and rebel factions poses a continuing threat to peace efforts, and the potential for renewed conflict remains a significant concern for both the U.S. and international community.

As the U.S. navigates its foreign policy in South Sudan, it must consider the implications of these crises not only for bilateral relations but also for regional security. The humanitarian situation demands urgent attention, with millions of people in need of assistance. The U.S. must balance its support for peace negotiations with the need to address the immediate needs of South Sudan's population to prevent further destabilization and potential conflict.

Looking forward, there are risks associated with the potential resurgence of violence due to unmet expectations from the peace process. The possibility of internal dissent and the emergence of new rebel groups is a concern. The U.S. must remain vigilant and adaptable in its approach to South Sudan, ensuring that it supports democratic governance while addressing the root causes of conflict and instability.

**Frank Narrative** 

The United States has a vested interest in South Sudan due to its strategic location in East Africa and the ongoing humanitarian crises stemming from civil conflict. The U.S. has historically supported peace initiatives and humanitarian relief efforts to stabilize the region. South Sudan can assist the U.S. in achieving its regional goals by being a partner in counterterrorism efforts, given the potential for extremist groups to exploit the instability in the country. Additionally, South Sudan's oil resources are significant, and a stable South Sudan could contribute to energy security in the region. The U.S. would like to see South Sudan move toward a more stable and democratic governance structure, which is essential for sustainable development and regional cooperation.

In the future, the U.S. hopes to work with South Sudan to foster economic diversification beyond oil dependence and to strengthen governance institutions. The ongoing peace process must be supported through financial and technical assistance to ensure that the government can deliver basic services and maintain order. The U.S. can leverage its influence in international forums to garner support for South Sudan's development initiatives, which is crucial for long-term stability.

South Sudan needs the United States' support in several areas, including humanitarian assistance, economic development, and capacity building for governance. The U.S. can play a pivotal role in addressing the dire humanitarian needs through financial aid and logistical support for relief efforts. Furthermore, technological assistance in agriculture and education can help South Sudan diversify its economy, reduce reliance on oil, and promote sustainable development.

The U.S. can foster cooperation by emphasizing shared values of democracy, human rights, and good governance while providing the necessary resources and expertise to support South Sudan's development. Collaborative efforts could lead to improved governance, reduced corruption, and greater transparency, ultimately enhancing bilateral relations and regional stability.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

South Sudan is located in East-Central Africa, bordered by Sudan to the north, Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the south, Uganda to the southwest, and the Central African Republic to the west. The country has a population of approximately 11 million people, with Juba as its capital. South Sudan's political system is a presidential republic, but it has faced significant challenges due to internal conflict. The economy heavily relies on oil exports, which account for over 90% of government revenue. According to the World Bank, South Sudan's GDP was estimated at $3.2 billion in 2021, with a high degree of poverty and low quality of life indicators, including health care and education. The Freedom House score indicates that South Sudan is not free, with severe restrictions on civil liberties and political rights.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

South Sudan's strategic location is critical for regional stability in East Africa. The country is rich in natural resources, particularly oil, and its stability is essential for ensuring energy security for the U.S. and its allies. Additionally, South Sudan's ongoing conflicts have implications for neighboring countries, potentially leading to regional instability. The U.S. has a strong interest in promoting peace, stability, and good governance in South Sudan to prevent the spread of violence and humanitarian crises that could affect the broader region.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in South Sudan is characterized by authoritarian governance, with President Salva Kiir and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) maintaining power. The ruling party has faced criticism for human rights abuses, suppression of dissent, and lack of political pluralism. While there have been attempts to establish a coalition government following the peace agreement, real governance practices often diverge from official structures, leading to a lack of democratic freedoms. The country currently ranks poorly on democracy indices, with significant challenges to political participation and civil liberties.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
The U.S. played a key role in South Sudan's independence, providing support during the Second Sudanese Civil War and advocating for a peace agreement in 2005. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) laid the groundwork for South Sudan's self-determination referendum in 2011. However, the subsequent outbreak of civil war in 2013 strained relations, as the U.S. condemned the violence and called for accountability.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
The U.S. has been involved in various agreements aimed at promoting peace and stability in South Sudan, including the R-ARCSS in 2018. However, the relationship has been tested by ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises, leading to increased scrutiny of the government's actions. Bilateral relations are currently strained due to human rights concerns and the slow progress of the peace process.
