# **Sudan: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Sudan has been a focal point of U.S. foreign policy in Africa, particularly due to its complex history of conflict, governance issues, and strategic location in the Horn of Africa. The U.S. has sought to engage with Sudan following the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, which opened avenues for reform and a potential partnership. In recent months, however, Sudan has faced escalating violence and instability, particularly with the ongoing clashes between military factions and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This situation complicates U.S. interests in counterterrorism, humanitarian relief, and regional stability.

### **Crises**

Sudan is currently facing a severe humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF, which erupted in April 2023. This has led to widespread violence, displacement of over 5 million people, and a dire need for humanitarian assistance. The clashes have not only affected civilians but have also threatened the fragile political transition toward democracy that began in 2019. Additionally, the ongoing crisis has led to concerns over potential spillover effects into neighboring countries, particularly South Sudan, which remains vulnerable to instability.

The region is also grappling with food insecurity due to the combined effects of conflict, climate change, and economic mismanagement. According to the World Food Programme, approximately 18 million people in Sudan are facing acute food shortages. This situation is compounded by rising tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Ethiopia, over shared resources like the Nile River, which could lead to further regional instability.

Moreover, Sudan continues to be at risk of internal violence stemming from ethnic tensions and tribal conflicts, particularly in regions like Darfur. The historical grievances and lack of governance in these areas have created fertile ground for rebel activity, which poses a significant challenge to peace efforts and regional security.

Looking to the future, the potential for renewed violence or civil war remains a pressing concern. The U.S. must navigate these complexities carefully, balancing the need for humanitarian assistance with the imperative to support a stable and democratic Sudan.

**Frank Narrative**

Sudan's strategic significance to the United States lies in its geographic location and the potential for fostering regional stability. The U.S. has expressed interest in supporting Sudan's transition to democracy, which could serve as a model for other nations in the region. Sudan has also been pivotal in counterterrorism efforts, particularly in addressing threats from extremist groups in the Sahel and surrounding regions. Moving forward, the U.S. could leverage Sudan’s position to enhance cooperation in intelligence sharing and counterterrorism operations, which are vital for both nations' security interests.

In addition, Sudan's natural resources, including oil and minerals, present opportunities for economic collaboration. The U.S. could assist Sudan in diversifying its economy, which has historically depended on oil exports. By investing in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and technology sectors, both countries could benefit economically. Furthermore, the U.S. could support Sudan in implementing reforms that attract foreign investment, fostering a more stable and prosperous economy that aligns with U.S. interests.

The humanitarian crisis in Sudan necessitates immediate action from the international community. The U.S. can play a pivotal role by providing humanitarian aid and supporting organizations working on the ground. This assistance should not only address immediate needs but also focus on long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts. By actively engaging in humanitarian initiatives, the U.S. can strengthen its relationship with the Sudanese people and promote goodwill toward American interests in the region.

Lastly, U.S. support for democratic reforms in Sudan is essential for ensuring long-term stability. The U.S. should advocate for accountability and transparency within Sudan’s government, supporting civil society organizations and promoting human rights. By fostering democratic values, the U.S. can help mitigate the risks of future conflicts and contribute to a more secure and stable Sudan.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Sudan, located in North-East Africa, shares borders with Egypt, the Red Sea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya. It has a population of approximately 46 million people and an estimated GDP of $40 billion, with significant reliance on agriculture and natural resources. The country has been grappling with substantial challenges, including high inflation, economic sanctions, and political instability, which have impacted the quality of life and led to an overall low freedom index score, ranking it 171 out of 180 countries in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**

Sudan's location and resources play a crucial role in regional and global stability. The country is a key player in the geopolitics of the Horn of Africa, with implications for security, migration, and trade routes.

Additionally, the U.S. has interests in countering extremism in the region, and Sudan's cooperation is essential in addressing the threats posed by terrorist organizations.

**Democracy Score:**

The political landscape in Sudan is characterized by a transitional government struggling to establish democratic norms following the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The ruling Sovereign Council, composed of military and civilian leaders, has faced challenges in governance, human rights, and the rule of law. While there have been efforts to implement democratic reforms, the ongoing conflict and instability hinder progress. The Sudanese Communist Party currently has a significant role in opposition politics, advocating for a more equitable government.
