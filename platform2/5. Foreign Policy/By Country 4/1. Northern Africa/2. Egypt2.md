**Egypt: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

### **Preface**

The United States and Egypt maintain a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty and reinforced by annual U.S. assistance of approximately \$1.53 billion. In April 2025, Cairo and Washington signed a \$235 million rail‑modernization contract to upgrade locomotives and expand trade capacity, demonstrating deep economic collaboration amid challenges in Gaza and Sinai security.

### **Crises**

1. **Economic Strain & Inflation.** Annual inflation peaked at 38% in September 2023 and declined to 13.6% by March 2025. Real wages remain pressured despite a 225 bp rate cut by the Central Bank on April 17, 2025, necessitating targeted fiscal relief and social‑safety‑net support.

2. **Sinai Insurgency & Border Security.** ISIS‑affiliated militants in North Sinai continue low‑level attacks. Egypt has reinforced troop deployments along the Philadelphi Corridor, balancing Treaty obligations with Israel against cross‑border threat mitigation.

3. **Gaza Conflict Spillover.** Over 100,000 Gazan refugees in Sinai strain local infrastructure. Cairo’s \$53 billion reconstruction proposal at the March 2025 Arab summit underscores its mediator role but requires robust international financing.

4. **Debt Sustainability & IMF Conditions.** Egypt’s \$8 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility imposes stringent reforms—subsidy cuts, privatizations—that fuel social unrest and demand U.S. engagement to support inclusive growth.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**
*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

- Egypt secures the Suez‑Red Sea corridor, facilitating 10% of global trade and underpinning U.S. naval deployments. Continued cooperation deters piracy and ensures freedom of navigation.
- Cairo’s intelligence‑sharing and joint counter‑ISIS operations have degraded extremist networks in Sinai. We propose expanding cyber counterterrorism exercises and creating a “Sinai Security Task Force.”
- Egypt’s mediation in Israeli‑Palestinian ceasefires is vital. Formalizing a trilateral U.S.–Egypt–Israel Security Dialogue would institutionalize coordination on humanitarian corridors.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**
*This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.*

- Egypt requires expanded debt relief and grant financing. A “U.S.–Egypt Fiscal Support Package” could unlock \$2 billion in concessional loans tied to transparent budget execution and anti‑corruption benchmarks.
- Technical assistance for monetary‑policy institution‑building—especially at the Central Bank—would stabilize the pound and reduce inflation volatility. Establish a U.S. Treasury–Egyptian Finance working group.
- Infrastructure modernization demands both public grants and private investment. Propose a \$500 million U.S.–Egypt Infrastructure Fund co‑capitalized by DFC and Egypt’s sovereign wealth fund with job creation and carbon reduction metrics.
