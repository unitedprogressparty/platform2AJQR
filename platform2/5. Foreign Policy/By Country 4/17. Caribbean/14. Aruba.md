# **Aruba: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Aruba, a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, share a close and cooperative relationship based on geographic proximity, strong economic ties (particularly tourism), shared democratic values, and cooperation on regional security issues like counter-narcotics. As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba's foreign policy and defense are ultimately responsibilities of the Kingdom, but Aruba exercises significant autonomy in other areas. The U.S. maintains a consulate in nearby Curaçao that handles relations with the Dutch Caribbean islands, including Aruba. Current relations are **positive and focused on economic partnership (tourism), law enforcement cooperation (counter-narcotics, border security), and managing regional challenges** like migration flows from nearby Venezuela. The U.S. values Aruba as a stable, democratic, and prosperous partner in the Caribbean.

### **Crises**

Aruba faces several challenges, primarily economic and environmental, rather than acute political or security crises. Its economy is heavily **dependent on tourism** (especially from the U.S.), making it extremely vulnerable to external shocks like pandemics (as seen during COVID-19) or economic downturns affecting travel. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism remains a long-term challenge. The closure of a major oil refinery years ago also impacted the economy significantly.

Environmentally, as a small, low-lying island nation, Aruba is highly vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, particularly **sea-level rise**, coastal erosion, coral reef degradation (affecting tourism and coastal protection), and potential increases in hurricane intensity. **Water scarcity** is also a challenge, with Aruba relying heavily on desalination.

Regionally, Aruba is affected by the ongoing **crisis in nearby Venezuela**. This manifests primarily through **irregular migration flows** from Venezuela to Aruba (and neighboring Curaçao and Bonaire), straining resources and requiring cooperation on border management and humanitarian response. The instability in Venezuela also creates potential risks related to **transnational crime** (drug trafficking, smuggling) in the waters surrounding Aruba.

Anticipated future crises could include severe **economic downturns** caused by disruptions to tourism (e.g., future pandemics, major recessions, severe hurricane). Worsening **climate change impacts** could threaten coastal infrastructure and the tourism-dependent environment. A significant escalation of the **crisis in Venezuela** could lead to larger migration flows or increased regional instability impacting Aruba. Maintaining economic resilience and managing environmental vulnerabilities are key challenges.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Aruba, primarily through its relationship with the Kingdom of the Netherlands and its own capabilities, contributes to U.S. regional goals in the Caribbean mainly through **law enforcement cooperation and border security**. Aruba cooperates closely with U.S. agencies (DEA, Coast Guard, CBP) on **counter-narcotics efforts**, serving as a partner in interdicting drug shipments transiting the Caribbean towards the U.S. It participates in regional security cooperation mechanisms. The presence of a **U.S. Forward Operating Location (FOL) in nearby Curaçao** (under agreement with the Netherlands) facilitates regional counter-drug surveillance flights, indirectly benefiting security around Aruba. Aruba also cooperates on **managing irregular migration flows** from Venezuela, working with international partners (like UNHCR, IOM) and the U.S. to address the humanitarian and security aspects. As a stable, prosperous democracy, Aruba contributes to overall **Caribbean stability and economic well-being**. Its thriving **tourism sector**, heavily reliant on U.S. visitors, fosters strong people-to-people ties and economic links.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Aruba's continued strong cooperation on **counter-narcotics and maritime security**. Enhanced information sharing, participation in joint patrols or interdiction exercises (potentially involving Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard), and efforts to combat money laundering associated with trafficking would support U.S. goals. Continued effective management of **migration flows** from Venezuela, in coordination with regional partners and international organizations, is crucial. Aruba can also play a role in promoting **regional economic integration** and sharing best practices in **sustainable tourism**. As Aruba potentially explores **renewable energy** options (solar, wind), partnership in this area could contribute to regional energy transition goals. Concrete actions could include Aruba investing further in its maritime surveillance capabilities (with Dutch/U.S. support), streamlining processes for law enforcement cooperation, and actively participating in regional dialogues on migration and security. Accountability is maintained through bilateral U.S.-Kingdom of Netherlands dialogues, specific law enforcement cooperation agreements, and regional security forums.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

Aruba's primary needs from the U.S. and the international community revolve around economic resilience, security cooperation, and managing regional spillover effects. Economically, Aruba needs continued **strong tourism flows**, particularly from the U.S. market, which is the backbone of its economy. Stable U.S. economic conditions and continued ease of travel (including preclearance facilities at Aruba's airport) are vital. Support for **economic diversification** efforts beyond tourism, potentially through technical assistance or encouraging investment in niche sectors (e.g., renewable energy, logistics, potentially aloe cultivation/products), would enhance resilience.

In security, Aruba needs continued **U.S. and international cooperation on counter-narcotics and maritime security** to combat trafficking networks operating in the region. This includes intelligence sharing, technical assistance, training, and operational support (e.g., from U.S. Coast Guard, JIATF-South, Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard). Support is also needed for managing the **migration flows from Venezuela**, including humanitarian assistance for migrants/refugees hosted on the island (via UNHCR/IOM) and technical support for border management and asylum processes, recognizing the resource constraints of a small island.

Given its vulnerability, Aruba needs international support and access to finance/technology for **climate change adaptation**, particularly coastal protection, coral reef restoration, water management (desalination efficiency), and developing **renewable energy** sources to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and enhance sustainability (important for its tourism brand). U.S. support via regional climate initiatives or technical expertise (NOAA, EPA) could be valuable. Finally, Aruba benefits from continued **U.S. engagement and partnership** that recognizes its status as a stable democracy and reliable partner in the Caribbean, including through the U.S. consulate covering the Dutch Caribbean.
