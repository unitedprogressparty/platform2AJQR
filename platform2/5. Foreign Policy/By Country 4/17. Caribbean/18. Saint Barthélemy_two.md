# **Saint Barthélemy: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and Saint Barthélemy (often called St. Barts or St. Barths), an overseas collectivity of France, maintain a relationship characterized primarily by high-end tourism and economic links, within the broader context of the strong U.S.-France alliance. Located in the northeastern Caribbean, St. Barts is known as a luxury tourist destination, particularly popular with American visitors. As a French collectivity, its foreign policy and defense are responsibilities of France, although it possesses significant autonomy in other areas. U.S. engagement is managed through the U.S. Embassy in Paris and Consulate General in Martinique (covering French Caribbean territories). Current relations are **positive and low-profile**, focused on tourism, consular affairs for American citizens, and regional cooperation on issues like maritime security and disaster response, coordinated through France.

### **Crises**

Saint Barthélemy faces challenges typical of small, high-income island territories, mainly economic and environmental. Its economy is overwhelmingly **dependent on luxury tourism**, making it extremely vulnerable to external shocks like hurricanes (Hurricane Irma in 2017 caused severe damage), pandemics (COVID-19 travel restrictions), or global economic downturns affecting high-end travel. Maintaining its exclusive tourism brand while managing development pressures and ensuring resilience is a key challenge.

Environmentally, as a small island, St. Barts is vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, including **sea-level rise**, potential increases in **hurricane intensity**, and threats to its marine environment (coral reefs) and limited freshwater resources. Protecting its natural beauty, essential for tourism, requires careful environmental management and climate adaptation efforts.

Regionally, while generally stable and secure, its location makes it potentially susceptible to **transnational crime** (smuggling, illicit finance associated with luxury assets) transiting the Caribbean, requiring cooperation with French and regional law enforcement partners.

Anticipated future crises primarily revolve around **natural disasters** (hurricanes) potentially becoming more severe due to climate change, posing existential threats to its infrastructure and tourism economy. **Economic shocks** impacting luxury travel could also cause significant downturns. Maintaining its unique character and environmental quality amidst development pressures and climate change is the central long-term challenge.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Saint Barthélemy's contributions to U.S. regional goals are limited due to its small size and status as a French collectivity, but occur primarily through the framework of U.S.-France cooperation. Its main contribution is serving as a **stable, well-governed, and prosperous territory** in the Caribbean, contributing to overall regional stability. It cooperates (via France) with U.S. law enforcement on specific issues like **countering illicit finance** or potentially tracking transnational criminal activity, leveraging its position as a high-wealth destination. Its well-managed **tourism sector**, attracting significant numbers of American visitors, supports regional economic activity and people-to-people ties. Its experience in **recovering from Hurricane Irma** and rebuilding resilient infrastructure could offer lessons for regional disaster preparedness, although on a smaller scale than larger islands.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks St. Barts' continued cooperation (via France) on **law enforcement matters**, including anti-money laundering efforts and information sharing related to potential transnational crime. Its continued stability and adherence to high governance standards contribute positively to the region. Sharing best practices in **high-end sustainable tourism** and **disaster resilience** for small islands could be valuable regionally. Concrete actions are primarily managed through U.S.-France channels, focusing on information sharing and coordinated law enforcement actions when necessary.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a small, affluent island collectivity of France, Saint Barthélemy's needs from the U.S. and the world are specific. Economically, it needs continued **access for its high-end tourism market**, particularly stable travel flows from the U.S. and Europe. Maintaining its reputation for safety, exclusivity, and environmental quality is crucial.

Given its extreme vulnerability, St. Barts needs international cooperation and access to finance/technology for **climate change adaptation and disaster resilience**. This includes support (primarily via France and potentially EU mechanisms) for coastal protection, resilient infrastructure development, coral reef conservation, and potentially renewable energy solutions suitable for a small island grid. U.S. technical expertise (NOAA, FEMA) on hurricane preparedness and coastal resilience could be shared via France.

In security, St. Barts benefits from the broader regional security umbrella provided by France, the Netherlands, the UK, and the U.S. Continued international cooperation, including **U.S. Coast Guard presence and counter-narcotics efforts** in the region, helps protect its maritime environment from illicit activities. Cooperation between U.S. and French law enforcement agencies is important for addressing potential transnational crime or illicit finance issues involving the territory. Finally, St. Barts benefits from continued **U.S. consular services** (via Consulate Martinique/Embassy Paris) for the large number of American citizens who visit or reside there.
