# **Latvia: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Republic of Latvia share a strong and growing strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, a common commitment to transatlantic security through NATO, and Latvia's position as a frontline state bordering Russia and Belarus. Since regaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia has firmly anchored itself in Euro-Atlantic institutions (joining NATO and the EU in 2004). The U.S. was a steadfast supporter of Latvia's independence and its integration into these institutions. Current relations are **excellent and deeply collaborative**, particularly on defense and security matters. Russia's aggression against Ukraine has further solidified this partnership, with Latvia being a staunch supporter of Ukraine, a host to NATO's enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battlegroup (led by Canada), and a key partner in strengthening deterrence on NATO's eastern flank. Cooperation also extends to energy security, countering disinformation, promoting democratic values in the region, and economic ties.

### **Crises**

The most significant crisis impacting Latvia is the **regional security crisis** stemming from Russia's aggressive actions, particularly its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a NATO frontline state directly bordering Russia and its ally Belarus, Latvia perceives an elevated threat level and has significantly increased its defense spending and readiness. The war has underscored the importance of NATO collective defense guarantees (Article 5) and the presence of allied troops (U.S. rotational forces and the NATO eFP battlegroup) on Latvian soil. Managing this heightened security environment and deterring potential Russian aggression or hybrid threats are paramount concerns.

Relatedly, Latvia faces challenges from **Russian hybrid warfare tactics**, including disinformation campaigns targeting its population (especially the significant Russian-speaking minority), cyberattacks, and potential border provocations. Countering these threats requires ongoing vigilance and investment in societal resilience, cybersecurity, and strategic communications, often in cooperation with U.S. and NATO allies.

Economically, Latvia, like other European countries, has faced pressures from **energy price volatility** and **inflation** exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, although it has successfully diversified away from Russian energy supplies. Ensuring long-term energy security and managing the economic consequences of the regional security situation remain important challenges.

While Latvia has a stable democracy, ensuring the full **integration and social cohesion** of its Russian-speaking minority (roughly 25% of the population) remains a long-term societal challenge, potentially exploitable by external disinformation efforts. Government policies regarding language use and education for minorities have sometimes drawn international scrutiny, requiring careful management to balance national identity with minority rights protections.

Anticipated future crises primarily revolve around the **regional security landscape**. Potential escalation of the war in Ukraine, further Russian aggression or provocations against NATO allies (including Latvia or its Baltic neighbors), or intensified hybrid warfare campaigns pose significant risks. Maintaining NATO unity and deterrence, strengthening national defense capabilities, and enhancing societal resilience are key priorities for mitigating these potential crises. Economic shocks or prolonged regional instability could also impact Latvia's growth and stability.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Latvia is a crucial ally in achieving U.S. strategic goals in Northern Europe and along NATO's eastern flank. Its primary contribution is serving as a **committed frontline NATO ally**, actively participating in collective defense efforts and hosting allied forces. Latvia hosts the **NATO enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battlegroup**, led by Canada but with contributions from numerous allies including the U.S. historically, demonstrating Alliance solidarity and enhancing deterrence against Russia. Latvia has consistently increased its **defense spending**, meeting and exceeding the NATO 2% GDP target, investing in its own military capabilities (often acquiring U.S./NATO standard equipment) and developing infrastructure to support allied deployments (e.g., Lielvārde Air Base upgrades). Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Latvia has been a **staunch supporter of Ukraine**, providing significant bilateral military and financial aid relative to its size, strongly advocating for robust EU/NATO support for Kyiv, and enforcing sanctions against Russia. This aligns directly with top U.S. priorities. Latvia also plays a key role in **regional security cooperation** among the Baltic states (Lithuania, Estonia) and within Nordic-Baltic formats, coordinating defense planning and enhancing regional resilience. It hosts the **NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (StratCom COE)** in Riga, contributing vital expertise in countering disinformation and hybrid threats – a critical capability supporting U.S. and allied interests. Furthermore, Latvia serves as a strong **advocate for democratic values** and Euro-Atlantic integration in the region, supporting democratic movements in neighboring countries like Belarus when possible.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Latvia's continued strong commitment across these areas. Maintaining high levels of **defense spending** and continued **modernization of its armed forces** (enhancing interoperability with U.S./NATO) is essential. The U.S. wants Latvia to continue **hosting NATO eFP forces and rotational U.S. troops**, further improving host nation support infrastructure. Continued unwavering **political, military, and financial support for Ukraine** remains a critical shared objective. Latvia's leadership within the EU and NATO in advocating for strong policies against Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's integration path is highly valued. Enhanced cooperation in **countering hybrid threats**, leveraging the expertise of the NATO StratCom COE and strengthening national resilience (cyber defense, critical infrastructure protection, societal preparedness), is crucial. Concrete actions could include Latvia taking on niche capability roles within NATO (e.g., related to StratCom or specific drone/cyber capabilities), increasing joint training exercises focused on Baltic defense, and continuing to lead regional efforts supporting Ukrainian reconstruction or democratic forces in Belarus. Accountability is maintained through NATO defense planning, regular U.S.-Latvia bilateral defense consultations, and coordination within EU/B9 formats.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a frontline NATO state facing direct threats, Latvia's primary need is **unwavering U.S. and NATO commitment to collective defense under Article 5**. The visible presence of **U.S. rotational forces** and the **NATO eFP battlegroup** on Latvian soil is crucial for credible deterrence and reassurance. Latvia needs continued access to advanced **U.S. military equipment and technology** through FMS and other programs to modernize its defenses effectively (e.g., acquiring coastal defense systems, air defense, HIMARS). Efficient procurement processes and potential financial support mechanisms (like FMF or loan guarantees, though less common for wealthier allies) can facilitate this. Robust **intelligence sharing** and cooperation on **countering hybrid threats** (cyber defense support, strategic communications expertise) from the U.S. and NATO allies are vital for addressing threats below the threshold of conventional attack.

Economically, Latvia needs continued integration within the **EU single market** and access to **EU funds** (Cohesion funds, Recovery and Resilience Facility) which are critical for its infrastructure development, energy transition, and economic convergence. Support for **energy security** remains important; while Latvia has diversified from Russian gas, ensuring stable regional energy supplies (including access to LNG via regional terminals like Klaipėda in Lithuania or potentially future Latvian/Estonian projects) and support for its transition to renewable energy (wind, solar) are key needs. U.S. investment and technology can play a role here.

Diplomatically, Latvia needs strong **political support from the U.S. and allies** for its sovereignty and security, including clear condemnation of any Russian threats or provocations. It needs continued international solidarity in **supporting Ukraine** and maintaining pressure on Russia through sanctions. Support for Latvia's efforts to strengthen its **democratic institutions and societal resilience**, including managing the integration of its Russian-speaking minority constructively and countering disinformation, is also important. Finally, Latvia benefits from continued **U.S. trade and investment**, supporting its economic growth and strengthening transatlantic ties.
