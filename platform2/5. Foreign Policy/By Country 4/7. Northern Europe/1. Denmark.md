# **Denmark: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Kingdom of Denmark share a close and long-standing partnership based on shared democratic values, strong economic ties, and a mutual commitment to transatlantic security through NATO. As a founding member of NATO and a member of the European Union, Denmark is a key U.S. ally in Northern Europe, playing an important role in Baltic Sea security, Arctic governance, and global issues. The relationship encompasses robust defense cooperation, alignment on major foreign policy challenges, significant trade and investment, and collaboration on climate change and development aid. Current relations are **excellent and highly cooperative**, marked by strong alignment on supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression, strengthening NATO deterrence (particularly in the Baltic Sea region), close coordination within the EU, and partnership on Arctic issues (given Denmark's relationship with Greenland and the Faroe Islands).

### **Crises**

The primary crisis impacting Denmark is the **regional security crisis** stemming from Russia's aggression against Ukraine and its broader challenge to the European security order. This prompted Denmark's historic decision to abandon centuries of military non-alignment and join NATO. Adjusting to its new role as a NATO ally, integrating its forces into Alliance structures, and contributing to collective deterrence against Russia are key ongoing tasks within this crisis context. Relatedly, Denmark faces heightened risks from **Russian hybrid warfare**, including disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, espionage, and potential provocations in the Baltic Sea region or the Arctic. Maintaining societal resilience and enhancing capabilities to counter these threats are crucial.

Domestically, Denmark has faced challenges related to the **integration of large numbers of immigrants and refugees** received over recent decades, leading to social tensions and challenges in certain urban areas, including issues with organized crime and gang violence, which has become a significant political concern. While Denmark remains a stable democracy, managing these integration and security challenges is an ongoing focus.

Economically, Denmark, like other European nations, has dealt with **inflationary pressures** and energy price volatility following the war in Ukraine, though its economy remains strong and resilient. Ensuring long-term **energy security** and managing the **green transition** (Denmark is a leader in wind energy) while maintaining competitiveness are ongoing challenges.

Anticipated future crises primarily revolve around the **regional security environment**. Potential escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, further Russian aggression or provocations in the Baltic Sea or Arctic regions, or intensified hybrid threats against Denmark or its neighbors (Sweden, Germany, Baltics) pose significant risks. Maintaining NATO unity and deterrence, strengthening national defense, and enhancing societal resilience are key mitigation strategies. **Climate change impacts** (sea-level rise affecting its long coastline, Arctic changes impacting Greenland) also pose significant long-term risks. **Economic shocks** or global trade disruptions could affect its open economy.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Denmark is a valuable ally that makes significant contributions to U.S. regional and global goals, particularly in Northern Europe, the Arctic, and within NATO/EU frameworks. Historically and currently, Denmark is a committed **NATO ally**, contributing forces to Alliance missions (e.g., Baltic Air Policing, NATO maritime groups, historically in Afghanistan/Iraq) and hosting NATO infrastructure. Its strategic location controlling the **Danish Straits** (entrance to the Baltic Sea) makes it vital for maritime security and NATO operations in the region. Denmark possesses capable niche military capabilities, particularly its **navy** (experienced in maritime surveillance and Arctic operations) and **air force** (transitioning to F-35s). Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Denmark has been a strong **supporter of Ukraine**, providing significant military aid (including Harpoon missiles, Caesar howitzers, Leopard tanks, and leading F-16 training coalition efforts) and financial assistance, aligning closely with U.S. policy. As an **EU member state**, Denmark contributes to transatlantic coordination on sanctions against Russia, support for Ukraine, and other foreign policy issues. Denmark plays a crucial role in **Arctic governance** through its leadership of the Kingdom of Denmark (which includes Greenland and the Faroe Islands), participating actively in the Arctic Council (when active) and cooperating with the U.S. on Arctic security, scientific research, and sustainable development. It hosts important U.S. facilities in **Greenland** (Thule Air Base/Pituffik Space Base), which are critical for missile warning and space surveillance. Denmark is also a global leader in **renewable energy technology** (especially wind power) and **international development aid**, contributing to shared goals on climate change and global stability.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Denmark's continued strong commitment to **NATO collective defense**, including meeting defense spending pledges (moving towards 2% GDP) and modernizing its armed forces (F-35 integration, naval capabilities). Continued reliable **hosting of U.S. facilities in Greenland** and close cooperation on **Arctic security** (monitoring, domain awareness, search and rescue) are vital. Sustained robust **support for Ukraine** and maintaining pressure on Russia remain top priorities. Denmark's leadership in **Baltic Sea security**, potentially through enhanced naval contributions or hosting regional exercises/infrastructure, is encouraged. The U.S. seeks continued Danish leadership within the **EU** advocating for strong transatlantic ties, robust Russia policy, and coordinated approaches to China. Partnership on **green transition technologies** and promoting **global climate action** offers significant opportunities. Concrete actions could include Denmark increasing its naval presence in the Baltic, investing further in Arctic surveillance capabilities, co-leading initiatives on green shipping or wind energy technology, and maintaining high levels of aid to Ukraine. Accountability is maintained through NATO processes, bilateral defense consultations (including specific agreements regarding Greenland), Arctic Council cooperation, and EU/G7 coordination.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a key NATO ally in a strategic region, Denmark's primary need is the **continued U.S. commitment to European security through NATO**, particularly Article 5 guarantees and robust deterrence in the Baltic Sea region and the High North. U.S. leadership within NATO and close security cooperation provide essential reassurance against potential Russian threats. Denmark benefits from access to **U.S. military technology and intelligence sharing** to enhance its own defense capabilities and situational awareness.

Economically, Denmark needs a **stable and open global trading system** for its highly internationalized economy. It relies on strong **transatlantic trade and investment** and the **EU single market**. U.S. policies supporting free trade, avoiding protectionism, and upholding multilateral trade rules (WTO) are important. International cooperation on **climate change** and support for the **global green transition** align with Denmark's domestic priorities and economic strengths (wind energy sector).

Diplomatically, Denmark needs strong **U.S. partnership in managing Arctic issues**, balancing security concerns, environmental protection, and sustainable development, particularly concerning Greenland (where the U.S. presence at Pituffik requires ongoing dialogue and agreement). It seeks international cooperation within the **Arctic Council** framework. Support for **multilateralism** and international institutions (UN, EU, NATO, OSCE) where Denmark plays an active role is a core need. Continued international solidarity and burden-sharing in **supporting Ukraine** and maintaining pressure on Russia are also vital for Danish security interests. Finally, Denmark benefits from close **intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation** with the U.S. and allies to counter terrorism, cyber threats, and transnational crime.
