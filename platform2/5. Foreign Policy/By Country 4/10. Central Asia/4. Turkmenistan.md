**Turkmenistan: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The United States and Turkmenistan have maintained a relationship since the latter gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The U.S. has emphasized its interest in promoting regional stability, energy security, and counterterrorism efforts in Central Asia. Recently, the U.S. has been concerned about Turkmenistan's increasingly closed political system and human rights record. Despite these challenges, Turkmenistan remains a significant player in regional energy supply, particularly with its natural gas resources. The Biden administration has expressed interest in further engaging with Turkmenistan, especially in the context of diversifying energy sources and enhancing regional partnerships.

### **Crises**:

Turkmenistan currently faces several crises within its borders and in the surrounding region. Economically, the country has been grappling with declining revenues from its natural gas exports due to falling demand and prices, particularly from key markets like China. This economic strain could lead to social unrest and dissatisfaction among the populace, who face rising living costs. Additionally, the country’s authoritarian regime under President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow has restricted freedoms and stifled dissent, leading to a lack of public trust in the government's ability to address economic issues.

Regionally, Turkmenistan's neutrality policy has been tested by the evolving geopolitical landscape, particularly with the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan. This situation raises concerns about potential spillover violence and trafficking that could destabilize Turkmenistan. Moreover, the country has faced challenges in managing its borders, which are critical for maintaining its neutrality and security. The U.S. has been monitoring these developments closely, as they pose risks not only to Turkmenistan but also to the broader Central Asian region.

In terms of environmental crises, Turkmenistan is confronting severe water scarcity issues, exacerbated by climate change and poor management of the Aral Sea basin. This environmental degradation could lead to increased migration and regional tensions, especially with neighboring countries that share water resources. The government’s lack of transparency in addressing these environmental challenges further complicates the situation.

Finally, Turkmenistan anticipates crises related to internal dissent and potential rebel activity. The combination of an authoritarian regime, economic instability, and social discontent creates a volatile environment that could lead to unrest. The U.S. must consider these factors in its foreign policy approach to Turkmenistan, as they have implications for regional stability and U.S. interests.

**Frank Narrative**

Turkmenistan holds strategic importance for the United States, primarily due to its vast natural gas reserves and potential as an alternative energy supplier. The country is situated at the crossroads of major energy markets, offering the U.S. an opportunity to diversify its energy sources away from traditional suppliers. In this context, Turkmenistan's cooperation is vital for enhancing global energy security and reducing dependence on politically unstable regions. By engaging with Turkmenistan, the U.S. can help stabilize the region while promoting its own energy interests.

The potential for collaboration extends beyond energy security. Turkmenistan has been a partner in counterterrorism initiatives, particularly concerning threats that emanate from Afghanistan. The U.S. has previously provided training and support to Turkmen security forces to enhance their capacity to combat terrorism and maintain regional stability. Future cooperation could involve intelligence sharing and joint exercises to counteract the rise of extremist groups that could threaten both Turkmenistan and U.S. interests in the region.

In addition to security and energy, Turkmenistan can assist the U.S. in its diplomatic endeavors. The country has traditionally maintained a policy of neutrality, which allows it to act as a mediator in regional disputes. By fostering stronger ties with Turkmenistan, the U.S. can leverage this neutrality to facilitate dialogue among Central Asian countries, addressing shared challenges such as water security and economic development. This diplomatic engagement could further enhance U.S. standing in the region.

However, for the U.S. to achieve its goals, it must also consider what Turkmenistan needs from Washington. The country requires support for economic diversification to reduce its heavy reliance on energy exports. U.S. investment in infrastructure, technology, and education could help foster a more resilient economy. Furthermore, Turkmenistan seeks recognition as a legitimate player on the global stage, and the U.S. can assist by advocating for its participation in international organizations and forums.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

Turkmenistan faces numerous domestic challenges, particularly in economic diversification and governance. The country’s economy is heavily reliant on natural gas exports, which makes it vulnerable to price fluctuations and shifts in global energy demand. The U.S. can play a significant role in addressing these challenges by providing technological assistance and investment opportunities that promote economic diversification. Supporting initiatives in sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, and information technology can help Turkmenistan develop a more sustainable economic model.

In addition to economic support, Turkmenistan requires assistance in promoting democratic governance and human rights. The U.S. can engage with Turkmenistan to encourage reforms that enhance transparency and accountability in governance. By promoting civil society and the rule of law, the U.S. can help create an environment conducive to democratic change. This support can also include capacity building for governmental institutions to improve public service delivery and governance practices.

Moreover, Turkmenistan seeks to strengthen its security apparatus in response to regional threats. The U.S. can assist by providing training and resources to bolster Turkmenistan's ability to address terrorism and insurgency risks. Joint military exercises and intelligence sharing can enhance Turkmenistan's capacity to safeguard its borders and maintain internal stability. 

Finally, Turkmenistan's engagement in international organizations is crucial for its global integration. The U.S. can facilitate Turkmenistan's participation in regional forums and international agreements, providing the country with a platform to voice its interests and concerns. This engagement will not only enhance Turkmenistan's international standing but also create opportunities for multilateral cooperation on pressing regional issues.

**1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**

Turkmenistan is located in Central Asia, bordered by the Caspian Sea to the west, Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, and Iran to the south. The country covers approximately 491,210 square kilometers and has a population of around 6 million people. Turkmenistan's economy is largely based on its rich natural gas reserves, which contribute significantly to its GDP. In recent years, the GDP growth has slowed, reflecting challenges in the energy sector.

Additionally, Turkmenistan's neutrality in regional conflicts allows it to serve as a potential mediator in Central Asia. The U.S. has interests in promoting stability in the region, particularly concerning counterterrorism efforts and economic development.

**Democracy Score:**

Turkmenistan's political landscape is characterized by an authoritarian regime led by President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow since 2006. The ruling party, the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, maintains a tight grip on power, with limited political pluralism and no real competition in elections. Governance practices are marked by suppression of dissent, media censorship, and human rights abuses. The country lacks meaningful democratic freedoms, and civil society organizations operate under strict government control. The current regime's practices hinder the development of democratic institutions and limit citizens' rights to participate in governance.

**Historical Context:**

**Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**
Significant events that have shaped U.S.-Turkmenistan relations include Turkmenistan's independence in 1991, the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, and the signing of the U.S.-Turkmenistan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2004. A notable diplomatic breakthrough occurred in 2010 when Turkmenistan agreed to cooperate with the U.S. on counterterrorism efforts, reflecting mutual interests in regional stability. However, relations have faced challenges due to Turkmenistan's human rights record and limited political freedoms.

**Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**
Past agreements include the 2008 Framework Agreement on Energy Cooperation, which aimed to enhance energy security and promote the development of Turkmenistan's energy sector. The U.S. has also provided assistance in areas such as border security and counter-narcotics efforts. Bilateral relations have been strained by concerns over Turkmenistan's authoritarian governance and lack of progress on human rights issues, which have impeded deeper cooperation.

The U.S. can assist by providing intelligence and support for border security initiatives to address these threats.

**Military Cooperation, Alliances, or Conflicts:**
The U.S. has engaged in limited military cooperation with Turkmenistan, focusing on counterterrorism and border security. Joint exercises and training programs can enhance the capabilities of Turkmen security forces. Future collaboration may involve increasing military aid and resources to support Turkmenistan's efforts to combat regional threats.

**Diplomatic Influence:**

**Role in Regional/Global Diplomacy:**
Turkmenistan's neutrality policy enables it to act as a mediator in regional disputes, positioning it as a potential diplomatic partner for the U.S. in Central Asia. By engaging with Turkmenistan, the U.S. can leverage its influence to encourage dialogue among neighboring states, addressing common challenges such as water security and economic development.

**Potential for Multilateral Cooperation or Conflict Resolution:**
Turkmenistan's participation in regional organizations, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), provides opportunities for multilateral cooperation. The U.S. can support Turkmenistan's involvement in these forums to promote regional stability and address shared challenges through joint initiatives and dialogues.
