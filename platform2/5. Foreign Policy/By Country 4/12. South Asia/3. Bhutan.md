---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events

The United States and Bhutan have maintained a cordial and cooperative relationship since the establishment of formal diplomatic ties in 2008. Bhutan, a small landlocked kingdom nestled in the eastern Himalayas, has drawn attention for its unique approach to development, emphasizing Gross National Happiness (GNH) as a measure of progress. Recent events include Bhutan's efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which were characterized by rapid vaccination campaigns and strict public health measures. The U.S. has provided support through vaccine donations and technical assistance. Furthermore, Bhutan's strategic location between India and China positions it as a key player in regional stability, particularly concerning U.S. interests in countering Chinese influence in South Asia.

### **Crises**:

What, if any, crises is this country, and region currently facing, crises very recently overcome, or anticipating crises to occur in the near future? Include both county and region. Use full sentences and 4 paragraphs.

Currently, Bhutan faces several challenges, most notably the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has severely affected tourism, a critical sector for Bhutan's economy, leading to a decline in revenue and heightened unemployment rates. Additionally, Bhutan's dependence on India for trade and investment poses vulnerabilities, especially amid geopolitical tensions in the region. The economic recovery is a pressing priority, and Bhutan is working to diversify its economy to mitigate these risks.

Moreover, Bhutan has been proactive in addressing climate change, as it is particularly susceptible to the consequences of global warming, including glacial melt and increased natural disasters. The country's commitment to environmental preservation is commendable, but resources are limited, and greater international support is necessary to adapt to these challenges. The potential for rising internal conflict due to resource scarcity cannot be ignored, especially as communities compete for dwindling supplies.

In terms of regional dynamics, Bhutan's relationship with China remains tense, particularly over territorial disputes in the Doklam area. China’s increasing assertiveness in the region raises concerns for Bhutan and its allies, including India and the United States. The potential for conflict in this area could have significant ramifications, not only for Bhutan but also for regional stability and U.S. interests in countering Chinese expansion.

Looking ahead, Bhutan must navigate these complex challenges while maintaining its commitment to democracy and human rights. The nation’s political stability, characterized by a constitutional monarchy and democratic governance, is crucial for addressing these issues effectively. However, the potential for political unrest due to economic hardships or external pressures remains a risk that must be managed carefully.

**Frank Narrative**

Bhutan stands as a unique case study in the realm of international relations, particularly with its philosophy of Gross National Happiness guiding its policies. The U.S. has an interest in Bhutan's approach to sustainable development, which could serve as a model for other nations facing similar challenges. By fostering a deeper partnership, the U.S. can help Bhutan achieve its goals while also promoting democratic values and human rights. In this regard, Bhutan's commitment to environmental sustainability aligns with U.S. interests in combating climate change, making cooperation in this area particularly vital.

The geopolitical landscape in South Asia is shifting, with China seeking to expand its influence. Bhutan’s strategic positioning between India and China makes it a critical partner for the U.S. in maintaining regional stability. The U.S. can enhance its diplomatic relations with Bhutan by supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity, especially in the face of Chinese assertiveness. Encouraging Bhutan to strengthen its ties with India and the U.S. can create a united front to counterbalance China's growing power in the region.

Furthermore, Bhutan's focus on progressive governance and social equity aligns with U.S. values. Supporting Bhutan in its efforts to promote human rights, gender equality, and social justice will not only strengthen bilateral ties but also enhance Bhutan's reputation on the global stage. Collaborative projects aimed at empowering marginalized communities and fostering civic engagement can serve as a foundation for deeper cooperation between the two nations.

In conclusion, the U.S. must leverage its relationship with Bhutan to address shared concerns, such as climate change and regional security. By providing economic assistance, technological support, and fostering cultural exchanges, the U.S. can help Bhutan navigate its challenges while reinforcing its commitment to democratic governance. This multifaceted approach will not only benefit Bhutan but also contribute to broader U.S. strategic goals in the region.

**How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*Past and present contributions to U.S. strategic interests (e.g., counterterrorism, energy security).*

Bhutan has been a proactive participant in regional stability and counterterrorism efforts, primarily through its cooperation with India. The U.S. benefits from Bhutan's strategic location, as it serves as a buffer state against Chinese expansionism. Bhutan's commitment to maintaining a democratic political system and promoting human rights aligns with U.S. foreign policy objectives. In the future, we would like to see Bhutan take a more active role in regional forums, where it can contribute to discussions on security and economic cooperation.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

*Areas where U.S. support could address domestic challenges (e.g., economic diversification, technological assistance).*

Bhutan requires support in economic diversification to reduce its dependence on tourism and hydropower. The U.S. could provide technological assistance and investment in emerging sectors such as information technology, agriculture, and renewable energy. Additionally, financial aid for climate adaptation projects would help Bhutan mitigate the impacts of climate change, enhancing its resilience and stability.
