# **Greece: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

The United States and the Hellenic Republic (Greece) share a strong and enduring alliance based on shared democratic values, deep historical ties (including U.S. support for Greek independence and post-WWII reconstruction via the Truman Doctrine/Marshall Plan), significant people-to-people connections through a large Greek-American community, and a vital security partnership within NATO. Located strategically in Southeastern Europe at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, Greece is a key U.S. ally for promoting stability in the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Black Sea region. The relationship features robust defense cooperation, including U.S. access to important military facilities (Souda Bay, Alexandroupoli), alignment on regional security challenges, growing energy cooperation, and substantial economic ties within the EU framework. Current relations are **excellent and at a high point**, characterized by deepening defense collaboration, strong alignment on countering Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine, cooperation on energy diversification for Europe, and shared interests in Eastern Mediterranean stability.

### **Crises**

Greece continues to recover from the severe **sovereign debt crisis** that began in 2009-2010, requiring multiple international bailouts and years of painful austerity. While the economy has stabilized and returned to growth, challenges remain, including high public debt (though declining), non-performing loans in the banking sector (improving but still present), the need for continued structural reforms to boost competitiveness, and addressing social impacts from the crisis years. Ensuring sustainable long-term growth and resilience remains an ongoing task.

Regionally, Greece is significantly affected by **tensions with neighboring Turkey** in the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean over maritime boundaries, airspace, resource rights (hydrocarbons), and the status of Cyprus. While diplomatic dialogue has resumed recently leading to de-escalation, underlying disputes persist and carry a risk of accidental clashes or renewed crises. Greece also faces challenges related to **migration management**, serving as a major entry point for migrants and refugees arriving by sea (from Turkey) and land into the EU. Managing flows humanely, coordinating with Turkey and the EU, and integrating recognized refugees pose ongoing challenges. Instability in the broader **Eastern Mediterranean** (Libya, Syria, Lebanon) and the **Balkans** also impacts Greek security interests.

Like other Mediterranean countries, Greece is highly vulnerable to **climate change impacts**, including extreme heatwaves, devastating wildfires (as seen in recent summers), droughts, and potential impacts on tourism and agriculture. Adapting to climate change and accelerating the green transition are major long-term challenges.

Anticipated future crises could include renewed **tensions with Turkey**, potentially triggered by disputes in the Aegean or Eastern Mediterranean. **Economic shocks** (global recession, renewed Eurozone stress) could impact Greece's recovery. Worsening **regional instability** (Balkans, Middle East/North Africa) could create security or migration pressures. **Climate change impacts** are expected to intensify, potentially leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters like wildfires. Maintaining political stability domestically while navigating these external pressures is key.

### **How Can This Country Help the U.S. Achieve Its Regional Goals?**

*This is the single most important section of the proposal. It must be exceptionally well thought out, carefully researched using authoritative sources, and written in full, coherent sentences that clearly articulate both historical contributions and future potential.*

Greece is a critical ally for advancing U.S. strategic objectives in Southeastern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Black Sea region, and within NATO. Its most significant contribution is serving as a **vital NATO ally on the southeastern flank**, providing crucial geographic access and hosting key U.S. military facilities. **Naval Support Activity Souda Bay** in Crete is an indispensable logistical hub for U.S. naval and air operations across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The port of **Alexandroupoli** in northern Greece has emerged as a strategic hub for deploying U.S./NATO forces and equipment towards the Balkans and Black Sea region, bypassing the congested Turkish Straits, particularly important for supporting Ukraine and deterring Russia. Greece consistently contributes forces to **NATO missions** (maritime patrols, air policing, KFOR in Kosovo) and participates actively in Alliance exercises. It maintains capable armed forces (especially navy and air force) and is increasing its defense spending towards the 2% NATO target. Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Greece has been a strong **supporter of Ukraine**, providing humanitarian and military aid (within its capacity), enforcing sanctions against Russia, and facilitating aid transit via Alexandroupoli. This aligns directly with U.S. policy. Greece plays a key role in promoting **energy security and diversification** in Southeastern Europe, developing infrastructure for LNG imports (Revithoussa terminal, Alexandroupoli FSRU project) and regional interconnectors (gas pipelines like IGB with Bulgaria, electricity links), helping reduce regional dependence on Russian energy – a major U.S. goal. As an **EU member state**, Greece contributes to transatlantic coordination and supports EU policies aligned with U.S. interests (sanctions, enlargement in Western Balkans). It also engages diplomatically to promote **stability in the Eastern Mediterranean** and the **Western Balkans**.

Looking forward, the U.S. seeks Greece's continued and enhanced contributions. Maintaining robust **NATO commitments**, including defense spending and military modernization (e.g., acquiring F-35 aircraft), is essential. Continued reliable access to and Greek investment in **strategic bases like Souda Bay and Alexandroupoli** is critical. The U.S. encourages Greece to further develop Alexandroupoli as a multi-modal logistics hub supporting NATO's eastern/southeastern flank. Continued strong **support for Ukraine** and enforcement of **sanctions against Russia** are vital. Greece's role in **regional energy security** should be expanded, potentially becoming a key hub for LNG imports and clean energy transition (renewables, hydrogen) in Southeastern Europe, supported by U.S. investment/technology. The U.S. seeks continued Greek leadership in promoting **stability in the Eastern Mediterranean**, including constructive dialogue with Turkey to manage disputes peacefully within the framework of international law, and cooperation on maritime security. Greece's active engagement in supporting the **Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkans** is also important. Accountability is maintained through NATO processes, regular bilateral dialogues (U.S.-Greece Strategic Dialogue), and EU/G7 coordination.

**What Does This Country Need from the U.S./World?**

\**This section should equally match the rigor of the previous one: thorough research, complete sentences, and precise recommendations. In this context, “domestic” refers to challenges within the foreign country itself rather than the United States.* \*

As a key NATO ally in a complex region, Greece's primary need is **unwavering U.S. and NATO commitment to its security and sovereignty**, particularly concerning potential threats or challenges in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. The U.S. security relationship, including defense cooperation, access to advanced U.S. military technology (F-35s, naval upgrades), and clear political support for Greece's territorial integrity and rights under international law, is fundamental. Continued U.S. presence at Souda Bay and engagement in the region provide crucial reassurance.

Economically, Greece needs continued support for its **long-term economic recovery and sustainable growth**. This includes a stable European economic environment, continued access to **EU funds** (Recovery and Resilience Facility, Cohesion funds) for investment and reforms, and international partnerships (including U.S. investment) to boost competitiveness, innovation, and job creation. Support for Greece's role as a **regional energy hub** (LNG infrastructure, interconnectors, renewables) requires investment and technology cooperation from the U.S. and European partners.

Greece requires international cooperation and **burden-sharing within the EU framework to manage migration flows** effectively and humanely. As a frontline state, it needs financial and operational support from the EU (Frontex, AMIF funds) for border management, reception facilities, and asylum processing, as well as effective solidarity mechanisms for relocating asylum seekers. U.S. diplomatic support for these EU efforts and cooperation on addressing root causes of migration are beneficial.

Diplomatically, Greece needs international support, including from the U.S., for **peaceful resolution of disputes with Turkey** based on international law (UNCLOS). Consistent U.S. diplomacy encouraging dialogue and de-escalation while upholding principles of sovereignty and maritime rights is crucial. Support for the **Euro-Atlantic perspective of the Western Balkans**, a key Greek foreign policy priority, is also needed. Finally, Greece benefits from continued **U.S. trade and investment**, supporting economic growth and strengthening the bilateral partnership.
