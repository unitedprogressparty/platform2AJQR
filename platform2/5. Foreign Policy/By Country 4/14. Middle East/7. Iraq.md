# **Iraq: Strategic U.S. Foreign Policy Analysis**

---

### **Preface**

Current Relationship Description, including recent events:  
The relationship between the United States and Iraq has evolved significantly over the years, particularly following the U.S. invasion in 2003. Recent events have demonstrated a complex interplay of cooperation and tension. As of 2023, Iraq has faced ongoing political instability and challenges from various militant groups, prompting the U.S. to maintain a military presence to support Iraqi security forces. The U.S. has also been involved in efforts to promote democratic governance and economic stability in Iraq, despite challenges posed by corruption and sectarian divisions. Recent agreements include a strategic framework for cooperation, focusing on security, economic, and cultural ties.

### **Crises**:

Iraq is currently grappling with multiple crises, both internal and regional. The rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) has led to significant instability and violence, although the group has lost territorial control. However, remnants of ISIS continue to conduct insurgent operations, creating an ongoing threat to Iraqi security forces. Furthermore, Iraq's political landscape is fraught with tensions stemming from sectarian divisions and influence from neighboring Iran, which complicates governance and national unity. The recent protests over government corruption and the lack of basic services have highlighted the dissatisfaction of the Iraqi populace with their leaders.

In addition to these internal challenges, Iraq faces external pressures, particularly from its neighbors. The ongoing U.S.-Iran tensions have a direct impact on Iraq, as Iranian influence in the country has grown, creating a delicate balance for the Iraqi government. The potential for further violence and instability remains high, particularly if the U.S. were to withdraw its military presence or if Iran were to increase its influence in the region. As Iraq continues to navigate its complex geopolitical landscape, the potential for renewed conflict, sectarian violence, and instability looms large.

Moreover, Iraq faces economic challenges exacerbated by fluctuations in oil prices, which heavily impact its economy. The reliance on oil revenues has stunted economic diversification, making the country vulnerable to external economic shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained Iraq's public health system and economy, leading to increased unemployment and social unrest. As Iraq seeks to rebuild and stabilize, international assistance, particularly from the U.S., will be crucial in addressing these multifaceted crises.

With the backdrop of these crises, the U.S. has an opportunity to strengthen its partnership with Iraq by supporting reforms aimed at improving governance, economic stability, and security cooperation. Engaging with Iraq in a manner that respects its sovereignty while promoting democratic principles could pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future for the region.

**Frank Narrative**  
Iraq's strategic location in the Middle East makes it a vital partner for the United States in achieving regional stability. The U.S. has relied on Iraq to serve as a counterbalance to Iranian influence and to combat terrorism in the region. In the past, Iraq has contributed to U.S. strategic interests through cooperation in intelligence sharing, military operations against ISIS, and participation in regional security initiatives. Looking forward, the U.S. hopes to see Iraq take a more proactive stance in regional security efforts, reducing its dependence on Iranian support and fostering relationships with neighboring Arab states.

The U.S. has also emphasized the importance of economic diversification in Iraq as part of its foreign policy goals. By investing in sectors beyond oil, such as agriculture, technology, and infrastructure, Iraq can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The U.S. can assist Iraq in these efforts by providing technical assistance, facilitating trade agreements, and promoting private sector investment. A diversified economy will not only enhance Iraq's stability but will also contribute to broader U.S. economic interests in the region.

One of the most pressing challenges Iraq faces is the need for effective governance and the rule of law. The U.S. has consistently advocated for democratic reforms and anti-corruption measures in Iraq, as these are critical for establishing a stable political environment. The U.S. can support these efforts through capacity-building programs, promoting transparency, and encouraging civil society participation. Strengthening governance will help to restore public trust in institutions and reduce the likelihood of unrest and violence.

Finally, the U.S. must remain vigilant in addressing the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. With millions displaced and in need of assistance, the U.S. should prioritize humanitarian aid and support for internally displaced persons (IDPs). By addressing the immediate needs of the population, the U.S. can help foster goodwill and strengthen its relationship with the Iraqi government and people. A comprehensive approach that integrates security, economic, and humanitarian efforts will be essential in achieving long-term stability in Iraq.

### **1. Overview**

**Country Profile:**  
Iraq is located in the heart of the Middle East, bordered by Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria. It has a population of approximately 40 million, with a diverse ethnic and religious composition, including Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen. Iraq's GDP is predominantly driven by oil exports, which account for over 90% of government revenue. The country's quality of life has been severely affected by years of conflict, with challenges in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Iraq ranks low on various freedom indices, reflecting significant restrictions on political rights and civil liberties.

**Importance to National/Global Interests:**  
Iraq's rich oil reserves make it a critical player in global energy markets. Its location is pivotal for trade routes and regional security dynamics. The U.S. considers Iraq essential in countering terrorism, particularly ISIS, and as a partner in promoting stability in the Gulf region. Iraq's cooperation in intelligence sharing and military operations further aligns with U.S. strategic interests in combating extremism and maintaining regional balance.

**Democracy Score:**  
Iraq's political landscape is characterized by a parliamentary system, but the ruling parties often face accusations of corruption and ineffective governance. The current government, led by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani, has struggled to address pressing issues such as corruption, public service delivery, and security. While elections are held, the political process is marred by sectarian divisions, and genuine democratic freedoms remain limited. The lack of transparency and accountability continues to hinder Iraq's democratic development.

**Historical Context:**  
- **Key Milestones in Bilateral Relations:**  
  The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 marked a significant turning point in bilateral relations, leading to years of conflict and occupation. Historical events such as the signing of the Strategic Framework Agreement in 2008 and military withdrawal in 2011 shaped the current relationship. However, the resurgence of ISIS in 2014 prompted renewed U.S. military involvement to support Iraqi forces.
  
- **Previous Agreements, Conflicts, or Partnerships:**  
  Major agreements include the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement and the ongoing partnership in counterterrorism efforts. The relationship has been strained by issues such as Iranian influence, corruption, and governance challenges.
